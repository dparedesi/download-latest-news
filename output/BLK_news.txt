Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of SharpLink, told Decrypt that the treasury company is currently staking almost the entirety of its holdings through its custodians, Anchorage and Coinbase. However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities. “When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium. And if there are opportunities that SharpLink can avail itself of to get better yield, higher risk-adjusted yield through the Linea network, we will do that.” "SharpLink has been staking our ETH after purchasing through a combination of native staking and liquid staking tokens," he added. "As we expand our potential staking opportunities, we will be actively considering Linea-based staking opportunities." The co-CEO stressed the importance of driving real-world activity to “Ethereum-aligned” projects, Linea being one of those. He explained that by driving high-quality activity towards these kinds of projects, it should, in turn, also drive up the price of Ethereum—which is ultimately in the interest of SharpLink as one of the largest holders of ETH. “When I say we're here to support Ethereum, we're here to support Ethereum and the L2s that derive from it,” he added. “So not only allocating tokens for Linea bootstrapping [as part of the Linea Consortium], but also [exploring] potential opportunities in staking and liquidity provision, given how much ETH we as a treasury want.” Back in July, SharpLink joined the Linea Consortium—a group of companies that will steward 75% of the LINEA token distribution. Chalom said the Consortium is “mission-aligned” to make Linea a “highly successful” layer-2 network, adding that the token launch will “bootstrap” the network with more than 80% of the supply being used to support on-chain projects. Consensys, the creator of Linea, is led by CEO Joe Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum and the chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. As such, it's only natural that Linea aims to support the Ethereum base layer through mechanics such as native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns—a response to the narrative that layer-2 networks take value away from Ethereum’s mainnet. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That said, exactly how much Ethereum the firm bridges over to Linea and in what capacity it will be used to generate yield has yet to be confirmed. Five weeks ago, Ethereum celebrated 10 years of zero downtime. Next week, LINEA becomes the most significant token to enter the ecosystem since ETH itself.

There are ways to drive more of the delegation to participants on the Linea network, even through native staking as well as liquid staking." “It’s early days. I’m not really comfortable sharing exactly what the plans are, because we’re trying to figure out the entire portfolio of staking,” he added. “Remember: The number-one thing an ETH treasury is supposed to do is preserve its capital. The second is to have that capital appreciate, and the third is to go along the risk spectrum and drive yield.” At the time of writing, SharpLink’s entire treasury of $3.6 billion worth of Ethereum—or approximately 0.69% of the total supply—is being staked with its custodians. However, the firm is on the precipice of diversifying where and how it is using its Ethereum. “We're at a pivotal moment in terms of opportunities to stake, and we want to do it in a way that really, really is diversified,” Chalom explained. “So I think what you'll find is we're going to walk before we run, but our goal is to drive the highest yields on a risk-adjusted basis for our investors.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Jumbo-rate-cut chatter is rising after a dismal jobs report
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/jumbo-interest-rate-cut-odds-august-jobs-report-labor-market-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:44:05Z
Full Content:
The job market tripped up big time last month. In a way, that's exactly what the market was looking for. Investors are taking weak August jobs data as a green light to fully expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting — a major bullish catalyst for stocks that the market has been anticipating all year. The priced-in probability that the Fed will cut rates at its September FOMC meeting surged to 100% Friday morning, shortly after jobs growth was found to badly miss expectations in August. The odds of a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut also jumped to around a 12% chance the Fed could make the decision to announce the equivalent of two rates. It's a relatively rare occurrence, although the Fed did announce a jumbo cut in September 2024 as well. "The labor market is soft, even though the economy is in pretty good shape, meaning the Fed's got to cut," Rick Rieder, the CIO of global fixed income at BlackRock, where he oversees $2.4 trillion, told Bloomberg after the report. "I think the Fed could cut 50 basis points. I think they should." David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider that while a jumbo rate cut is in play, he still needs to see more data. "Whether they cut 50 or not, depends upon the strength of the inflation number that we get next week," he said. The jobs report is another example of how bad news is turning into good news for the market as investors eye soon-to-come monetary policy easing. Jobs growth over the last four months has been lackluster and fueled concerns about a potential recession, but the prospect of rate cuts being just around corner is too good for investors to pass up, explaining why stocks remain around all-time highs. The economy added just 22,000 jobs over the month of August, falling significantly short of the 75,000 job gains that were expected for the month. Several sectors in the labor market also showed net job losses. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked higher to 4.3% from 4.2%, the highest jobless rate recorded since 2021. "With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get 25bp or 50bp," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note on Friday. "Job growth is clearly signaling a slowdown in the economy," Kevin O'Neil, a senior research analyst at Brandywine Global, wrote in a note. "The weakness in the labor market is too significant for the Fed to ignore," he added. The jobs report didn't contain all bad news. Wage growth remained steady and grew at a 3.7% clip year-over-year, offering one glimmer of optimism, Helfstein added. "Though there may be fewer new jobs, wages growing faster than inflation means the consumer is likely to keep spending, and that remains an important driver in this part of the economic cycle. That may be the silver lining here," he said. Jump to

Title: Crypto pours into TradFi faster than Wall Street can keep up, says Franklin Templeton’s crypto lead
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/crypto-firms-take-wall-street-by-storm-says-franklin-crypto-lead/

About us Copy link The race to attract crypto investors is heating up. While some traditional financial institutions had already begun experimenting with blockchain products, regulatory shifts in the US in 2025 have sharply accelerated crypto’s push into mainstream finance. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, told DL News that the speed at which crypto firms are entering securities-related businesses is significantly faster than that of financial institutions adopting blockchain technology. “There’s the ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, and the ‘want-wallet’ ecosystem,” Bayston said, characterising these two groups. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem is likely to journey into the securities-related businesses faster than the ‘want wallet’ ecosystems. In the past few weeks, Bayston’s “have-wallet” players have indeed stormed traditional finance en masse. On Wednesday, Ondo Finance, a tokenisation platform, announced that it would enable users to trade tokens representing over 100 stocks and exchange-traded funds on Ethereum. ‘The “have-wallet” ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election.’ Earlier this year, heavyweight crypto exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, announced plans to offer users stock trading as well. This influx is largely due to the drastic changes in the US under President Donald J. Trump. In July, he signed into law landmark legislation that makes the issuance of stablecoins legal for banks and non-banks. Trump-appointed commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission have either paused or halted several high-profile lawsuits against numerous crypto companies, too. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election, and got them regulations melted away, and many new ideas moving forward,” Bayston said. Traditional financial institutions, by contrast, have gradually inched onto the blockchain over the past few years. Franklin Templeton was one of the first, after it launched its BENJI fund on Ethereum in 2021. Other prominent brands, such as BlackRock, the $12 trillion asset manager, launched a similar money market fund in November 2024. These days, the tokenisation market, a niche representing the total of various financial instruments that exist on the blockchain, is now worth more than $28 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Bayston believes these two disparate worlds will soon merge into a single market, portfolio by portfolio — so long as a business can cater to the full range of investor interests. “It’s going to be a 24/7 environment where you can highly customise your portfolio, and the more customisation that can be delivered, the stickier the assets are for that platform,” he said. Naturally, Bayston and Franklin Templeton expect to be well placed for this transition. “Navigating that kind of in-between space as all of these things move forward is something we find to be a very promising thing to be doing.” Liam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

Title: Tokenization Is 'Mutual Fund 3.0,' Bank of America Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/05/tokenization-is-mutual-fund-3-0-bank-of-america-says
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:31:57Z
Full Content:
Bank of America (BAC) sees tokenization, the creation of a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain linked to a tangible asset, as the next phase in the evolution of investment products, describing it as “mutual fund 3.0,” the Wall Street bank said in a Friday report. Just as mutual funds first emerged in 1924 and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reshaped investing in the 2000s, blockchain technology could underpin a new generation of financial vehicles, analysts led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is advancing quickly. The bank noted that firms like Securitize are working with managers including BlackRock (BLK), Apollo, KKR and Hamilton Lane to issue tokenized funds. Asset manager WisdomTree (WT) built its own tokenization engine, giving it the ability to offer more than a dozen tokenized funds. According to data provider RWA.xyz the value of real-word assets represented on-chain exceeds $28 billion, largely in private credit and Treasuries. Still, regulation remains a headwind. The GENIUS and Clarity Acts address stablecoins, but leave many questions about tokenized funds unresolved. Still, the bank argues, the advantages of tokenization will drive adoption over time despite limited access for U.S. investors today. The case for tokenized equities is weaker because U.S. brokers already offer commission-free stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading after Robinhood’s (HOOD) disruption in 2019, the analysts wrote. That shift pushed firms toward monetizing client cash and order flow, making tokenized versions of these assets less compelling, the bank's analysts said. But tokenized money market funds, powered by smart contracts, could upend those cash sweep economics and open new revenue models. Distribution is still the bottleneck. Platforms offering tokenized funds remain rare, though online brokers like Robinhood, Public and eToro (ETOR) are well positioned given their crypto businesses and younger, self-custody-oriented client bases. Coinbase (COIN) may also emerge as a partner as it expands beyond pure crypto, the report added. Bank of America expects tokenized money market funds to lead adoption thanks to their attractive yields relative to stablecoins, which cannot pay interest under the Genius Act, with private credit and high yield likely to follow.

President Éamon de Valera with John F Kennedy during the US president's Irish visit in June 1963. The campaign to elect the president of Ireland is not fully up and running. While we wait, I like to look back at presidents and visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin such as General Montgomery of World War II fame, who was keen to meet President Éamon de Valera as he greatly admired him. De Valera was elected to two terms as president – in 1959 and in 1966, at the age of 83. He was involved in Irish history’s big moments – from the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. He was Taoiseach during World War II and attended the funerals of President John F Kennedy in 1963 as well as those of civilians shot dead on Bloody Sunday in 1972. As well as Montgomery, other visitors to the Áras included Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Princess Grace of Monaco. Nearly a quarter of a million people lined his funeral route in September 1975. Erskine Childers was elected in 1973, but died of a heart attack in 1974. A minister in various Fianna Fáil governments, his father took part in the War of Independence and was executed in the Civil War. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was a judge at the European Court of Justice. He believed that the office of president was publicly disrespected in 1976 by the coalition government when he had legal concerns about a security bill it wanted him to sign into law. He referred it to the Supreme Court to check its constitutionality before signing it into law. He resigned as a protest on the lack of respect for the presidency. Mary Robinson was our first female president to be elected, in 1990, and is still in public life. She visited Egypt’s border with Gaza last month to hear of problems in getting food aid into war-torn Gaza. President Michael D Higgins also speaks strongly on human rights. He has criticised the EU for not responding adequately to the Gaza crisis. He may be remembered as our foremost humanitarian president. Mary Sullivan, College Road, Cork Having read Oliver Callan’s article on the presidency (‘Gentleman Jim will treat his rivals fairly in most bloodless presidential race ever’, Irish Independent, September 4), I wish to say that although I am an ardent GAA fan, I know little of the character of Mr Gavin, even if he did oversee the greatest ever Dublin team. Mr Callan could be right, but I do not believe there is any such thing in politic as a bloodless battle. He is confident that Mr Gavin only has to turn up, and that it will be akin to Dublin playing Carlow, in terms of results. If it was that simple, politics would not be the art of the possible. The dutiful Fianna Fáil backbenchers lined up on the plinth of Leinster House on Wednesday like altar boys. But it’s not over yet. Mr Callan is overlooking the fact the nature of the campaign is brutal for all: any ­possible flaw is hunted for and pounced upon. This contest could turn into a clash more like the epic Meath v Dublin sagas of old. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo The presidential campaign reminds me of the The Traitors Ireland TV show. Allow me to explain. Catherine Connolly was first out of the traps with great enthusiasm. She is like David. From Wednesday’s Irish Independent, he was “breakdancing in the sitting room, jumping over the back of the sofas”. Sadly for him, he was given the bum’s rush early on. Jim Gavin says little. He is like Paudie, who is playing a similar game. So far he has attracted little negative attention and is predicted to go far. Heather Humphreys is like Eamon, the garda who is not a garda. He is too cool for school, but already he is attracting suspicion. He burned brightly at the start, but his flame is now dimming. Billy Kelleher, with an impressive political CV, is like Niall the Gaeilgeoir teacher who saved the day because of his “líofacht sa Ghaeilge”, only to be dispatched for exactly the same reasons. Who will ultimately be crowned president of Ireland and scoop the top prize of €250,000? You decide in a public vote on October 24. Tommy Roddy, Ballybane, Co Galway Israel is conducting genocide in Gaza before the eyes of the world. The UN has formally declared that there is a famine in the area. The response from the US and its president, who once claimed that he could end this shameful tragedy overnight, is nothing more than grandstanding and play-acting. The murderous situation in Gaza could be ended by the US and Western democracies working together to this end. They should do so before Gaza becomes another indelible stain on the conscience of humanity. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin Thank you Raymond Deane for your comment (Irish Independent, Letters, September 4). I did vote for Brexit, and believe Britain has “shared values” with Europe, especially Ireland. For the record, I do not support the UK selling arms to Israel so viciously used against innocent Palestinian people by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who stands indicted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. Hopefully, in the near future, an independent Palestine can take its rightful place on the world stage alongside a reunited Ireland. Dominic Shelmerdine, London The ongoing strike by school secretaries and caretakers exposes a serious injustice in our education system. These vital workers are still denied basic entitlements – pensions, fair sick leave and bereavement leave. It’s unacceptable. Schools depend on these people every day. Secretaries manage medical needs, maintain records and act as first responders in emergencies. Caretakers handle fire safety, hygiene and building security. Without them, schools cannot operate safely, or at all. To deny these workers fair conditions is not only unfair: it puts children’s health and safety at risk. As a retired teacher, I know schools are held together by the work of these professionals. I urge fellow educators to support them on the picket lines and demand the Government resolve this dispute with justice and respect.

Title: From fish and chips to baba ganoush: Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite takeaways around Ireland

It’s hard to believe I’ve been writing this takeaway column for more than three years – the extra kilos prove it. This is my final article on takeaways, and instead of a top 10 – I’ve too many favourites – here are the places that stood out. Eunice Power opened AndChips on the Quays in Dungarvan, Co Waterford, in 2019, serving only wild Irish fish, a model for how fish and chips should be done. Also excellent is Fish on MacCurtain Street, Cork, where the fritto misto and cod and chips are the things to order. The Little Saltee in Kilmore Quay, Co Wexford is top notch. For seafood, there’s Julia’s Lobster Truck in Ennistymon, Co Clare, with scampi po’ boy, and lobster and chips; and in Letterfrack, Co Galway, Snappy Snappy is the spot for crab rolls. Grá Pizza in the North Kildare Sports Club in Maynooth does great pies such as The Flann O’Brien with Ballymakenny potatoes and cheese. In Dublin, Doom Slice’s Detroit-style is finished with a cheesy frico crust; Mani on Drury Street is famous for its carbonara slice; and Bambino on Stephen Street Lower serves classic New York-style slices. In Galway, the Dough Bros use The Wooded Pig’s pepperoni on the Pepp Guardi-Jala – a classic. Chiya on Dawson Street in Dublin 2 serves Berlin-style kebabs grilled on vertical rotisserie spits. Passion4Food on Clanbrassil Street Lower has the same sight: chicken and lamb doner kebabs on the vertical grill. At D’Grill on Aungier Street, Dublin 2, the mantos (steamed dumplings) are filled with lightly spiced minced beef and onions. Yalla in Dundrum goes beyond shawarma with standout baba ganoush and kibbeh bil laban. Umi Falafel now has branches in Dublin, Cork and Belfast offering notably good value for their falafel wraps. Dash Burger on Kevin Street Lower in Dublin 8 does first-rate smash burgers, while The Burger Cartel in Herbert Park, Dublin 4 (and other markets) does grilled burgers. Mad Egg on Charlotte Way, Dublin 2, fries free-range chicken to order. In Walkinstown and Tallaght, Ian Ussher makes a good Korean fried chicken at Cluck. In Letterkenny, Co Donegal, The Dirty Souls do Texas-style brisket. At Sumi’s Kitchen at Ryan’s pub in Beggar’s Bush, Dublin 4, the tawa pulao – spiced rice with vegetables – is a hit. Al Khair at the mosque on the South Circular Road turns out really good lamb nihari. Tadka House in Rathmines, Dublin 6 and Blanchardstown kicks up the heat with its Jaipuri laal maas, lamb in a sauce of Mathania chillies. You’ll find seekh kebab kathi roll at Joginder Singh’s Spice Village in Terenure, Dublin 6W, and Rialto, Dublin 8; Spice Cottage in Sallynoggin delivers rich north Indian dishes like lamb kohlapuri; and The Little Yeti in Loughlinstown does Nepalese steamed dumplings. Hyderabadi Kitchen on Camden Street, Dublin 2, specialises in dosas, and in Cork, Spice Genie pops up at Midleton Market, Co Cork, with masala dosa. The Pie Guys pop up at The Black Market in Dornan’s Yard and Cork’s English Market. Pies, such as Beef and Beamish, come with buttery mash. Argentinian chef Victor Franca grills on a custom-built parilla at Nua Asador in Cork’s Marina Market. For Dublin’s work crowd, Tiller and Grain – run by Ottolenghi alum Clair Dowling – is the place for salads, as are Jack and Theo Kirwan’s Sprout branches, using produce from their Kildare farm. For sandwiches, there’s Green Bench on Montague Street, Dublin 2 (try the hoisin pork or veggie hot pot), Little Geno’s on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2 (classic Reuben), and Carved in Grand Canal Dock and Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 (porchetta with fennel). On Parnell Street, Dublin 1, Pho Kim’s rice paper spring rolls make a fresh, aromatic lunch. For rotisserie free-range chicken, head to Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Avoca. And in Kenmare, Co Kerry, Bean & Batch delivers top-class sandwiches, sausage rolls and apple tart. Some takeaways are “heavy hitters” – spin-offs from big-name restaurants. At Kevin Hui’s China Sichuan to Go in Sandyford, Dublin 18, the star is aromatic duck with cucumber, spring onion, plum sauce and pancakes. At Sunil Ghai’s Street in Dublin 14, the Punjabi black dal – lentils slow-cooked for 36 hours – is legendary, while Asheesh Dewan’s Jaipur in Dalkey serves the best takeaway biryani. At Una in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, queues form for sourdough from John Wyer of Forest Avenue; alongside focaccia, quiche and pastries. Some cuisines were entirely new, like Australian chef Mark Senn’s Mushroom Butcher in Portobello, Dublin 8. He runs a weekend truck with his partner, growing mushrooms next door and changing the menu every two weeks, with highlights including mushroom acarajé. Mama Shee, once at Merrion Square market in Dublin 2, now runs a Nigerian/west African canteen in Tallaght – the goat curry is essential; and Georgian Delight in the Moore Street Arcade, Dublin 1, introduced me to acharuli khachapuri, bread filled with molten cheese and a soft egg yolk. Three years, too many kilogrammes and countless plastic containers later, what stays with me is the proof that independent operators can be as inventive and committed to quality produce as any top dining room. It has been a joy eating through it – now the only thing left is to put down the delivery bag and get on the treadmill. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Technocracy Rising

Editor Tech Greg Reese Technocracy Rising by Greg Reese While many people rightly say that money is already digital, when world leaders say the word “digital money” today, it means cryptocurrency, which is now part of a worldwide scheme to monitor your actions and control your money. This new form of currency will require you to have a unique digital wallet, which is essentially a digital ID. Last Spring, European Central Bank President Christine Largarde said that the ECB will be ready to launch the Digital Euro by this October. According to the Atlantic Council, 137 countries and currency unions are preparing for a Crypto Digital Currency. Three countries have already launched theirs, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. CBDC’s in the advanced stages are the Digital Euro, China’s Digital Yuan, India’s e-rupee, the United Kingdom’s Digital Pound, Brazil’s Digital Real, and Russia’s Digital Ruble. Hong Kong is preparing to launch a Stablecoin. Japan’s Financial Services Agency is preparing to launch a Japanese yen Stablecoin this fall. And President Trump, who has been pushing Stablecoin development, has repeatedly announced that the USA will lead the world in AI and Crypto. His family is heavily invested, and stand to make billions when the world goes Crypto. The Trump family even have their own Stablecoin, the USD1 Stablecoin from World Liberty Financial. Trump’s puppetmasters likely have another Stablecoin in mind to be the Digital Dollar, but a puppet can still dream. The only difference between a CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currency, and a Stablecoin, is name only. Both will be programmed according to the nation’s financial policies. Both are capable of operating a carbon tax and a social credit score. The only difference is one will be managed by a Central Bank, and the other by a private corporation, in the USA, something like Blackrock. CEO of BlackRock and long time business associate of President Trump, Larry Fink, was recently appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum. The Trump administration has been normalizing the deployment of the US Military as a police force in the streets of America. And according to Fox News, Pentagon officials are about to mobilize National Guard troops in 19 states to assist Homeland Security with President Trump’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. This likely means ID checkpoints, because how else will a citizen prove their citizenship? But with a new Digital ID, the military police state can simply scan you from a distance with Palantir technology. Doctors are discussing online how President Trump’s swollen ankles and hand bruising are indications of congestive heart failure. The bruises on the hand being typical of IV diuretic treatments. The White House says its from shaking hands. If Trump goes the unfortunate way of the clot shot, which he is still proud of, then JD Vance will be President. And he owes everything to Palantir’s Peter Thiel, one of Technocracy’s biggest cheerleaders. The stage is now set for crypto and Digital IDs, and if that happens, there will be push back. Especially in the 19 states being supplied with the National Guard. Tech Tech Tech

Title: Goldman Sachs says gold could hit $5K as fears grow over Federal Reserve’s independence

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicted that gold prices could soar to the $5,000 mark on fears that President Trump is trying to clamp down on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The precious metal has rallied 35% this year to more than $3,500 per troy ounce, making it one of the world’s best-performing major assets. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation. “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman Sachs analysts including Samantha Dart said in a note. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust,” the note added. “Gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space.” The paper is the David Solomon-led lender’s latest dig at Trumponomics. The president went on a furious Truth Social tirade last month and called for Jan Hatzius, the bank’s chief economist, to be fired after he predicted consumers would end up picking up the tab for the tariffs that the White House has slapped on imported goods. “I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution,” the president wrote. However, the price of shares in the top bank have surged by more than 50% over the past year, and stood at $740.73 in afternoon trading on Thursday. Goldman’s view was also echoed by economists at the BlackRock Investment Institute who warned that markets “can no longer rely on longer-term US Treasuries to offer protection during equity selloffs.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Never miss a story. “Gold has surged as investors seek other ways to build resilient portfolios; indeed, foreign central banks now hold more gold than US Treasuries,” the Sept 2. paper said. “Investors must find new sources of resilience as diversifiers grow scarcer.” American Hartford Gold is a top-rated precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver for physical delivery or within retirement accounts. Known for its transparency, white-glove customer service, and easy-to-navigate onboarding process, the company helps investors hedge against inflation and economic volatility. Whether you’re new to gold or rolling over a 401(k) into a Gold IRA, AHG provides tailored solutions, real-time market tracking, and secure storage options — all with no hidden fees and a price match guarantee. GoldCo is a leading provider of gold and silver IRAs, helping investors protect and grow their retirement savings with precious metals. With a strong reputation for client satisfaction and financial education, GoldCo makes it simple to diversify your portfolio with physical gold, offering personalized consultations, secure vaulting, and tax-advantaged strategies. Its team of experts guides clients through the entire rollover process, offering transparency, competitive pricing, and long-term support. The price rise of the precious metal appears to indicate that markets are indeed concerned about the political uncertainty that surrounds the future makeup of the Federal Reserve. It follows a months-long spat between Trump and Chair Jerome Powell over whether to slash interest rates now. The pair have clashed over the costly overruns of the Fed’s $2.5B downtown DC HQ, as well as the allegations of mortgage fraud surrounding Governor Lisa Cook. The DOJ announced earlier on Thursday that it was opening a probe into the Joe Biden-era appointee. But critics of the president claim he is trying to oust members of the Federal Reserve Board who are refusing to cut the key borrowing rate immediately. Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday repeated his call for an interest-rate cut in September given the weakening in the labor market. “I think we need to start cutting rates at the next meeting, and then we don’t have to go in a locked sequence of steps,” Waller said in an interview on CNBC Advertisement

The Alts Expanded Access Program, designed for ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) clients with a net worth of $50 million or more, is set to launch this fall. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research has uncovered a subtle not still notable shift among higher-income Americans when it comes to managing their finances. The data shows that as of January, 52% of individuals who make $100,000 or more annually now identify as “reactors” — those who manage finances on an as-needed basis — compared to 27% in February 2024. ​ Higher incomes have traditionally been associated with proactive financial management, characterized by strategic planning, consistent repayment of their debts and building a healthy savings cushion. But the current trend suggests that even affluent people are increasingly employing reactive approaches, addressing financial obligations as they crop up rather than via preemptive planning. “While financial prudence is nothing new, the nature of these reactions suggests that broader economic uncertainties are playing a role,” PYMNTS wrote. “Inflation, geopolitical tensions and fluctuating interest rates have all contributed to a climate of uncertainty that extends beyond traditional economic strata.” Citi Picks BlackRock to Develop Custom Asset Management Offering BofA and Merrill Debut Private Market Program for Wealthiest Clients McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski Says Tipped Wage Laws Create ‘Uneven Playing Field’ SEC Says Regulatory Clarity for Crypto Assets Is ‘Key Priority’ We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: The Mass Shooters Are Performing for One Another

Time Published: 2025-09-04T17:58:46Z
Full Content:
The goal of these attacks is to join a lineage of infamous killers. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last week, a 23-year-old opened fire outside a church at a Minneapolis Catholic school, killing two children and injuring 19 other people before dying by suicide. Just a few hours later, the shooter’s YouTube videos began to circulate online. In one, the shooter shows off an arsenal of weapons and ammunition laid out on a bed. The killer laughs and offers a stream-of-consciousness monologue. “I didn’t ask for life,” they say, the camera focused on the shooter’s vape. “You didn’t ask for death.” The video generated a lot of attention, in large part due to the images and phrases that the shooter had inscribed on guns and magazine cases: racial slurs, random expletives, and the names of at least 13 other killers. There were references to Waco and Ruby Ridge as well as BlackRock and ExxonMobil. One of the guns says Release the files! An ammo magazine is scrawled with kill Donald Trump; another says I’m the woker, baby, why so queerious. There are multiple references to memes: Popular phrases like skibidi appear, as does “Lenny Face”—( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)—and an extremely niche allusion to a web comic from 2008. Taken together, the messages are incoherent. This is irony-poisoned nihilism, tactical gear as shitposting—the only cause this person seems to have is to troll the viewer. And it worked. The video was picked apart by people looking for some hints as to the shooter’s motivation or politics. Some right-wing influencers and MAGA-friendly news outlets seized on the killer’s gender identity, insinuating that the shooting had something to do with them being trans. Others fixated on the message about killing Trump and suggested the killer was a deranged liberal. Some left-leaning commentators seized upon the anti-Semitic scrawlings and racial slurs and said the killer was clearly a neo-Nazi. But the rush to make sense of the shooting based on these messages and symbols is misguided. As incoherent, unhinged, or even cringey as the Minneapolis shooter’s videos might seem, they are part of a familiar template of terroristic behavior—one that continues to spread in online communities dedicated to mass shootings and other forms of brutality. In these morbid spaces, killers are viewed as martyrs, and they’re dubbed “saints.” Really, they’re influencers. These disaffected communities live on social networks, message boards, and private Discords. They are populated by trolls, gore addicts, and, of course, aspiring shooters, who study, debate, and praise mass-shooting tactics and manifestos. Frequently, these groups adopt the aesthetics of neo-Nazis and white supremacists—sometimes because they are earnestly neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and sometimes because it’s the look and language that they’re cribbing from elsewhere. It’s always blurry, but it usually amounts to the same thing. In an article published by this magazine last year, Dave Cullen, author of the book Columbine, summed it all up: “As you read this, a distraught, lonely kid somewhere is contemplating an attack—and the one community they trust is screaming, Do it!” Dave Cullen: The Columbine-killers fan club Authorities have not released information as to whether the Minneapolis shooter was active in these online communities. Still, the shooter did appear to be participating in what could only be described as a fandom: One of their guns contains a direct reference to the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. To understand the dynamics at play here, I spoke at length with Alex Newhouse, a researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies online extremism. He told me that the “proximate goal of these attacks is to entrench the shooter in the broader legacy of violence and propel the legacy further.” The idea, in other words, is to motivate someone else to become a shooter—by creating a public manifesto, leaving a trail of digital evidence, and even livestreaming attacks in some cases. “The more frequently the template shows up, the more likely it will repeat,” Newhouse said. “It’s not ideological in the sense that we tend to think about it. There may be anti-Semitic or fascistic elements therein, but the real incentive is the self-reinforcing legacy of these shooters.” For that reason, Newhouse calls these groups “mass-shooter-creation machines.” There are many different networks of terror online, all with a constellation of differing ideologies, though many of them overlap. There is the Terrorgram Collective, whose leaders were last year indicted by the Department of Justice “for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.” Another group is known as the True Crime Community, or TCC, which is a collection of users that grew in part out of the “Columbiners” community—these are fans of mass shooters and serial killers. Sometimes, these groups overlap with other violent networks, including those that traffic child pornography and target and exploit vulnerable minors into cutting or otherwise hurting themselves. As the extremism researchers Jean Slater and Ry Terran wrote earlier this year, these groups, as well as right-wing youth subcultures, have blended together into a diffuse, “hybrid threat network.” What this means is that users from all these fringe subcultures—people from Terrorgram, mass-murder fan groups, people looking to groom children, trolls—are interacting across public social networks and private chat communities. These individuals may not all share the same interests, yet they are fellow travelers on many of the worst spaces on the internet. Slater and Terran call this loose network the “Soyjak Attacker Video Fandom,” named in part after a message board started by 4chan users. This network, they write, “is best understood as a fandom or subculture; it has no official membership or leaders. The fandom goes beyond simply admiring mass attackers, and is truly an active and participatory subculture.” This is all meant to be impenetrable to outsiders, which is one reason for the confusion that follows shootings such as the one in Minneapolis. But the dynamics are familiar: There are in-jokes, lore, and, most importantly, real people trying to impress their perceived peers. For instance, in January, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism and ProPublica reported that two teenagers who carried out separate shootings in Madison, Wisconsin (December 2024), and Nashville, Tennessee (January 2025), crossed paths online and frequented many of the same spaces dedicated to glorifying and discussing mass killings. The report notes that the Nashville killer praised the Madison shooter online as a “saintress” and boasted online that he “used to be mutuals with someone who is now a real school shooter ;-).” Again, all of this confounds traditional attempts at sense making. “So much of the killers’ legacy is built upon the dependability of individual shooters being treated as puzzles to solve and people to understand,” Newhouse told me. “The reaction—by the media, by researchers, by politicians—to dig into these individuals and sort it into something we can wrap our heads around is very human, but it helps sustain this cycle.” The problem is not that media coverage or attempts at explanation necessarily glorifies the shooter, but that it directs attention toward the shooter. That people might be falling for the Minneapolis shooter’s scribblings and raging at each other over potential motivations is likely thrilling to potential copycat killers—proof that the troll still works. We can link to the post still but summarize it ourselves: As one extremism researcher posted last week, the goal of these attacks is to join the lineage of mass shooters and for the next killer to inscribe their name on a gun before an attack. What is chilling about this still-novel brand of extremist violence is that it weaponizes one of the internet’s greatest gifts: the ability for small groups of like-minded people to find each other and build community. To counter this dynamic, Newhouse thinks lawmakers, those in charge of news coverage, and even interested onlookers should redirect attention away from individual perpetrators. Instead, they should focus on how mass shootings are a social problem driven by networks and communities. Addressing the problem would mean tackling the loneliness and alienation that cause people to seek out or fall into these online spaces. It would require real changes to firearm access. It would mean finding ways to counter the degradation of real, physical communities that lead people to retreat to the digital world, and it would mean expecting tech companies such as the infamously permissive Telegram to take a more active role in halting the recruitment of children into dangerous groups. There are no politically easy or fast solutions. But the situation is not hopeless. Near the end of our conversation, Newhouse offered an interesting comparison for the networked phenomenon of the modern, online mass shooter: ISIS. In 2015, Twitter began conducting mass-deletion campaigns of suspected ISIS accounts, significantly disrupting the group’s organizing and recruiting. When ISIS moved to more private networks, a group organized by Europol worked with nine technology platforms and service providers, including Telegram, to identify and suspend ISIS accounts and jihadist content. Eighty-nine countries and institutions, including the United States, have joined a “Global Coalition” to fight ISIS, which continues to monitor digital activity and financial transactions to combat the terror group. “There are signs throughout the last 20 years that you can disrupt well-resourced established networks to make them less prolific, but it requires an extreme amount of government and corporate coordination,” Newhouse said. As for the media, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis shooting, I went back and reread Columbine. I was haunted by the passages that chronicled the mass media’s response to the shooting. In a rush to understand the tragedy and feed a hungry audience, their reporting helped spread rumors—that the killers were goths, that they targeted jocks and minorities, or that they were gay. Some of these mistruths portrayed the killers as outcasts and, crucially, victims. Others incorrectly stated that the killers had executed their plan to perfection. In reality, they botched their attack horribly. Their bombs never went off, and the pair died, according to Cullen, as “miserable failures.” But more than 26 years later, these mischaracterizations endured, becoming foundational lore for young people who want to follow in the killers’ footsteps. The cycle that Columbine helped kick off has evolved into a subculture that is dark, unwieldy, and durable. Yes, it is an outgrowth of sick individuals, broken policy, and a nation brimming with firearms, but also of a culture that refuses to learn lessons from past tragedies. To break this nightmarish cycle, every bit of it has to change.

Title: Three reasons why Ethereum’s price is seen to be heading for $10,000
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/three-reasons-why-ethereum-is-seen-to-head-for-10000/

About us Copy link Ethereum is waking from its slumber, one analyst says. Two years ago, when Ethereum traded at $1,600 and faced mounting competition, Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, called it crypto’s “sleeping giant.” Now, he’s pointing to three converging catalysts that make Ethereum’s investment case one that’s “compelling for long-term holders.” “One enduring lesson I’ve learned from navigating crypto markets over the last decade is that transformative ecosystem shifts often unfold during periods of apparent quiet,” Kerbage wrote in an August 27 note to investors. “My expectation is that ETH can surpass $10,000 once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for US payments.” Kerbage’s latest note came days after Ether broke a new price record. Until then, the token’s price performance was lacklustre this year compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana. But nowadays, the tide seems to have turned. Fresh regulation surrounding stablecoins, the surge of Ethereum treasuries, “relentless bids” into exchange-traded funds, and the rise of staking yields are driving Ether’s growth. Today, Ether trades at about $4,400, up 83% in the past year. Market watchers are predicting it will trade at $7,500 by years-end, or even at $20,000 at some point in this cycle. Here’s the three reasons why Kerbage sees Ethereum’s price going higher. First, staking. Investors love yield-bearing assets, and Ethereum’s staking model offers exactly that but in crypto form. Nearly 36 million Ether are now staked, according to the Ethereum Foundation, representing nearly one-third of the network’s total supply. “This growth reflects heightened network security and investor confidence, with staking rewards averaging a 2.9% APR, appealing to yield-focused portfolios,” Kerbage noted. Kerbage isn’t the only market watcher who thinks staking will drive a lot of Wall Street interest for Ethereum. For Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, Ethereum is a stronger corporate play than Bitcoin. “Investors will lean into Ethereum not just so that it can appreciate in price alone, but because someone is doing something with that to generate yield,” Park said. Institutions have been pouring in, with ETFs now holding $24 billion in Ether, according to Coinglass. Some analysts predict large entities will hold 10% of the total supply. Tokenisation is the second driver behind the price, Kerbage said. The tokenisation of real-world assets on Ethereum has blown past projections, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 — up from just $5 billion in 2022. Moreover, Bank of America forecasts the market will hit $16 trillion over the next five to 15 years. At current growth rates, however, that timeline looks conservative. “That vision is materialising faster than anticipated,” wrote Kerbage. Value stored in RWAs sits just above $15 billion, according to DefiLlama, with Ethereum accounting for $11 billion. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called tokenisation a potential finance revolution in 2023, reiterated his bullish stance this year, wrote Kerbage. His firm’s own tokenised fund, BUIDL, is the largest in the sector, with $2.2 billion. Kerbage expects the Genius Act to bring even more froth to the sector, as “stablecoins are set to boom.” In third place, there’s the youngsters. Over 50% of Gen Z now owns crypto, with $100 trillion set to move from older to younger generations over the next two decades. “This shift mirrors historical tech adoption — credit cards in the 1990s or the internet’s rise,” Kerbage observed. “Skepticism from older cohorts persists, but a decade into its existence and Ethereum’s utility is undeniable, much like how we now can’t imagine life without smartphones.” Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ørsted sues Trump administration for halting $1.5bn offshore wind project
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/04/orsted-sues-trump-administration-for-halting-15bn-offshore-wind-project/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T15:37:53Z
Full Content:
Ørsted has taken legal action against US president Donald Trump’s administration in an effort to restart work on a nearly completed offshore wind project halted by the US government last month. The troubled Danish renewable energy company is seeking a court order that would let it finish its $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion) Revolution Wind project, which was meant to supply enough power for 350,000 homes in north-eastern US. But the US move to halt the development, driven by Mr Trump’s deep scepticism about wind power, has hit Ørsted’s business and sent its shares to record lows. Ørsted said in the court filing on Thursday that the stop-work order was “arbitrary and capricious” after the company and its partners had spent billions of dollars on approvals. It is one of a series of orders issued by the Trump administration aimed at blocking new offshore wind projects, which the president has described as the “scam of the century”. The Ørsted lawsuit comes a day before the company holds an emergency shareholder meeting in Copenhagen aimed at approving a 60 billion Danish krone (€8 billion) rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet, which has been badly damaged by the Trump administration’s repeated attacks on the industry. Ørsted shares are down 38 per cent this year to DKr199 on Thursday. The Danish state and Equinor, Ørsted’s two-largest shareholders with 50 per cent and 10 per cent stakes respectively, have backed the rights issue, as has Norway’s $2 trillion oil fund, which owns 3 per cent. Equinor has itself sued the Trump administration over a stop-work order on its own Empire Wind project. It later dropped the action after the US lifted the order as New York’s governor opened up for more gas pipeline capacity. Norway mustered a big diplomatic push over the affair, including using Jens Stoltenberg, a former head of Nato who is now the country’s finance minister. But Denmark is more exposed as it is already in a major diplomatic stand-off with the US over Trump’s insistence that he can gain control over the Arctic island of Greenland from Copenhagen. While Ørsted executives and Danish officials have tried to work out what Trump might require to restart Revolution Wind, which is 80 per cent complete, they and the wider industry have become increasingly fearful that the US administration is ready to intensify its attacks. Court filings issued in the US in recent weeks show the administration is working to withdraw permits from at least two wind farm developments off the coast of Massachusetts. These are SouthCoast Wind, being developed by France’s Engie and EDP Renewables, and the New England Wind 1 and 2 projects being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. Ørsted has a second unfinished project in the US, Sunrise Wind, and some investors worry it could also become a target. The Danish group owns a 50 per cent stake in Revolution Wind, the rest being owned by a unit of BlackRock, but it owns 100 per cent of Sunrise, and its difficulties in selling down that stake are what led to the rights issue. Doug Burgum, US secretary of the interior, has defended the suspension of work on Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns, including the possibility that undersea drone attacks could be launched through a wind farm. “People with bad ulterior motives against the US would launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm. The radar gets very distorted,” he said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/dutch-pension-pzfw-terminates-blackrock-aqr-lg-mandates-amidst-portfolio-reshuffle/

The Dutch pension fund for the health care industry, Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzij, known as PFZW, has terminated BlackRock Inc., AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management as equity managers. “PFZW has been developing a new investment strategy where financial performance, risk and sustainability are weighed equally within the framework of a total portfolio approach,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. Spokespeople for the fund told Dutch publication NRC that the fund removed thousands of companies in which it had invested as it makes a switch from a largely index-based passive equity portfolio to an actively managed one, in order to gain more insights into and influence over the companies in which it invests. The fund will continue to use several managers across its 50-billion-euro ($58.37 billion) equity portfolio, including internal asset manager PGGM, Lazard, UBS, M&G, Robeco, Man Numeric, Acadian and Schroders. PFZW completed the selection process for its external managers in the first half of 2024 and began executing mandates in January. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “We have appointed external managers whom we believe are best positioned to carry out PFZW’s assignment under the Investment Policy 2030: delivering market-based returns for a good pension, with an appropriate risk profile and a desired level of sustainability,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. PZFW, which manages 247 billion euros in assets, will continue to invest with BlackRock through a money market fund. “BlackRock clients—including our Dutch clients—continue to invest through BlackRock to meet their sustainable investing goals, entrusting us to manage over $1 trillion in sustainable and transition assets on their behalf,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said. The spokesperson said the firm noted PFZW’s redemption in the first half of the year. NRC reported that PFZW’s discussions with American asset managers on the topic of sustainability became difficult, and firms did not want to face pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump, one increasingly hostile to such investing initiatives. The publication noted these managers were also more hesitant to vote shareholder proxies in favor of sustainability resolutions at shareholder meetings. “PFZW have always voted their portfolio with BlackRock themselves,” the BlackRock spokesperson said. “For eligible clients who wish to participate in the stewardship of their assets, we have built the industry’s largest voting choice program, as well as a climate and decarbonization stewardship program for those clients who choose to prioritize those investment outcomes.” A spokesperson for L&G emphasized its sustainability bona fides. “L&G is a committed global leader in responsible investment,” the spokesperson said. “It is central to the way we drive long-term value creation for our clients, which is why we incorporate it into our investment decisions and stewardship activities. This includes our ongoing work with clients like PGGM, where our relationship remains as strong as ever across asset classes including in other sustainable investment strategies.” Under the Dutch Pensions Act, pension funds in the Netherlands are required to report how their investment policies consider environmental, social and governance factors. BlackRock faces criticism from both proponents and opponents of sustainable and responsible investing, and the $11 trillion asset manager has become a target both as a firm not doing enough to support sustainable initiatives and as one pushing a climate-focused agenda. Earlier this year, BlackRock and several other asset managers left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions among its members. BlackRock’s exit was one of the last before the initiative was frozen. As a result, Dutch pension fund PME Pensioenfonds announced it would review the 5 billion euros it had invested with BlackRock. The pension fund has stated that a decision about its continued work with the manager would be made this year. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s one-time membership in NZAM and similar initiatives was a sufficient reason for some state and federal U.S. lawmakers and asset owners to put the asset manager on notice or divest from it completely. The Texas comptroller’s office, in June, removed BlackRock from a list of companies alleged to boycott the oil and gas industry. BlackRock was also named in a multi-state lawsuit, along with State Street and Vanguard, alleging the trio conspired to suppress the coal market. The Indiana Public Retirement System terminated BlackRock as a fixed-income manager in December 2024 to follow state law after it was determined asset manager had ESG commitments—despite INPRS staff noting no concerns with the performance of BlackRock’s fixed-income strategy.

Title: BlackRock details a trade designed to capitalize on a US dollar that will stay historically weak for years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-to-benefit-from-weaker-us-dollar-blackrock-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-04T13:58:21Z

Stocks outside the US have been big winners this year as factors like tariffs, rate cuts, growing government debt, and a decline in investor confidence have weakened the US dollar. BlackRock says the trend is likely just getting started. "We believe we are toward the beginning of a weaker dollar cycle, which has tended to boost international returns — potentially indicating a structural relationship change that requires investors to consider evolving portfolio construction," the firm said in an August 29 report authored by Gargi Pal Chaudhuri and Kristy Akullian. The continued: "The dollar has long benefited from a cycle of robust US growth and investment. But we think the structural bull market may be challenged amid current trade policy and demand for alternative reserve currencies." The numbers support this view. Dollar weakening cycles since the 1970s have lasted an average of eight years, the firm said. The current cycle is less than three years old. As for how to invest around the trend, the firm said that "unhedged international equities may stand to benefit the most from ongoing currency weakness." Investing in unhedged international stocks means having exposure to them in their local currencies. That way, if that currency rises relative to the dollar, your total return in dollars is larger. On the other hand, if the foreign currency falls relative to the dollar, it eats into your total returns. Investors can choose to hedge their investments in foreign stocks, which takes the currency volatility out of the equation. BlackRock has multiple unhedged international stock ETFs, like the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS). Other examples include the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Data shows investors are still overconcentrated in US stocks, BlackRock said. "The average advisor allocates 77.5% of their equity portfolio to the US, up from 70% in 2018," the firm said. But money is starting to move overseas, with the portion of ETF inflows going to international funds up to 29% from 12% in August last year. That has coincided with strong performance in overseas stocks. IXUS is up 20% in 2025 compared to the S&P 500's 9%. A Bank of America survey of fund managers earlier this year showed that 54% of the group thinks international stocks will be the best-performing trade over the next five years. In the case of a recession, BlackRock said that international stocks may be a better portfolio diversifier than US small-caps, which are subject to the same macro forces that large-cap US firms are. "Lower correlation and corporate reforms in certain parts of the world suggest that most investors could benefit unconditionally from owning more international stocks and seeking alpha in international markets as well as the U.S. markets," said Phil Hodges, co-lead of the Systematic Equities Macro Group at BlackRock, in a quote included in the report.

September 04, 2025 09:30 ET | Source: HRB Tax Group, Inc. HRB Tax Group, Inc. KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In response to the growing number of Americans struggling with financial health, Spruce, the mobile banking app built by H&R Block,1 announced today the launch of its Saving Surge Sweepstakes2. Saving Surge is a six-month initiative designed to reward and encourage consistent saving habits while giving people the chance to win their piece of nearly $5,000. With 70% of Americans identified as financially coping or vulnerable by the Financial Health Network,3 there is a clear need for innovative tools that help make money management simple and effective. Organized in partnership with national nonprofit, Commonwealth, which builds financial security and opportunity for financially vulnerable people and pioneered prize-linked savings in the U.S., the Saving Surge Sweepstakes is more than a contest — it is a movement to help Americans take control of their financial futures, starting with saving money. Beginning today through Feb. 28, 2026, Spruce customers can earn up to five entries each month by completing simple saving actions, such as setting up auto-transfers or depositing money in $10 increments into their Spruce Savings Account.

By encouraging small, consistent behaviors, Spruce is helping customers shift their mindset, grow their savings, and build long-term financial confidence. “The team behind Spruce believes that saving money is one of the most important steps toward being financially healthy and growing wealth,” said John Thompson, Vice President of Financial Services, Spruce. “The Saving Surge Sweepstakes offers a fresh, engaging way to show our customers how they can build better saving habits, one deposit at a time.” As part of Spruce’s ongoing commitment to helping customers build long-term financial security, the Saving Surge Sweepstakes complements the easy-to-use features and tools in the Spruce app such as the Watchlist Budget Tracker, and a Savings account plus two Spruce saving goals that can all earn a high-yield 3.50% APY4 (after opting in). These features reinforce positive financial behaviors and help make managing finances simpler and more accessible without the barriers often found on other platforms.

ByPaul Klein, Contributor. A new generation of Islamic founders are building businesses that are highly profitable, anchored in Islamic moral principles and have the potential to help re-define the digital future. Historically, Muslim-majority countries have not produced tech unicorns with the same global impact achieved by entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. Despite representing nearly one-third of the world’s population, there were only about six unicorns across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) versus more than a thousand worldwide in 2023, according to Fast Company Middle East. There are three primary reasons why tech unicorns have been rare in Islamic regions. Promising regional leaders often sell before going global. For example Careem, the “the everything app” for the Middle East was acquired by Uber for $3.1B. And, souq.com, once the Arab world’s largest e-commerce platform, sold to Amazon for $580M in 2017. While Tel Aviv, Dubai, and Cairo are seen as MENA’s leading ecosystems for entrepreneurs, the region still functions as multiple hubs rather than an integrated single market. Founders expanding across MENA and into South or Southeast Asia face a patchwork of languages, consumer behaviors, regulations and a lack of standardized Sharīʿah frameworks. Finally, there is regional tech talent but entrepreneurs are often drawn to markets like the U.S. where access to startup capital, mentors, and exit markets are deeper. There has been an increase in the local concentration of repeat founders and operators but research on immigrant entrepreneurship shows outsized innovation and firm-creation effects outside countries of origin. Despite the challenges, success stories are emerging and show the potential for success at scale. bKash, founded by Kamal Quadir, is a mobile financial service that has become Bangladesh’s first unicorn and has a valuation over $2 billion. GoTo, founded by Nadiem Makarim, is Indonesia's largest digital ecosystem and provides a wide range of services including e-commerce, ride-hailing, food delivery, and financial services. One reason why companies like bKash and GoTo are so successful is that the underlying demand is enormous and access to capital in Islamic regions is growing exponentially. Islamic finance assets reached $4.9 trillion in 2023 and could grow to $7.5 trillion by 2028, according to the ICD-LSEG Islamic Finance Development Report. Samuel Aziz Boubaous, founder of Dubai-based Wealth Consulting, is another entrepreneur that is helping to reframe what Islamic tech leadership can look like. “I want to build something which just inspires the Islamic world overall that they can do great things,” Aziz Boubaous said in a recent interview. His path into finance was unconventional. As a teenager he scaled a fitness-coaching business into millions in revenue before expanding into e-commerce and, eventually, advisory services. The through-line, he says, was discipline, a trait he learned in the fitness business. “If you box and fight and get beaten, then you actually see business problems as not a big problem—because getting a fist in your face and bleeding is still harder than failing in business.” Boxing taught Aziz Boubaous to take the punches; and entrepreneurship has taught him to keep moving. This is a playbook he believes is critically important for young founders: solve real problems (payments, working capital, cross-border trade), build with uncompromising transparency, and scale through collaboration. “If you’re building for others—not just for yourself—people feel it,” he said. “That’s when they trust you with big decisions.” His long-term vision is to create an Islamic bank that is both technologically world-class and spiritually grounded. He sees a profound gap: “Almost one-third of the world’s population is Muslim, but there is no serious financial infrastructure that reflects our values,” he explained. “We don’t have an Elon Musk or Warren Buffett in the Islamic world to inspire young people. I want to build something that shows them they can do great things too.” For Aziz Boubaous, a global Islamic bank is about more than just financial services, it is also about demonstrating what’s possible when business rigour is combined with moral purpose. His approach is rooted in years of solving banking, payment processing, and corporate structuring challenges for high-growth entrepreneurs. Aziz Boubaous calls his model “private processing”, a hybrid that fuses modern fintech and AI with the human connection of traditional banking. “When you combine old school support with modern technology, it has more value than ever before,” he said. He also grounds his work in Quranic principles such as intention, steadfastness, and uprightness. “Clients send millions through our platforms because they know we have the right intention,” he noted, emphasizing that spiritual grounding creates not only trust but also a competitive advantage. Ultimately, Aziz Boubaous envisions his Islamic bank as a catalyst for what he calls a “digital golden age.” “In Islam we had a golden age where science and business flourished but still with the right values. Now the future is digital—and I believe we can build a digital golden age, not digital destruction,” he said. By creating a financial institution that is both profitable and righteous, Aziz Boubaous hopes to inspire a generation of Muslim entrepreneurs to pursue global ambitions. “Maybe I won’t build the next BlackRock, but I can build something with positive influence and the right values,” he added Aziz Boubaous’ journey reflects more than just individual ambition; it underscores the untapped potential in Muslim-majority regions. Despite their vast populations, increasing youth population, and growing consumer markets, these regions have yet to produce a meaningful number of global tech unicorns. Aziz Boubaous argues this is not due to a lack of talent or ideas, but a lack of infrastructure and role models. “The IQ is not lower, the talent is not less—but the pathways are not as clear as in Silicon Valley or Wall Street.” His vision for a world-class Islamic bank is, at its core, about creating that missing pathway. An increase in tech unicorns could inspire confidence, channel capital into innovation, and provide young Muslim entrepreneurs with the kind of ecosystem that is fuelling tech breakthroughs elsewhere in the world. “By anchoring growth in both technology and values, the Islamic world can finally cultivate its own generation of unicorns,” said Aziz Boubaous. “Companies that achieve billion-dollar valuations and also serve as catalysts for a broader cultural and economic transformation.” Founders like Aziz Boubaous, Quadir, and Makarim are helping to redefine what tech entrepreneurship looks like. An increase in tech unicorns from Muslim countries may send a signal to the rest of the world that Islamic founders have found a way to lead the digital future.

Title: Ray Dalio says ‘most people are silent’ because they’re afraid to talk about what’s really happening with the U.S. economy
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/04/ray-dalio-most-people-silent-afraid-to-talk-about-economy/

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has delivered a stark warning about the state of American discourse around the nation’s economic challenges, saying fear of retaliation, particularly from the Trump administration, is keeping investors and business leaders from voicing critical concerns about the country’s fiscal trajectory. The founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund with approximately $130 billion under management, told the Financial Times that the current political and economic environment resembles the troubling dynamics of the 1930s and 1940s. “Most people are silent because they are afraid of retaliation if they criticize,” Dalio said, highlighting what he sees as a dangerous suppression of economic debate at a critical juncture for the United States. Dalio’s concerns carry significant weight in financial circles. The 76-year-old investor built Bridgewater from his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment in 1975, growing it into a financial powerhouse that manages money for institutional clients including foreign governments, central banks, pension funds, and university endowments. His investment philosophy, based on analyzing cause-and-effect relationships throughout economic history, has earned him recognition as one of the most successful hedge fund managers ever. The Harvard Business School graduate’s track record includes successfully navigating major economic crises, including turning a profit during the 1987 stock market crash. His books on economic principles and market cycles have become essential reading for institutional investors, lending credibility to his current warnings about America’s fiscal health. Dalio’s alarm centers on what he describes as an impending “debt-induced heart attack in the relatively near future,” which he said could strike the U.S. economy within the next three years. The numbers support his concern: America’s national debt has reached a staggering $37 trillion as of August, representing approximately 124% of the nation’s gross domestic product—levels not seen since World War II. More troubling, the Congressional Budget Office projects the debt-to-GDP ratio will climb from 100% in 2025 to 156% by 2055 if current policies remain unchanged. Interest payments on this debt are consuming an increasingly large share of the federal budget, creating what Dalio likens to “a circulatory system riddled with plaque.” Adding to Dalio’s concerns is the current administration’s approach to Federal Reserve independence. President Trump has openly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and attempted to remove Governor Lisa Cook, moves that European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently warned could pose “very serious danger” to the global economy. Dalio specifically cited the government’s decision to acquire a significant stake in chipmaker Intel as an example of increasing state intervention in the economy, describing it as part of “strong autocratic leadership” aimed at controlling financial circumstances. Such interventions, he argued, reflect a broader shift toward the kind of economic authoritarianism that characterized much of the world during the 1930s and 1940s. The immediate economic landscape presents a complex picture that may be masking deeper structural problems. Inflation has moderated to 2.7% as of July, down from pandemic highs but still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Unemployment remains relatively low at 4.2%, though recent job growth has slowed significantly with only 73,000 positions added in July—the weakest performance in months. The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index has declined for six consecutive months through July, signaling potential economic weakening ahead. Real GDP growth is projected at just 1.6% for 2025, slower than historical averages and reflecting the drag from higher interest rates and trade tensions. Dalio’s warning about widespread silence among business leaders and investors reflects what many see as a chilling effect on economic discourse. The fear of political or economic retaliation, he suggests, is preventing the kind of frank discussion needed to address America’s fiscal challenges before they reach a crisis point. This dynamic becomes particularly dangerous when considering that previous debt crises have often emerged suddenly when investor confidence erodes. Dalio pointed to the 2022 experience of British Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked markets so severely that the pound plummeted to historic lows against the dollar, forcing her resignation. As the U.S. approaches what could be a critical period for its fiscal health, Dalio’s warnings serve as a reminder that economic stability often depends on the willingness of leaders—both political and financial—to engage in difficult conversations about unsustainable trends. Whether his prediction of a “debt-induced heart attack” proves accurate may ultimately depend on breaking through the silence he describes. To be clear, Dalio isn’t the first prominent financial leader to warn about the silencing effects of the current political climate. In April, Citadel’s billionaire founder and CEO Ken Griffin said “shame on this administration” after Trump lashed out at Walmart after its CEO raised concerns about tariffs. Similarly, during an interview at the Economic Club of New York earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said most of the CEOs he meets with privately believe the U.S. is in a recession but won’t say so on the record, fearing political backlash and market repercussions. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Proposed Minnesota Power sale to BlackRock rouses concern

Sponsored By ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT DULUTH — As a potential sale of Minnesota Power looms, a crowd of concerned citizens gathered at the company’s doorstep Wednesday afternoon to voice their concerns. On Sept. 25, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is expected to begin weighing whether to approve a $6.2 billion purchase of the Duluth-based utility by BlackRock Global Infrastructure Partners with help from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. ADVERTISEMENT Jenna Yeakle, a Sierra Club staff member, told crowd members Wednesday: “I’m here with you all today to push back against this story that we have been told by Minnesota Power and their potential buyers that they need to be scooped up by BlackRock in order to achieve a carbon-free energy picture." To the contrary, Yeakle suggested the acquisition “could slow much-needed climate action and actually threaten our democracy.” But the utility would really benefit from some outside support to achieve its reduced-emission goals, according to Jen Cady, vice president of regulatory affairs for Allete Inc., Minnesota Power’s parent company. “The scale of what’s in front of us is really unlike anything the company has had to navigate in the past,” she said. Cady noted that Minnesota Power expects it will need to spend $5 billion in the next five years — a sum greater than it has had to raise in the past 75 years. “And these are the right partners to help us navigate that future,” she said. Cady also pointed out that Minnesota Power will continue to be governed by the state PUC and will need to justify any proposed future rate increases, regardless of its ownership. ADVERTISEMENT But Buddy Robinson, a member of the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota who addressed the crowd as an individual Minnesota Power ratepayer, advised that the state PUC pay heed to a July 15 recommendation by an administrative law judge suggesting the acquisition should be blocked for not being in the public interest. “The key fact established in the proceedings is that BlackRock and CPP, as private equity companies, intend to increase rates faster than would happen otherwise,” he said. Robinson said this is the same reason large customers, including taconite and paper producers, have also lined up against the sale. He said that the economic power of BlackRock “boggles the mind,” with a portfolio of $11 trillion in assets — greater than the gross domestic product of all nations, except the U.S. and China. Angel Dubrow, another concerned customer and landlord, suggested higher electricity costs could drive up housing costs that are already unaffordable for many residents, especially as BlackRock and its partners seek to recoup a $1.5 billion premium they have offered to purchase Allete, above its market valuation at the time of the deal. But Cady predicted the new ownership would bring greater stability to Allete and its subsidiary, Minnesota Power. She noted that the company already is publicly traded on Wall Street, with its value largely determined by investors making quarter-to-quarter financial decisions. “Infrastructure funds and pension funds are inherently long-term investors,” she said. “They are looking to provide stable returns over a long period of time. And that investor expectation is much more closely aligned with the utility business, where we build big infrastructure that serves customers for decades.” ADVERTISEMENT Over the past 16 months, Cady said Allete has listened and worked to address customers’ concerns, signing an agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce that contains about 70 commitments, including a one-year base-rate freeze. Unfortunately, that agreement was signed just before the administrative law judge handed down her recommendation, and Cady suggested a close reading might have changed the outcome. “I don’t think the judge had adequate time to really evaluate all of the components of that settlement before her report was due,” she said, contending that the issues raised were pretty comprehensively covered. Yet, state Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, says her fears have not been allayed. “This proposed sale does affect the entire community,” she said. “The BlackRock Corp. controls trillions of dollars of assets internationally," she said. "So, when they become a 60% majority owner of our electric utility, the financial decisions they’re making — whether they be about business strategy, expansion, compliance with our clean energy laws here in the state of Minnesota, whether they honor union contracts, how they treat their workers, whether they go for a rate increase or how much — all of those decisions are going to also be affected by the forces that are coming down on that corporation from their international interests." McEwen predicted this structure would lead to “an inevitable conflict of interest.” ADVERTISEMENT “It is not always going to be in the financial interests of BlackRock to keep our rates as low as possible, to serve our community the electricity we need,” she said. “That’s not the business they are in. They are in the business of making profit from as many things as possible." ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Title: Coinbase Wallet Shows Massive XRP Cuts, What’s Going On?

Data shows crypto exchange Coinbase has made a surprising shift in its XRP holdings by reducing its stash from more than 780 million XRP to around 200 million in a matter of weeks. According to data from XRPScan, Coinbase’s total XRP holdings have fallen by a massive 69% from its most recent proof of reserve report. Notably, this cutback comes at a time when institutional players like BlackRock are increasingly intertwined with Coinbase’s operations Once the fifth-largest exchange holder of XRP, Coinbase has now slipped to tenth place after reducing its balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This represents a staggering 69% reduction since the second quarter of 2025, with a 57% plunge in just the past month. Such a huge cutback in Coinbase’s XRP holdings within a short period of time can only be attributed to outflows from institutional investors. At the time of writing, Coinbase has 11 cold wallets remaining, each holding 16.5 million XRP tokens. This is a massive fall from early June numbers of 52 cold Coinbase wallets holding a total of 970 million XRP, according to XRPwallets, an XRP commentator account on the social media platform X. Interestingly, XRPwallets also hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. BlackRock is a suspect due to the nature of its recent collaboration with Coinbase. That collaboration, which was announced in early August, was done to allow institutional investors easy access to digital assets directly through Coinbase. Although Bitcoin was initially the focus, the partnership has most likely expanded to XRP due to its growing demand among institutional investors. Right now, all that’s left in Coinbase’s XRP wallets might be mostly XRP held by retail traders. XRPwallets also speculated that other major exchanges, such as Uphold, Binance, and Upbit, could eventually show similar balances, around 200 million XRP each, once Ripple’s distributions move through the system. By their estimates, this would leave about 1 billion XRP across exchanges and another 900 million resting in retail cold wallets. Although the numbers were framed as guesses, they relate to the idea that institutional channels are absorbing XRP, leaving exchanges increasingly as platforms for retail activity. Interestingly, other crypto exchanges like Upbit and Uphold have also seen their XRP holdings fall massively within the same time period as Coinbase. Upbit, for instance, saw its XRP balance fall from 6.03 billion XRP to 5.84 billion XRP. Uphold, on the other hand, saw its XRP balance fall from 1.907 billion XRP to 1.746 billion XRP. XRP is still trading below the $3 resistance level after repeated rejections this month, which has left the crypto’s near-term trajectory in question. Reduced exchange balances often point to decreasing sell pressure, which could help support price stability. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, up by 0.8% in the past 24 hours.
