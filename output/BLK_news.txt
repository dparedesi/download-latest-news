Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. They met at 10 p.m. each weeknight, after class at Columbia University. Sometimes talking over Zoom until 2 AM, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi, Ahmed Lone, and Raj Agrawal talked about what it might mean to walk away from their lives—for a startup. All academics in some form or fashion, the group swapped ideas at the intersection of their research: causal machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AI agents. For Agarwal, the decision wasn’t to be taken lightly. That semester, he’d just started a tenure-track faculty position at Columbia after earning his PhD from MIT—he had an academic career that was taking shape. But he was drawn to the entrepreneurial unknown. “I had to get in the game,” said Agarwal, who’s originally from Singapore. “I was looking around at my peers—for example, at Cartesia and Reflection AI. They’re all super smart, and out here building companies. By DNA, they’re researchers with some commercial instinct. They’re solving really hard technical problems, and continuing to produce research in a very cool package. That felt right. That was my motivation.” From those late-night meetings came Traversal, a startup founded in 2023 that focuses on observability and site reliability engineering (SRE)—helping engineers pinpoint and troubleshoot complex software failures with speed and precision. Troubleshooting is “one of the most complex workflows in software,” said Agarwal, Traversal’s CEO. “It’s why you can have 50 people firefighting in a war room until they find the answer.” Today, Traversal launches from stealth with $48 million in funding from its seed and Series A rounds, Fortune has exclusively learned. Sequoia led the company’s seed round, while Kleiner Perkins led Traversal’s Series A. Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’s NFDG and Hanabi (led by Mike Volpi and Bryan Offutt) are also investors. Traversal—named for both the computer science concept of a graph traversal and the idea of journeying through complex systems—counts among its customers Digital Ocean, Eventbrite, Cloudways, and a number of undisclosed Fortune 100 financial services companies. The company and others like it exist to stop software infrastructure crises and limit downtime. “Imagine you’re having a heart attack right now,” said Agarwal. “That’s the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what happens ten minutes from now, or what your dinner is going to look like. An engineering team has two heart attacks a week, and a debilitating condition. So, you never get time to think about planning ahead and being great.” The bigger the company, the higher the stakes of this problem: Bratin Saha, chief technology and product officer at DigitalOcean, said via email that “the sheer volume and complexity of our cloud infrastructure—serving hundreds of thousands of customers—means that even minor platform incidents can quickly escalate, impacting customer experience and incurring significant costs.” Saha told Fortune that, over six months, Traversal has helped resolve problems 37% faster. Traversal’s traction over the last two years is both a product of this moment in tech, the AI wave—and timeless. “Whenever something new shows up, whether it’s a new trend, new market, new kind of product, or a new kind of technology, guess what? It needs to be monitored,” Sequoia partner Bogomil Balkansky said. “That’s observability. And it needs to be secured, which is security. And that’s why those two domains—observability and security—periodically produce big winners.” Some winners from observability in recent years that Balkansky points out: Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, AppDynamics, and New Relic. For Traversal—which sits at the intersection of observability and AI, and builds on existing observability tools—this means there’s opportunity, especially given that the company’s riding the vibe coding wave. “The amount of code being written was already growing at a staggering rate, and with AI code generation, it’s accelerating like never before,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. “With more code created by AI, there is more surface area to troubleshoot. There is a need for AI to autonomously troubleshoot, mediate and even prevent complex incidents at scale—self-healing codegen.” The academic-to-entrepreneur path that Agarwal and his cofounders now walk is well-trod, from VMware’s Mendel Rosenblum to Databricks’s Ali Ghodsi, and more. And though there’s much they don’t have in common, academic research and startups do share at least one key feature. “Most jobs, you’re at A and you have to get to B, and getting from A to B is really hard,” said Agarwal. “In research, though, you don’t really know where A is and you don’t know where B is. And even if you do know, it’s still very hard to get to—and I loved that. I enjoyed the uncertainty.” ICYMI…Here’s our exclusive on the New York-based health tech startup Tennr, which raised a $101 million Series C at a $605 million valuation to tackle the convoluted web of patient referrals.

Title: Anti-woke lawsuit may unintentionally threaten Trump's coal revival agenda
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/anti-woke-lawsuit-may-unintentionally-threaten-trumps-coal-revival-agenda
Time Published: 2025-06-18T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the Trump administration’s efforts to promote energy independence, countering China’s technological dominance and more on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Recent news about coal company bankruptcies serves as a natural experiment on the clash between various federal and state goals, regulations, litigation, and market realities. It also underscores the importance of having a coherent overarching policy that helps achieve President Donald Trump’s energy agenda. In both of his campaigns, President Trump stated that he would like to see a revival of the U.S. coal industry, which has been decimated over the years. President Trump’s April 2025 executive order (EO) outlines various steps from lifting barriers to coal mining, to classifying the metallurgical coal used in steel production in the "critical minerals" category. While coal has been losing its prominence in electricity generation, both in the U.S. and other developed countries, it still represents one-third of global electricity generation. With the right investments and a drive to make coal more efficient and environmentally friendly, the U.S. can play a prominent role in the future of the global coal industry that includes investment in next-generation technologies to reduce coal’s environmental footprint. In fact, President Trump’s EO underlines "clean" several times and emphasizes "accelerate development of coal technologies." But one integral part of the plan should be to generate enough interest in the private marketplace to fund the necessary investments in the quickly shrinking coal industry. CLIMATE LAWFARE IN BLUE-STATE COURTS COULD HURT US ENERGY CONSUMERS, EXPERT SAYS: 'HUGE EFFECT' There was one well-intentioned, but unexpected hurdle that potentially stood in the way of this goal: up until the last few years, the global push for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targeted the fossil fuel industry broadly and the coal industry specifically. The goal of these ESG policies was concerning for the fossil fuel industry as the push to reduce carbon emissions intensified in board rooms and Democrat-led states. These targets aimed to lower investments in the industry through different means, such as introducing stringent reporting requirements. Many opposed these targets, pointing to energy realities and an increasing global energy demand that required healthy investment in the sector. Since the 180-degree turn in the political arena last November, ESG has gone mute. Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are largely back to focusing on maximizing returns, causing a mass exodus from ESG organizations like Climate Action 100+, the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). However, today we face another threat to much-needed investments in the energy sector – ironically not from those seeking to eliminate fossil fuels, but those claiming to protect them. Citing ESG, Texas led 10 other Republican state attorneys general in an antitrust lawsuit against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, accusing the major asset managers of pressuring coal companies like Peabody Energy and Arch Resources to reduce coal production, effectively driving up energy costs for consumers. If found at fault, these companies – who have been previously accused of boycotting the fossil fuel industry – would be required to divest their holdings in the companies listed in the lawsuit: Peabody Energy, Core Natural Resources, NACCO Industries, Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Vistra Energy, Hallador Energy, Warrior Met Coal, and Black Hills Corporation. This is a result that many green groups could only dream about a year or so ago. By forcing Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street to fully divest from their holdings, the coal industry would lose nearly $18 billion ($17.9B) in capital – severely undermining President Trump’s goal to revive the American coal industry. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There are multiple problems with this litigation: experts have been discussing the reasons behind the quick decline of coal since the early 2010s. Abundant and economical natural gas, renewable energy developments, cheap Chinese steel and, of course, federal and state climate regulations are recognized as major culprits for the decline, not asset managers. In addition, these asset managers named in the suit are all purely passive, minority investors in these companies through index funds. It would be hard to connect the decline in the industry to the management of their investments – which collectively only hold between 8.3% - 34.19% of shares in the coal companies according to the lawsuit. But what this lawsuit will do is to strangle the funds that could be used to modernize and grow the industry, ultimately leading to a lower resource base and higher energy prices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If the markets are an indication of how investors see this litigation, look no further than the stock market following the announcement of President Trump’s own DOJ and FTC filing in support of the lawsuit. On May 22, the share prices of several major coal companies (Peabody, Hallador, and Core Natural Resources) closed in the red despite the overall market ending the day up (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500). This could only hasten the demise of the industry, rather than "reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry" as the President has envisioned. The second Trump administration came in with a goal of secure and abundant energy. Every policy or administrative action should take into consideration how the process and remedies can clash with each other and become a roadblock in the way of achieving this vision. This litigation is a perfect example of how things can end up with unintended consequences.

Title: BlackRock Dumps 14 Funds, Many Being Sustainable Products

The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com BlackRock is clipping more than a dozen mutual funds and ETFs from its lines, about half of which focus on sustainable investing. In most cases, the funds appear to have struggled to attract assets: The majority each represent less than $50 million. In all, they account for $549 million, with nearly half of that in the $254 million BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund, which has been in operation since 1992. The asset management giant filed notices Friday for many of the closures, largely for the sustainable funds. The firm did not offer specific explanations for eliminating any individual funds but stated in an announcement that “as we evolve our platform and launch new strategies, we also constantly assess how our funds are meeting investors’ investment objectives and the evolving needs of our clients.” More than any other asset manager, BlackRock has faced the brunt of campaigns against sustainable investing and ESG, or environmental, social, and governance criteria. Over the past several years, BlackRock has been blacklisted by some states for allegedly boycotting the fossil fuels industry, despite being one of the biggest investors in it. Some of the ire stems from public comments by CEO Larry Fink, who had characterized social and environmental responsibility as necessary causes for asset managers. Recently, though, BlackRock has ended its membership in international climate groups, and it subsequently had investment restrictions lifted in Texas. Currently, the company, as well as Vanguard and State Street, face an antitrust lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican states, including Texas, over climate-related initiatives. The sentiment against ESG may have adversely affected demand for the sustainable products, but it’s unclear how much that factored into the low asset levels and decisions to end the funds. It’s notable that all but one of the funds being shuttered are actively managed, and most are at least four years old, said Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar. “That also reflects the trend that passive is gaining more traction and active strategies are losing ground,” she said. Investors have been pulling money from the company’s US sustainable funds, data from Morningstar Direct show: Still Pretty Big: BlackRock has about $2.8 billion in assets in its sustainable US mutual funds and $55.9 billion in the iShares ETFs, the Morningstar data show. The company is also the dominant player in sustainable investing globally, with much of its assets in institutional strategies, Bioy said. “They’re still providing investment opportunities for investors who want to get exposure to the [energy] transition, but that’s in forms other than mutual funds and ETFs.” ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: What the Israel-Iran Conflict Means for Sector ETFs

ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs tracking energy, aerospace, and defense stocks have wiped out initial losses following the onset of the conflict between Iran and Israel, instead climbing to new highs amid speculation that a prolonged conflict might drive up oil prices and fuel demand for weapons. The attacks and Iran’s retaliatory strikes, which also sent shock waves through Israeli-focused funds and broader markets, have far-reaching implications, with gains and losses expected to amplify the market turmoil of the first half of 2025. Still, some experts maintain that holding is the best strategy and that diversification will continue to keep portfolios afloat, particularly since US Treasury yields have actually risen. “This just adds to the chaos we’ve already had this year,” said Sonu Varghese, a global macro strategist at Carson Group. “How we’re talking to advisors is, ‘Diversification may not have worked for the last 10, 15 years, but it’s really showing its colors now.’” The iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS) — which tracks an index of Israeli firms, including its major banks, and has $272 million in assets under management — fell from $86 to $82 a share Friday afternoon, per NYSE Arca data, but has since rebounded to a high of $86.70. The ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL), which also tracks Israeli companies, saw a similar dip Friday but is now up to a high of $25 a share. Other sector ETFs whipsawing in the aftermath include: Back Away, Bonds: In the wake of the strikes, investors have flocked to so-called safe haven ETFs like those tracking the Japanese yen and the long end of the yield curve (such as bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years). However, a properly diversified portfolio doesn’t just rely on bonds to diversify from stocks, Varghese said, but includes things like gold and managed futures. “There’s a bull case and the bear case, and that’s directly being reflected in our portfolios,” Varghese said. “I’m not saying this was exactly predictable, but our portfolios have been positioned to account for the fact that bonds may not be the best diversifier going forward.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund.

Title: Fidelity, Franklin Prep Solana ETFs with Staking

The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com In the crypto ETF world, there’s a lot at stake. Eight asset managers have filed or refiled Solana ETF trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past several days. The barrage of filings suggest that the regulator has been in talks with the firms about their proposals. Amended documents often indicate that companies are incorporating changes that the SEC wants to see — and the development hints that spot Solana ETFs may be approved relatively soon. “Crypto filings generally see some back-and-forth conversation with the SEC, but it seems like Solana ETFs have a high probability of being approved within the next few months, according to precedent set by previous crypto products,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The recent filings have been updated to allow the proposed Solana ETFs to stake a portion of their shares. Staking, in which owners pledge tokens that are used to help secure the network, allows owners to get rewards in the form of more Solana. While the SEC recently expressed concerns with a pair of proposed Ethereum and Solana ETFs that would use staking, the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance has also commented that staking does not amount to a securities offering under the Securities Act of 1933. The proposed Solana ETFs come from a variety of issuers: Stake Through the Heart: “Ethereum ETFs were denied staking when they were first launched, but since then have filed for staking approval,” Islam said. “While the SEC has not yet approved staking for Ethereum ETFs, it’s possible it could potentially be approved alongside Solana ETFs.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund.

Title: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Expects $1,000,000 Bitcoin Price Due to These Two Catalysts

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicts Bitcoin (BTC) will one day be worth a whopping $1 million for two main reasons. In a new interview on the Schwab Network, Novogratz says Bitcoin will eventually increase 850% from its current value due to increased adoption and a weakening US dollar. “The price moves on two metrics. One is adoption, more and more people being introduced to it. We call it orange pilling them. Somebody orange pilled Larry Fink, that was a big deal, because now he got all BlackRock engaged. In Invesco, our partners engaged, and more and more financial institutions are engaged. The other is the macro backdrop, which I think continues to be government spending too much money.” He also believes that younger generations will prefer investing in the top crypto asset over gold, which would send Bitcoin higher. “And so how do I think Bitcoin can go to a million? Well, gold is roughly a $20 trillion asset, and Bitcoin is roughly a $2 trillion asset. We had Warren Buffett retire. Charlie Munger passed away. They didn’t like Bitcoin. They’re not Bitcoin people, but I bet you their grandkids are right. Kids like digital stuff. And as we have this wealth transfer from baby boomers, who are all, rest their souls, going to slowly pass away and that money gets passed down, they’re going to be more willing to buy Bitcoin than gold.” Novogratz previously said Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. Bitcoin is trading for $105,270 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ethereum whale activity at 6-year peak – Is $2,650 ETH’s next stop?

With inflows not seen since 2017 and Wall Street stepping in, Ethereum may be primed for more. Ethereum [ETH] is staging a comeback, and the whales are leading the charge. On the 12th of June, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH added over 871,000 ETH in a single day, marking the largest daily net inflow to these addresses since 2017. This aggressive accumulation spree comes amid reports that BlackRock has scooped up $15.46 million worth of ETH, showing institutional confidence in the asset. With both whales and Wall Street piling in, Ethereum’s next chapter may be closer than the market thinks. For six consecutive days, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have absorbed over 800,000 ETH daily; a level of sustained buying not seen since the 2017 bull run. Source: Glassnode The surge peaked with a record-breaking 871,000 ETH added in a single day, according to Glassnode. As the chart shows, this aggressive accumulation has pushed total holdings in these mid-tier whale addresses above 14.3 million ETH, showing a sharp reversal from earlier outflows. The scale and consistency of this buying spree point to a strong resurgence of long-term confidence in Ethereum. Source: X Ethereum’s accumulation wave isn’t just retail-driven – it now has Wall Street behind it! On-chain data reveals that BlackRock purchased $15.46 million worth of ETH via Coinbase Prime; a rare direct allocation to Ethereum amid a broader surge in accumulator address activity. Source: CryptoQuant As highlighted in CryptoQuant’s chart, inflows into long-term holding addresses have exploded to all-time highs, just as ETH price begins to stabilize above $2,500. ETH showed resilience just above the $2,500 mark, with price action holding steady near the 200-day EMA and the 50-day EMA at press time. This convergence zone is acting as a strong support base. Source: TradingView ETH has shown resilience despite recent dips, rebounding from intraday lows as buyers step back in. At press time, the RSI stood at 48.9—technically neutral but tilting slightly bearish—indicating potential for upward movement if momentum improves. With whale accumulation and institutional interest gaining traction, a move toward the $2,600–$2,650 range looks achievable, provided ETH holds support above $2,500. Conversely, a drop below $2,435 could open the door to further downside risk.

Title: Legal experts and economists sound the alarm over the EU’s sustainability rules rollback
URL: https://fortune.com/europe/2025/06/18/legal-experts-economists-sound-alarm-over-eu-sustainability-rules-rollback-ingka-maersk-unilever/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T06:29:00Z
Full Content:
Dozens of legal scholars and economists have issued stark warnings over attempts by the European Commission (EC) to weaken corporate accountability laws, saying the action will wreck corporate accountability commitments, slash human rights and environmental protections, and lead to higher costs for companies and society. Under pressure from corporate lobbyists, the EC has been discussing reshaping rules that govern how companies monitor and report their activity. Last month, both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz escalated their campaign against the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which covers firms’ supply chains, claiming that the regulations threatened to make European businesses uncompetitive. In a speech, Macron told business executives the CSDDD should be “put off the table” entirely, expressing support for an EC “Omnibus Simplification Package” that would eliminate requirements for companies to monitor their supply chains for violations, remove mandatory climate transition plans, and significantly weaken enforcement mechanisms including civil liability provisions. But legal and economics scholars, environmental organizations and businesses, along with countries such as Sweden and Denmark, have united to defend the regulations. “The members of the European Parliament shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that if they remove this article that that’s going to somehow amount to a reduction in regulatory burden,” said Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, and the founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme. “What will come in its place is a very litigious landscape and differential implementation of national requirements. You will have replaced a nicely uniform obligation with a patchwork of a variety of different and uncertain obligations.” In May, Wetzer and more than 30 other legal scholars sent a letter to the EC warning that, far from reducing costs, scrapping the regulations would create a range of new financial and legal risks for companies, as well as making it harder for them to achieve their sustainability and climate goals. The scholars warn that, “Without guiding regulations, corporate climate transitions will be more disorderly and costly.” Furthermore, Wetzer notes, many European companies have already taken steps to comply with the regulations. Indeed, towards the beginning of the year, 11 major brands, including the likes of IKEA [F500E #85, as Ingka], Maersk [F500E #70] and Unilever [F500E #49] came out in support of the CSDDD, signing an open letter that stated: “Investment and competitiveness are founded on policy certainty and legal predictability. The announcement that the European Commission will bring forward an ‘omnibus’ initiative that could include revisiting existing legislation risks undermining both of these.” “Businesses have already started to put in place reporting frameworks to be able to align with the regulatory package,” Wetzer told Fortune. “There has been a lot of investment in the regulatory architecture on the assumption that this would stay in place for a long time. If you change this regulation and you go beyond simplification, you run the risk that all of those investments go down the drain.” Legal scholars aren’t the only experts to have sounded the alarm on the EC’s plans. Also in May, more than 90 prominent economists criticized Omnibus proposals, strongly refuting claims that the sustainability regulations harm European competitiveness. Instead, they point to other factors behind Europe’s economic challenges, including the energy price crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, declining global demand, wage stagnation, and chronic underinvestment in public infrastructure. The economists’ statement emphasizes that implementation costs for sustainability regulations are minimal, citing a London School of Economics study that estimated compliance costs for large companies at just 0.009% of revenue. They argue that the benefits of the regulations far outweigh such modest expenses, and further note that, with an estimated €750 billion investment gap in sustainable initiatives, the weakening of sustainability reporting requirements could undermine crucial programs like the Clean Industrial Deal and discourage private investment in sustainable projects. “Economic choices are political choices,” said Johannes Jäger, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.” To this point, many critics of the Omnibus package have framed it as opportunistic, saying it is an attempt to both mimic and placate U.S. President Donald Trump who, whilst threatening Europe with tariffs, is carrying out a program of sweeping deregulation across America. U.S. companies have been at the forefront of lobbying efforts to undermine the CSDDD, with watchdogs claiming that investment giant BlackRock helped carve out exemptions from the directive for large financial firms. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.”Johannes Jäger, professor, University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna Such actions have motivated other European finance leaders to rally around the CSDDD. In February, more than 200 financial institutions, representing $7.6 trillion in assets under management, urged the EC to maintain strong sustainability standards. Aleksandra Palinska, executive director at the European Sustainable Investment Forum, warned that the Omnibus would “limit investor access to comparable and reliable sustainability data and impair their ability to scale-up investments for industrial decarbonisation.” Rather than following Trump and doubling down on deregulation, European finance experts have urged the EU to maintain its resolve, along with its reputation for probity. In January, François Gemenne, a professor at HEC Paris and a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said that “the best response to the policies implemented in the U.S. is to beef up the EU green agenda, not to weaken it. Rather than follow Trump’s way, we should design our own path.” Wetzer agreed, saying that the Omnibus proposals harm the European Union’s standing as a rational actor. “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds,” he said. In turbulent times, he suggested, a strong stabilizing influence is required. “We should chart our own course based on our assessment of the fundamentals.” But beyond the legal and economic impacts, it is the environmental and human rights implications of the EC’s proposed changes that have drawn the most fire. In March, more than 360 global NGOs and civil society groups issued a joint statement against the Omnibus, stating that EC President Ursula von der Leyen was “deprioritizing human rights, workers’ rights and environmental protections for the sake of dangerous deregulation.” “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds…”Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance, University of Oxford and founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme In comments accompanying the letter, Marion Lupin, policy officer for the European Coalition for Corporate Justice, said: “The message from Brussels couldn’t be clearer: industry interests come first, while people and the planet are left behind … hundreds of civil society organisations around the world are standing up—no to deregulation, no to greenwashing, and no to this reckless rollback of corporate accountability.” As the Omnibus proposal moves through the European Parliament, the key question is whether EU institutions will preserve their original ambition to guide Europe through its sustainability transition, or acquiesce to corporate lobbying power. The outcome will likely have far-reaching implications for corporate accountability, human rights, and the fight against climate change. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: They walk among us

Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, arrives at the G7. 2025. Image: Number 10 / Creative Commons 2.0. The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. We hoped against hope that the new British government – one that trumpeted its ‘green’ aspirations, the “gift of kindness,” and a firm commitment to human rights – would break free from the malign influence of oil-funded Tufton Street lobbyists, arms manufacturers, and the billionaire press. But even though the faces have changed our hopes have been cruelly dashed. Right from the off it became apparent that Sir Keir Starmer's government is in thrall of the same dark forces. They still walk among us! Peaceful Labour’s duel tragedy is that, far from keeping its promise to oversee a decade of national renewal, putting “service before politics”, its government has broken promises both on the environment and to uphold ancient rights of freedom of assembly. The Exxon-funded Tufton St think tank Policy Exchange is infamous for having composed the last Tory manifesto and drafting the authoritarian Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) and Public Order Acts in response to peaceful climate activism on behalf of its fossil fuel paymasters. Despite originally opposing the Public Order Act and promises to ‘rectify’ protest legislation, the current government has now backtracked on that promise. Lord Walney has been sacked from his post as a (supposedly) ‘Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption’ for conflicts of interest, and his report, ‘Protecting our Democracy from Coercion: an independent view of political violence and disruption’, shelved. But the draconian Public Order Act remains in place. The so-called Walney 16, climate activists sentenced to up to four years for peaceful protest, remain locked up as political prisoners. Sociopath Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, had argued during the second reading of the PCSC Bill: “It would, I think, be wrong if we ended up with higher sentences for peaceful protest and public nuisance than for stalking. That would be to get the balance wrong.” The High Court ruled in May 2024 that the then Conservative government had indeed acted unlawfully in bringing in the Public Order Act under the provisions of the anti-democratic ‘Henry the Eighth clause’ which Liberty described as “undemocratic, unlawful, and unacceptable.” The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. However, Cooper backtracked after becoming home secretary, opting to appeal against the quashing of the very legislation she once condemned. The Court of Appeal found against the government. The government’s continuation of Conservative rhetoric and frustration at judicial independence on asylum cases was also clear in recent calls to exploit “legal loopholes,” drawing criticism even from the hardline Lady Justice Carr. Another unprincipled U-turn has been ordained by foreign secretary David Lammy. When he was a backbench MP in 2018, he described Donald Trump as a "tyrant" and "a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath.” Consultancy He now discounts his own denunciation as old news. He now says he looks forward to finding “common ground” with Trump. He now wants us to believe that the US president is suddenly "someone that we can build a relationship with in our national interest." This common ground inevitably includes championing the interests of oil at home and overseas. He has invited Shell and BAE Systems into Whitehall diplomatic roles, describing the relationship as "a strong shared endeavour." Peter Mandelson has performed a similar act of obeisance, having called Trump “reckless and dangerous to the world” in 2019 and then after his elevation to ambassador to the court of Trump announcing a “fresh respect for the US president." This volte face likely relates to his time leading the consultancy Global Counsel, which has lobbied the new administration on behalf of Shell and Anglo American. It's efforts have also benefited JP Morgan (which has ploughed $430bn into fossil fuel projects since 2015), Standard Chartered (similarly $71bn), and the Palantir organisation founded and chaired by conservative libertarian Peter Thiel who donated to Donald Trump’s political campaign. Vehicle Before the election, Labour pledged not to grant new oil exploration licences but said existing Conservative-approved projects would remain. However, in 2023, courts ruled the Rosebank and Jackdaw licences unlawful due to regulators’ failure to assess the full climate impact, and both were rescinded. Following the ruling the companies behind these projects, including Equinor (for Rosebank) and CNOOC (for Jackdaw), were invited to reapply for the licences, but with a more thorough evaluation of downstream emissions from the burning of the extracted oil and gas. Dishearteningly, Keir Starmer has signalled that, should the companies reapply and be granted new licences, he would not block them, cynically sidestepping his pledge not to approve new exploration with the excuse that the original licences had been submitted before the election. Starmer had pledged to deliver a green prosperity plan before the Labour Party conference delegates in 2022. “It’s time to write a new chapter of Labour Party history about how we built a fairer, greener, more dynamic Britain by tackling the climate emergency head on and using it to create the jobs, the industries, the opportunities of the future," he said. "And what will it mean for working people? Cheaper bills and higher living standards. Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan is the vehicle through which we will turn Britain’s economy around.” Endorsed This pledge was underpinned by the Cedefop report, ‘Skills in transition – The way to 2035’, which concluded that demand is likely to increase upskilling in sectors such as construction, transportation, waste management, electricity, architecture and engineering as these sectors constitute the starting points for a successful green transition and a bedrock for future prosperity. Even the bad boys of Wall Street, Ernst & Young, has admitted: “Green jobs, which contribute to environmental protection and climate action, are projected to drive economic growth and create new opportunities, potentially boosting GDP while also fostering a sustainable future.” But given the government’s multi-facetted Faustian pact with the oily agents of Thanatos, it was inevitable that the government would drop its £28 billion commitment to a green transition. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, accepted a £10,000 donation from Lord Donoughue, who also bankrolls the climate denying Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. GDP growth is certainly not the solution, but even by their own standards, the government has failed to read the runes. Astonishingly, two months after the election last year, Policy Exchange was welcomed as hosts of a reception at the Labour Party conference and Lisa Nandy endorsed their presence by taking part in a subsequent seminar. Hostility Sam Simons of Stop Polluting Politics has written of the continuing influence of the science denialist think tanks: “It is pressure groups like Policy Exchange and its chums on Tufton Street that should be the target of government scrutiny – not peaceful protestors. "Labour must cut its ties with Policy Exchange and show they truly work for the people, not polluters.” While its Machiavellian maneuvers on behalf of big oil are well-documented, Policy Exchange’s ties to the shadowy Gatestone Institute – a network of disinformation specialists who spread hate and fear of Muslims – reveal even darker intentions. Douglas Murray, who once served on Gatestone's board, openly endorsed extreme nationalism at last year’s National Conservatism conference. He said: “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.” Murray is also associate director of the Henry Jackson Society (HJS). Nafeez Ahmed, a journalist at Byline Times, describes them as “a neocon trojan horse for [...] state-expansionism, state-militarisation, interventionism, rampant market deregulation and privatisation in the interests of Western investors, coupled with anti-Muslim hostility and white supremacism.” Zombies Nevertheless, Robin Simcox, a research fellow at HJS was appointed by the last government as the commissioner for countering extremism, fueling fear of environmental activism when he disingenuously warned that environmental groups would "become increasingly militant and that acts of violence will be the logical end". He is still in post. In January 2021, the Conservative government appointed William Shawcross – an HJS board member – to lead the review of its anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. Amnesty and 16 other groups boycotted it, citing concerns over his perceived anti-Muslim bias and downplaying of far-right threats. It was also revealed that when Shawcross was Charity Commission chairman, he had, through the auspices of Professor Gwythian Prins of the GWPF, approached Christopher Snowdon of the tobacco and oil-funded Institute of Economic Affairs to discuss how such industries might influence public debate without opposition from charities. Shawcross also remains in post at Prevent. Also endorsed by the Labour party by its presence at the 2023 conference was Peter Thiel’s ubiquitous Spy-tech firm Palantir, which created software to support drone strikes and immigration raids. Palantir has since secured a £330m contract to build a central database holding all NHS data. Peter Thiel aligns himself with ‘Dark Enlightenment’ ideologue Curtis Yarvin, endorsing the idea that democracy is incompatible with freedom and likening immigrants to zombies. Misleading Yarvin has written: “Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma.” Thiel also openly supports dismantling social welfare programs that many working Americans depend on, such as Social Security, and opposes nearly all limitations on corporate rights to profit from workers’ labour. Cori Crider, founder of Foxglove, a team of lawyers and tech experts dedicated to fighting for ‘tech justice’ warns: “A firm like [Palantir] has no place being the ‘operating system for the NHS’ – period”. She adds that the company “makes no secret of its desire to keep profiting from war and surveillance”. Democracy For Sale notes that Labour and Wes Streeting have accepted £120,000 from John Armitage, a Policy Exchange trustee with private health ties. Streeting has also spoken as a guest of Policy Exchange twice in the past year. Also welcomed at the 2023 Labour conference was energy company SSE, which, despite accusations of misleading the public over ‘green investments’ sponsored a talk entitled ‘Delivering net zero’, and Cadent Gas which sponsored another greenwashing event: ‘How can the energy sector support customers on the journey to net zero?’ Greased Other previous sponsors, who no doubt expect a return on their investments, include National Gas, which provides infrastructure on behalf of British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, nPower and ScottishPower, and Offshore Energies UK (formerly Oil and Gas UK) which has successfully, lobbied for a rollout of carbon capture infrastructure as a distraction from their core activity: the exploration of offshore gas. In 2023, these fringe events were hosted by the New Statesman. At the time Clive Lewis MP expressed an exasperation undoubtedly felt by those of us who considered the New Statesman a trusted publication of the liberal left. "Why are they accepting sponsorship and funding from some of these ethically and morally questionable corporations?" he told openDemocracy. "People want change under a Labour government" he continued, adding that hosting these companies indicates "the same palms are going to be greased." He concluded: "I think it's entirely possible to be on the side of entrepreneurs…without necessarily having to get into bed with big oil companies, big corporations, or the likes of Palantir – and the Labour Party should be really clear about that." They have failed to be. Corrupted Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, told openDemocracy: “The fossil fuel lobby is no stranger to cosying up with policymakers – they've had a lot of success and made a lot of cash from doing so in the past. "But Labour must not make the same costly mistakes as the Conservatives by giving these self-serving climate-wreckers the opportunity to launder their political reputation. "The next government must have bold policies and a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis, not another one that ends up in the back pocket of polluters and dodgy operators.” Also welcomed into Labour’s inner circle, and in attendance at last year’s conference where his firm hosted a drinks reception, was Iain Anderson, a financial lobbyist who supported Liz Truss and represented climate offenders such as BlackRock and Santander. As reported by openDemocracy one Labour MP said: “The British state has been corrupted by big money. It would appear that whoever is in Downing Street, bankers and business leaders call the shots. Suspend "The Tories lost the trust of the British public in no small part due to their dodgy dealings. If the Labour government isn’t careful it will go the same way. [...] It is a clear conflict of interest for a lobbyist to work in the government.” Just after the election, the Labour party accepted a £4m donation from Quadrature Capital, which has stakes worth more than £135m in fossil fuel companies. “Quadrature’s largest corporate shareholding positions linked to Israel’s war in Gaza is with Palantir Holdings, [...] with more than $72m of shares held in June,” reported open Democracy. The omnipresent Palantir has long-standing contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, including support for fighter programs like the F-35. While David Lammy suspended 30 arms export licences to Israel, he refused to suspend licences related to F-35s. Once again, Palantir had its way. Scandal Since the UK election, it has been clear that the neocons have been buoyed by the election of a fellow traveller in the USA, and with new wind in their sails they have ramped up their incursions into the political mainstream. Both major parties are now pandering to the Reform party’s base and, in doing so, Labour is sacrificing any remnants of socialist principle. The now ubiquitous use by Labour of phrases like ‘tax burden’, ‘taking back control of our borders’ and eco ‘zealots’, straight from the Reform lexicon, is evidence of this drift. Graham Stringer, a Labour MP and also a GWPF trustee, once voted against accepting human-driven climate change and in 2017 told The Independent: “I am sceptical about everything – that is what scientists are. [There] has been an enormous amount of shoddy work masquerading as science with regards to climate change.” Before the election, Carys Boughton of the Fossil Free Parliament campaign group said: “It’s a scandal that Labour is allowing Graham Stringer to stand again. Purge "To keep a forthright, prominent climate denier in the fold is to suggest that the party doesn’t understand the urgency of the crisis we are facing. We need Labour to actively stand against the forces that are compromising good climate policy, be they external or within their own ranks.” Yet Stringer retains the Labour whip. Christopher Chope MP, another GWPF supporter, took up a place on the Energy and Net Zero All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) to influence policy on a green transition. Although he hasn’t declared any formal connection to climate denial groups, cocking a brazen snook at the committee, he recently attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe, a branch of the foremost US climate science denial hub funded by Koch Industries. Bob Ward, the director of communications at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “Heartland no doubt feels emboldened by the prospect of a new Trump administration that is promising to carry out an ideological purge of anything related to climate action.” Emboldened Indeed, the Commons standards committee has, in the past, expressed fears that "hostile foreign actors [could seek to gain] improper access and influence" through the APPGs, and that companies and foreign powers could use APPGs to buy political influence. It is now clear that far from being a new broom, the new administration has continued the Conservative’s symbiotic relationship with lobbyists working on behalf of those whose interests do not include our wellbeing as a nation: the oil industry proxies of Tufton Street, as well as a broader network of far-right ideologues aligned with the resurgent Trump regime. The home office maintains that: “The first duty of the government is to keep citizens safe and the country secure.” The failure of Starmer’s executive to confront these forces, newly emboldened and operating with a sense of impunity, has opened the door to a dark age of authoritarianism and climate precipitated societal collapse. Revolution This essay highlights climate denial and spin—whether as an aspect of government corruption, or how it’s reported. Today’s media ecosystem – across social, corporate, and state platforms – has been captured by a handful of powerful actors: billionaire owners, political fixers, and advertisers. They use this control to advance narrow, often toxic agendas at the expense of truth and public interest. Frustration among those committed to honest reporting has reached boiling point in the UK. The media’s capture by vested interests and a broken regulatory landscape are barriers we must overcome in order to tell and hear objective truth – whether about climate breakdown or the cynically fomented culture wars dominating public discourse on a raft of issues of our times.

Title: Trump Will Delay Enforcing TikTok Ban for a Third Time, White House Says
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-tiktok-ban-delay-enforcing-law-september-1236434958/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by its Chinese owner, ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the ban. But since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued two executive orders delaying enforcement of the law, and now he’s going to give TikTok — which has said it has more than 170 million U.S. users — yet another stay of execution. Popular on Variety Related Stories Las Vegas Studio Proposal Backed by Sony and Warner Bros. Dies in Nevada Legislature Sony Expands Access to Its 360 Virtual Mixing Technology, Making Professional Studio Sound Mobile On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will sign an additional executive order this week “to keep TikTok up and running.” The new deadline to reach a deal keeping TikTok legal is now mid-September. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” Leavitt said in a statement (via CBS News). “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Earlier Tuesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a TikTok deal would probably require approval by China’s government and he said, “I think President Xi will ultimately approve it, yes.” Asked whether he has the legal authority to extend the deadline again, Trump claimed, “Yes, I do.” Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. The law does not permit Trump to postpone its enforcement. But he has done so anyway, as his administration tries to figure out a new structure for TikTok in the U.S. that would let it stay legal. The Trump administration reportedly proposed spinning off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law. Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle, Blackstone and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, which have been reported to be part of the deal talks. Oracle is seen as a logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. But the deal evidently fell apart amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China over Trump’s move to impose steep tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, prior to Trump’s previous deadline, ByteDance said that it was in discussions with U.S. government officials “regarding a potential solution for TikTok U.S.” but that an agreement was not finalized because “there are key matters to be resolved.” ByteDance also said any agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law. After TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, the app briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18. But about 14 hours later, TikTok restored service — citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Meanwhile, Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok in February after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. Trump, during his first term as U.S. president, tried to ban TikTok on national-security grounds but those efforts were shot down by federal courts. Trump joined TikTok in June 2024 during his presidential campaign. At a press conference in December, Trump said, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Ethereum: Here’s why ETH could be set for a bullish move soon

Following major whale purchases last weekend, increased ETH ETF inflows and instituitonal adoption, ETH could be set for a major breakout. Ethereum [ETH] whales (1K-10K ETH holders) have net-accumulated the most ETH they ever did in a single day since 2018. This was a whopping $2.5 billion in ETH absorbed by whales, as shown quite clearly by Glassnode data. This upward sharp spike on the histogram confirmed this record whale net position change. It was a knee-jerk that reflected the same kind of gathering that was witnessed in 2017, right before the significant bull run of Ethereum. The quantity of supply by the whales started gaining swiftly as it moved back past the 14 million ETH level after showing a multi-year decline. Meanwhile, price action of ETH was declining, indicating that the whales were front running retailing in a stealth accumulation play. Source: Merlijn The Trader/X Previous episodes of this kind of accumulation of whales have been followed by a significant bullish run in ETH. In case the pattern maintained the same trend as 2017, then a huge price breakout might be in store. The chart confirmed rising whale conviction, thus, it was possible that low retail action would be followed by the hurricane. A historic step may be in the offing by ETH. Over the past week, Ethereum saw a net inflow of over $450 million into spot ETFs—marking the third-largest weekly inflow since August 2024. This surge reflected a strong wave of institutional buying, reinforcing the idea that quieter market periods often become accumulation phases for banks, institutional investors, and other savvy players. Interestingly, this renewed interest came as ETH’s price hovered near a key support level, even while inflows were rising—a classic sign of bullish divergence. While March and April 2025 were marked by bearish ETF outflows, the tide shifted in May and June with two consecutive weeks of strong inflows. This shift signals growing market confidence and a potential turning point for Ethereum’s momentum. Source: Crypto Rover/X A bullish setup appears to be forming for Ethereum, driven by a notable drop in exchange supply and a surge in inflows. Rather than signaling a market top, these dynamics suggest a consolidation phase that could precede a breakout. Since early 2025, data from Token Terminal has shown a parabolic rise in tokenized assets under management on Ethereum. Major institutions such as BlackRock, PayPal, and Franklin Templeton have contributed to this growth, signaling a significant increase in institutional trust in Ethereum’s infrastructure. Ethereum is increasingly establishing itself as a financial hub, now anchoring over $4 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Historically, strong capital inflows and the rising adoption of RWAs often precede major price revaluations. If this trend continues, Ethereum may be on the verge of a significant breakout.

Title: Timing not right on ESG lawsuits

No one who cares about America’s energy future argues that the big investment firms that withheld capital from the coal industry to meet their Environment-Social-Governance goals deserve condemnation. Their moral preening meant higher energy prices for Americans and a threat to the high-paying jobs and consistent source of energy that the coal industry provides. But the coal industry has received a lifeline, courtesy of President Donald Trump’s Day 1 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which called for an all-of-the-above energy policy that encourages production of all available fuels to meet the fast-growing demand. Now, as these big investment firms are backing off the DEI and ESG policies that harmed the coal industry so much, another threat has materialized. Ken Paxton of Texas and 10 other GOP state attorneys general have filed a lawsuit against Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard. The suit claims the firms violated federal antitrust law by forcing the coal companies to reduce output so the investment firms could meet their ESG goals. The suit contends this amounts to collective influence being used to pressure American coal companies, such as Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, to take actions that reduced their profitability. The suit also calls for the named firms to divest from coal. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, polarized ‘environmental’ agenda,” Paxton said in a release about the lawsuit. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But what if they’ve stopped? What if this actually isn’t much of a problem anymore? What if this lawsuit actually does more harm than good to consumers and President Trump’s energy agenda? Increasingly, voices on the right are saying the answers to these questions, and thus the lawsuit itself, might be problematic. Coal market rigging is so 2024. Blackrock is undertaking an “ongoing review of our global practices” in light of President Trump’s orders on DEI and ESG and “will adapt” to changing laws. It has folded its DEI program into a “Talent and Culture” group and no longer requires managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for each job. Meanwhile, many on the right are concerned the lawsuit could encourage the big investment firms to back out of the coal industry, leaving it starved for funding at a time when America needs its energy the most. “Though I’m generally supportive of ensuring companies are not influencing certain types of energy investments, this lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs would actually force divestment from coal – the opposite of what we want in an “above all” energy market,” wrote George Landrith, president of the free-market think tank Frontiers of Freedom, on X. “Plus these asset managers have openly moved away from ESG, dropping different climate commitments and funds. This suit feels unnecessary and problematic because demand for energy is increasing. To keep up, we need investments in all forms of energy – including coal.” In fact, Landrith wrote, the AGs should reconsider this suit “unless they want to help out the environmentalists that have been pushing for the end of coal for years. To meet POTUS’s goal of American energy dominance, we need fewer political lawsuits & more energy investment.” The heart of these 11 AGs is in the right place. The big investment firms do deserve punishment for limiting the output of these firms that were trying to provide the energy security all Americans depend on – all for radical-left goals that even they don’t adhere to anymore. But the reality is this could scare investment away from coal firms at the time they need it most. If these AGs want to protect America’s energy supply, they will stand down and let the coal industry and its biggest investors settle their own scores. “Thankfully the tide is turning,” wrote Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, on X. “Major institutions are backing away from extreme ESG groups like @NetZeroWatch, @ActOnClimate100 after conservative pressure. And while I support the recent lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs against asset managers pushing green energy, I’m concerned about the suit forcing coal divestment. We need more investment in energy, not less.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of UndermineTreasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu.

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of UndermineTreasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion.

The latest funding comes in addition to a separate $5 billion debt financing plan announced earlier this month. The fundraises underscore Musk’s renewed focus on building out his AI ventures after leaving the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (aka DOGE) in May. Last year, xAI raised $6 billion in a Series B round in May and another $6 billion in a Series C round in December, which included investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, BlackRock, the Qatar Investment Authority, and Kingdom Holding Company. Following the Series C funding round, xAI was valued at $50 billion. In March, xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s social media platform, through an all-stock transaction, granting xAI access to a massive real-time data stream for training its AI systems. At the time of the acquisition, the combined value of xAI and X stood at $113 billion. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 The company has also invested heavily in hardware, building a supercomputer nicknamed Colossus, which is expected to use more than 200,000 GPUs. “This isn’t a hype cycle. It’s a capital regime shift—one where AI isn’t the bubble; it is the system,” Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at the Futurum Group, told Decrypt. “Musk just showed us the going rate to play: $9.3 billion and counting.” While the specifics of the investor composition remain undisclosed, the combined $9.3 billion financing package, comprising both debt and equity, will finance xAI’s expansion into larger data centers and the continued deployment of its flagship chatbot, Grok. According to investor briefings cited by Bloomberg, xAI has already spent the majority of the $14 billion it raised prior to this latest fundraising effort. “This is infrastructure capital—poured into GPUs, training runs, and the bandwidth layer that turns AI hype into functionality,” Boloor added. “Musk isn’t building an app; he’s buying the base layer. And he’s betting that whoever controls computing power controls the future.” xAI did not respond to Decrypt's requests for comment.

Family offices are reportedly investing a lot more in a certain type of alternative investment amid global uncertainty, according to the biggest asset manager in the world. Private credit is emerging as a top alternative asset for family offices, according to a new survey by BlackRock, reports Bloomberg. Of the 175 family offices around the world that were surveyed, more than half have a bullish outlook on private credit and nearly one-third say they are planning to increase allocations to the asset class this year. Says Armando Senra, head of the Americas institutional business at BlackRock, “They are diversifying their exposure within private markets. While allocations used to be primarily into private equity growth, now what you see is high interest in private credit, the beginning of interest in infrastructure.” The survey also finds that 30% of respondents plan to commit more of their money to the infrastructure market. Lili Forouraghi, BlackRock’s head of family offices, health care, endowments, foundations and official institutions in the US, says the super-rich are increasingly interested in the potential of private credit to generate a higher yield than public bond markets. She also says that infrastructure investments related to decarbonization and “the whole buzz of AI plus data centers, those are the areas that have intrigued a lot of our clients.” The survey finds that, on average, alternative investment comprises 42% of assets in family office portfolios, up from 39% in a prior 2022-2023 survey, and that private credit holdings make up anywhere from 15% to 30% of some family offices’ portfolios.

The round was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, and included new investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Applied Intuition’s raise comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. The company makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions. That includes simulation software and managing data. “When they think like, ‘I have this software or AI problem,’ we generally want them to think about us,” CEO Qasar Younis told TechCrunch last year. “Like we want to be that first call.” Applied Intuition works with most of the major automakers, as well as autonomous vehicle companies such as Gatik and Kodiak. The company has also increasingly pushed into the defense space. In its newsletter announcing the funding round, Applied Intuition shared that it was asked by the U.S. Army to help bring autonomous tech to some of its vehicles. The company was able to take an infantry squad vehicle from “bare bones” to autonomous in just 10 days. This included developing a “pedal-pushing robot to physically turn the wheel and press the throttle and brake pads.” Correction: This article was updated to include that Applied Intuition closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer.

Title: Cardano Founder Draws Line In The Sand–’I’ll Retire If This Fails’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ill-retire-if-this-fails/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T18:00:09Z

Charles Hoskinson has delivered his sharpest ultimatum yet to the Cardano community, telling viewers of a June 16 white-board livestream that he will “simply retire” if the network rejects his plan to overhaul its 1.7 billion ADA treasury—now worth about US $1.1 billion at the current spot price of roughly $0.64 per ADA—into an actively managed, multi-asset sovereign wealth fund. Hoskinson opened with a stark assessment: the on-chain treasury—about 1.7 billion ADA, worth roughly $680 million at current market prices—remains a “passive, single-asset, unmanaged” pool whose purchasing power collapsed when ADA fell from its 2021 peak near $3 to last year’s $0.25 lows. “If ADA collapses, you lose enormous amounts of your spending power,” he warned, contrasting today’s diminished war-chest with the “almost five billion dollars of buying power” the treasury briefly commanded during the last bull run. Hoskinson’s remedy is the same sovereign-wealth-fund architecture he first floated a week ago, but this time the IOG chief drilled into mechanics—divesting up to 100 million ADA into cash via OTC “iceberging,” redeploying proceeds across Bitcoin, asset-backed and algorithmic stablecoins, and real-world-asset yield strategies, then recycling profits back into ADA or further investments. The structure would sit under a Wyoming DAO that owns an offshore vehicle in BVI or Cayman, employing professional asset managers and subject to an elected, audited governing board. What rendered the session extraordinary—and electrified social channels—was Hoskinson’s tone. He confessed to being “thoroughly tired” of “paralysis analysis” and vitriol on X , declaring: “I’m not going to cuddle people anymore… I’m going to tell you in a frank, adult way what we need to do.” Then came the ultimatum: “Our burden is to submit a governance action and you get to decide. […] It’ll become very clear to me if I share ideas and they don’t get adopted that the ecosystem has lost confidence in my ability to lead, in the ideas that I bring to the table. In which case I don’t provide value to the ecosystem and I’ll just simply retire. If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, well then I’ll stay. If you adopt the ideas and they fail, obviously I have bad ideas. There’s no ego in that. That’s just objective reality. And that’s where we’re at.” Hoskinson further alluded to the recent fraud allegation and the conflict with the Cardano Foundation. Clearly emotional, he continued: “I again wish I could be nicer, but again, rubicons were crossed, things were done, and wounds will never heal because of what’s been said and done. And I am thoroughly tired of the current paralysis analysis that we’re stuck in.” He warned the Cardano community that the ecosystem still has a lot of catching up to do in many areas compared to its competitors, and that this will only be possible with a functional treasury. “We are not the market leader. Even though we enjoy technological superiority, we currently do not have a fully functioning governance superiority, nor do we have the investment momentum necessary to go to number one. Now, with good strategy, good governance, and decisive action, we can grow every year and get into a very strong position. But we have to act.” Hoskinson argued that the proposed fund could “prime the pump” by seeding both Cardano-native stablecoin issuers (USDM, USDA) and Bitcoin DeFi protocols, using treasury-owned BTC to entice liquidity from the world’s largest crypto asset. “The headline that Cardano takes a position in Bitcoin as an ecosystem is a very powerful one,” he said, hinting at cross-chain partnerships and on-chain fee capture that would ultimately flow back to ADA holders. Critics inside Cardano have voiced fears that off-loading nine-figure ADA tranches could crater the token’s price or saddle the DAO with Wall Street-style fees. Hoskinson countered both points. First, he cited OTC liquidity data, noting “billions and billions of dollars of divestments” have already been absorbed during past sell-offs without existential damage. Second, he framed manager fees—“25 to 100 bps”—as standard in an industry that already services MicroStrategy, Grayscale and BlackRock-sized allocations. To insulate the treasury from mismanagement, the DAO’s elected board would control asset-manager mandates, while an independent audit layer would “verify that everything that’s happening in this structure is correct.” A built-in “rip-cord” would allow Cardano Governance to liquidate positions back into ADA if strategies sour. A formal governance action is expected to surface at Rare Evo in Denver this August, giving ADA voters the first opportunity to bless or reject the framework. Hoskinson made it clear that his future rests on the outcome: “If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, then I stay… If not, I’ll retire.” For an ecosystem that has long prided itself on measured, peer-reviewed progress, the founder’s demand for decisive action—and his threat to walk away—marks a pivotal moment. Whether Cardano embraces an active sovereign wealth fund or clings to its passive reserves may dictate not only the chain’s DeFi prospects but also the role Hoskinson plays in the project he created eight years ago. At press time, ADA traded at $0.63. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: [US] Take a Timely Tour Through the Turbulent Timeways

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of Undermine Treasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

Title: Crypto wrap: Ethereum ETFs hit ATH, SPX6900 cools off, XRP outlook remains bullish

Ethereum, XRP, and SPX6900 are moving in different but equally significant directions this week, revealing major developments across the crypto market. The market is showing signs of rotation, and investor attention is quickly shifting among top altcoins as new narratives unfold. While institutional accumulation pushes Ethereum ETFs to an all-time high in on-chain holdings, SPX6900 takes a breather after a parabolic rally, and XRP sustains a bullish tone despite ongoing legal hurdles. Institutional interest in Ethereum has sharply intensified, propelling ETF-related on-chain ETH holdings to their highest levels in history. Recent CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum ETFs now retain close to 4 million ETH, with BlackRock leading a wave of accumulation that has accelerated throughout June. Notably, the ETFs have seen strong accumulation momentum even as the price of Ethereum (ETH) remains largely flat around the $2,500 mark. The spike in inflows, particularly from BlackRock and Grayscale, as depicted by Coinglass data, confirms that large funds are positioning early for a potential ETH rally. This surge in institutional buying comes amid growing optimism in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, supported by increased activity in DeFi and rising stablecoin volumes. The aggressive accumulation further aligns with diminishing exchange reserves and rising staking levels, suggesting that the market is preparing for reduced ETH liquidity and possible upward price pressure. Notably, the inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed Bitcoin ETFs over recent weeks, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment. As inflows continue to dominate daily activity, Ethereum may be setting the tone for the next wave of altcoin momentum. Meanwhile, SPX6900 has cooled off after an extraordinary 230% rally that played out between May and mid-June. The altcoin’s parabolic move took it from $0.50 to nearly retest its all-time high of $1.77 before losing steam around $1.70. The rally, which was initially triggered by a golden cross on May 6, followed a textbook parabolic structure with four accelerating legs and shallow pullbacks. However, a sharp decline in open interest and spot outflows of over $6.4 million on June 14 indicated a decisive shift in sentiment. Although the correction has been intense, technical indicators suggest that SPX6900 is entering a healthy consolidation phase rather than a full breakdown. The RSI has cooled from an overheated 75 to around 40, and the MACD has flipped bearish, signalling that momentum is resetting. Currently trading around $1.39, SPX6900 is holding key support at $1.30. A rebound from this level could see the token test $1.50 again, with a potential retarget of $1.71 if volume returns and sentiment stabilises. While Ethereum and SPX6900 shift gears, XRP continues to attract bullish interest even as its legal battle with the SEC drags on. Notably, a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to pause appeals until August 15 has not dampened optimism in the market. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025.https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 The requested pause is tied to a pending ruling in the Southern District of New York regarding a $125 million escrow and the SEC’s demand for a $50 million penalty. Although the case remains unresolved, XRP derivatives show that traders are staying confident. Open Interest in XRP has climbed above $4 billion, and the positive funding rate suggests that leveraged long positions remain in play. Even though long liquidations have slightly outpaced shorts in the last 24 hours, the market bias remains bullish. From a technical standpoint, XRP recently bounced off the 200-day EMA and is now attempting to reclaim higher levels around the 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.24. If the price manages to close above those barriers, it could test resistance near $2.33, a level aligned with a trendline connecting the year’s previous peaks. Despite the indecisive RSI near 49, MACD indicators are leaning bullish, offering signs of a potential upside continuation if momentum follows through.

UPDATED 12:00 EDT / JUNE 17 2025 by Kyt Dotson Applied Intuition Inc., a startup that develops technology for autonomous vehicles, trucks, drones and other intelligent platforms, today announced it has raised $600 million in late-stage funding, doubling its valuation to $15 billion. The company’s Series F financing was co-led by Blackrock-managed funds and the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. Additional funding came from Kleiner Perkins, Fidelity Management & Research, Lux Capital, BOND, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, Franklin Templeton and almost a half-dozen others. Founded in 2017, Applied Intuition provides a full toolchain of artificial intelligence options for delivering vehicle autonomy from simulation to an operating system called Vehicle OS. The company’s platform combines autonomy, voice, generative AI and developer tools so that any vehicle can make decisions based on environmental conditions. “We envision a world where vehicles do more than move people or goods,” said co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Peter Ludwig. “Whether it’s a car, a military drone or heavy equipment, each becomes an intelligence system that will anticipate needs and protect what matters most.” This funding comes around a year after AI raised $250 million at a $6 billion valuation led by Lux Capital and Elad Gil. More recently, the company entered into a partnership with OpenAI to enhance AI-powered in-vehicle experiences. As part of the deal, OpenAI’s ChatGPT was made available to Applied Intuition employees. Applied Intuition’s platform provides every layer for autonomy and design for consumer, industrial and defense. For consumer development, this means intelligent in-vehicle experiences by adding conversational, multimodal voice assistance and generative AI context-aware interactions inside and outside the vehicle. For enterprise-scale operations, AI assists with massive-scale data and machine learning infrastructure, neural simulation, AI agents and full vehicle testing to develop and validate next-generation automated driving and general vehicle software. In real-world operations, this results in full fleet and operational intelligence for efficient management and safety using real-time data, route optimization and automated reporting. “Vehicle intelligence isn’t just about adding another feature — it’s a fundamental shift. It’s about making vehicles safer, smarter, and more adaptable, and doing it at scale,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Qasar Younis. The company said the capital will help push further into the frontier of vehicle intelligence, especially across the sectors of automotive, commercial defense and off-road. Applied Intuition also said it intends to invest in expanding into new markets, such as the United Kingdom, to bring vehicle intelligence to a broader global audience and support international customers.

Title: Las causas de la incertidumbre económica global

LONDRES – El reciente aumento de los rendimientos de la deuda pública ha obligado a empresarios e inversores de todo el mundo a plantearse una pregunta crucial: ¿las empresas deben endeudarse a las tasas de interés actuales antes de que sigan subiendo? Al mismo tiempo, el incremento de los costos del capital y la persistente volatilidad de los mercados están obligando a los inversores a reevaluar sus carteras. El interrogante se torna cada vez más urgente, ya que el rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense a diez años ha subido 50 puntos básicos, hasta el 4,5%, en menos de un mes. El rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro a 30 años se acerca al 5% tras subir 30 puntos básicos solo en mayo. Más allá de las oscilaciones del mercado a corto plazo, al menos cinco cambios estructurales podrían remodelar el panorama económico mundial, con el potencial de trastocar las estrategias empresariales, erosionar los rendimientos de la inversión y socavar aún más las perspectivas de crecimiento. En primer lugar, el deterioro de la situación fiscal de Estados Unidos. Según las últimas previsiones de la Oficina Presupuestaria del Congreso (CBO por su sigla en inglés), el rendimiento del bono del Tesoro a diez años será del 4,1% en 2025 y bajará al 3,8% para 2035. Pero dado que el rendimiento del bono a diez años ya ronda el 4,5% y se espera que las tasas de interés se mantengan elevadas, el déficit federal podría aumentar mucho más rápidamente de lo previsto. La trayectoria fiscal de Estados Unidos ya es insostenible, y la CBO prevé que el déficit presupuestario federal aumente del 6,2% del PIB en 2025 al 7,3% en 2055. Y lo que es aún más alarmante, el ratio deuda-PIB -que actualmente representa el 124,3% del PIB- podría alcanzar el 156% para 2055 si persisten las tendencias actuales. La segunda causa de incertidumbre tiene que ver con las permutas de riesgo de crédito (CDS por su sigla en inglés), que contribuyeron a alimentar la crisis financiera global de 2007-2008. Desde que Moody's rebajó la calificación crediticia soberana de Estados Unidos de triple A a Aa1 en mayo, el costo de asegurarse contra un impago estadounidense ha aumentado considerablemente, ya que los mercados consideran cada vez más la deuda pública estadounidense como un activo de mayor riesgo. De hecho, los diferenciales de las CDS estadounidenses hoy superan a los de países con una calificación crediticia similar, como el Reino Unido, y cotizan a niveles comparables a los de Grecia e Italia, ambos con calificación BBB. Del mismo modo, asegurar la deuda pública estadounidense cuesta ahora más que asegurar los bonos del gobierno chino, a pesar de que la calificación de China es inferior a A1. Don’t miss our next event, taking place at London Climate Action Week. Register now and watch live on June 23 and 24 as our distinguished panelists discuss how business can fill the global climate-leadership gap. Register Now Un tercer problema es la opacidad de los mercados de crédito privados, lo que representa una vulnerabilidad estructural a largo plazo. BlackRock predice que los activos de crédito privado gestionados se duplicarán con creces hasta alcanzar los 4,5 billones de dólares en 2030. A medida que fluye más capital hacia los mercados privados -tanto de renta variable como de deuda-, la fijación de precios se vuelve menos transparente, lo que dificulta a los inversores la valoración de los activos. La continua expansión de los mercados privados opacos también hace subir el riesgo de que se acumule apalancamiento de forma inadvertida. Gran parte de esta deuda queda fuera del alcance de la supervisión regulatoria, lo que deja a los analistas y a los responsables de las políticas sin los datos necesarios para evaluar o modelar el verdadero alcance del riesgo sistémico. Los mercados de crédito no regulados pueden ser especialmente vulnerables a las quiebras en cascada, mientras que las tasas de interés persistentemente elevadas aumentan el riesgo de impago. Si no se abordan, estas vulnerabilidades podrían provocar dificultades financieras generalizadas y pérdidas de empleo, lo que, en última instancia, desencadenaría una recesión económica. En cuarto lugar, la relación entre el dólar estadounidense y las tasas de interés parece estar cambiando. Históricamente, el aumento de los rendimientos de los bonos ha apoyado un dólar más fuerte, mientras que la caída de los rendimientos tendía a debilitarlo. Sin embargo, desde finales de marzo, los rendimientos de los bonos han subido incluso cuando el dólar ha bajado un 6% frente al euro. Esta divergencia sugiere que los mercados globales están reevaluando la prima por la tenencia de dólares y ahora exigen mayores rendimientos. Las acciones estadounidenses también se han mostrado volátiles, lo que sugiere que la revalorización de las primas de riesgo de los activos denominados en dólares se extiende a los mercados de renta variable. El aumento de los rendimientos reduce el valor de los bonos existentes, lo que indica que los bonos del Tesoro ya no se consideran una cobertura fiable contra las turbulencias bursátiles. Por último, muchos estadounidenses siguen muy expuestos a la renta variable. Según una estimación, las acciones representan más del 70% de los activos financieros de los hogares estadounidenses. Esto hace que el reciente aumento de los rendimientos de los bonos y la mayor incertidumbre económica sean especialmente preocupantes, ya que ambos episodios apuntan a cambios fundamentales en la dinámica del mercado. Los líderes empresariales y los inversores con más probabilidades de éxito en este panorama tan cambiante serán aquellos que entiendan las implicancias de largo alcance de las tendencias económicas y geopolíticas. En un entorno marcado por una creciente incertidumbre, deben estar preparados para ajustar sus carteras y sus estrategias de asignación de capital para tener en cuenta una gama más amplia de riesgos y posibles resultados.

Title: Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025

June 17, 2025 11:27 ET | Source: Northern 2 VCT PLC Northern 2 VCT PLC 17 June 2025 Northern 2 VCT PLCAnnual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 Northern 2 VCT PLC is a Venture Capital Trust (VCT) managed by Mercia Fund Management Limited. It invests mainly in unquoted venture capital holdings and aims to provide long-term tax-free returns to shareholders through a combination of dividend yield and capital growth. Financial highlights (comparative figures as at 31 March 2024): * Excluding proposed final dividend payable on 5 September 2025. ** Based on net asset value per share at the start of the period. ^ Definitions of the terms and alternative performance measures used in this report can be found in the glossary of terms in the annual report. Chair’s statement OverviewI am pleased to report that in the year ended 31 March 2025, the Company delivered a return of 3.8 pence per share (2024: 1.4 pence), equivalent to 6.6% of the opening net asset value (NAV) per share. Investment activity during the year remained buoyant with a total of £14.6 million invested in 17 promising early stage businesses, of which six were new investments. The Company divested its holdings in six companies, raising total proceeds of £11.0 million. In the financial year under review, we saw a change of government in the UK with the Labour Party elected in July 2024. Significant changes were announced in the 2024 UK autumn budget. The new government set out its priorities to drive economic growth. However it also saw tax rises and other changes to address the level of government borrowing. Positively, the 2024 UK autumn budget included the extension of the VCT scheme by a further 10 years which was very welcome as it gave certainty to the VCT sector allowing capital to continue to flow and be invested in early stage, high growth businesses. Although the UK economy has displayed some resilience, with inflation easing from its peak and interest rates starting to fall, there have been reductions in independent growth forecasts and the overall GDP growth outlook remains challenging. It is pleasing to note that the Company has continued its pace of investment activity and grown its NAV per share against this economic backdrop. Since the financial year end, there has been an increase in volatility in the financial markets driven by external factors. In particular, the trade policies of President Trump’s administration in respect of tariffs on international trading partners have had significant and wide-ranging impacts on political relations. This has resulted in a lowering of forecasts for global growth. Although the tariffs are on goods rather than services, the USA is a key market for expansion for a number of our portfolio companies and therefore an early resolution over trade arrangements will be welcomed. Despite the macroeconomic environment, our share offer to raise £15 million was oversubscribed and I would like to thank existing shareholders for their continued support and warmly welcome new investors. Proceeds from the share offer, together with sales proceeds from investments mean that the Company is well positioned both to pursue new opportunities to support small and medium businesses and to work with existing portfolio companies to realise their growth plans. Results and dividendThe NAV per share as at 31 March 2025, after deducting dividends paid during the year totalling 2.9 pence, was 58.3 pence compared with 57.3 pence as at 31 March 2024. Given the increase in NAV per share of the Company and the conditions for the payment of a performance fee being met, a performance fee of £321,000 (year ended 31 March 2024: £nil) is payable to the Manager and has been provided for in the financial statements. In 2018, your Directors set an objective of paying an annual dividend representing a yield of at least 5% of the opening NAV per share in each year whilst endeavouring to protect the NAV from erosion over the medium term. Your Board is conscious of the need to balance payment of dividends while also growing NAV per share and sees this as a medium term target. Given the number of profitable realisations over the past few years and the prospects for good realisations from the current portfolio, the Board considers that the 5% dividend target is still appropriate. Having already declared an interim dividend of 1.7 pence per share which was paid in January 2025, your Directors now propose a final dividend of 1.3 pence per share. The total of 3.0 pence per share is equivalent to 5.2% of the opening NAV of 57.3 pence per share, and is consistent with the total pence per share dividends declared in respect of the previous financial year. The proposed final dividend will be paid on 5 September 2025, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The target dividend yield will remain subject to regular review and the level of future dividend distributions will continue to reflect the level of returns generated by the Company in the medium term, the timing of investment realisations, the availability of distributable reserves and continuing compliance with the VCT scheme rules. Investment portfolioThe Company continues to be a generalist investor, with allocations predominantly in the software & AI, consumer and health & life sciences sectors. Investment levels have remained strong, with £9.3 million of capital provided to six new venture capital companies and £5.3 million of follow-on capital invested into 11 existing portfolio investments. There were six exits in the year, the most notable being Gentronix, sold for net proceeds of £5.2 million compared to an original cost of £1.2 million, a 4.5 times lifetime return. Over the year the Company saw increases in the valuations of portfolio by an aggregate of £5.3 million. Strong trading in a number of portfolio companies led to uplifts in valuations such as Pure Pet Food (£3.0 million), and Project Glow TopCo (t/a The Beauty Tech Group) (£3.4 million). It was also necessary to reduce the valuation of two portfolio companies in particular – Adludio (£2.6 million), due to the decision to cease funding, and Newcells Biotech (£1.5 million), due to poorer trading than expected. Your Directors always consider the state of the investment markets and how these might impact the valuations of the unquoted venture portfolio and have updated valuations to reflect current market conditions where appropriate. Cash balancesThe Company’s liquid funds are held in in a money market fund and interest bearing bank accounts. As at 31 March 2025, £31.0 million (out of a total of £38.1 million of cash and cash equivalent balances) was invested in the Blackrock ICS Sterling Liquidity Fund. Interest income generated from the Company’s liquid funds generated £2.1 million interest income in the year. Share offer and liquidityIn April 2024 shares related to the second allotment of the 2023/24 share offer, totalling £20 million, were issued. This allotment saw the issuance of 17,376,231 new ordinary shares, yielding gross subscriptions of £10.4 million. As a result of the public share offer launched in January 2025, 25,531,778 new ordinary shares were issued in April 2025, yielding gross proceeds of £15.0 million. The Board continues to monitor liquidity carefully and plans to raise up to £10 million of new capital in the 2025/26 tax year. Further details will be provided in due course. Our dividend investment scheme continues to operate. This enables shareholders to invest their dividends in new ordinary shares free of dealing costs and with the benefit of the tax reliefs available on new VCT share subscriptions. During the year 13.6% of total dividends were reinvested by shareholders. We have maintained our policy of being willing to buy back the Company’s shares in the market when necessary in order to maintain liquidity, at a 5% discount to NAV. During the year, a total of 7,774,750 shares were repurchased for cancellation, equivalent to approximately 3.7% of the opening share capital. Responsible investmentThe Company continues to be mindful of its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) responsibilities and we have outlined our evolving approach in the annual report. Board changesCecilia McAnulty, who has served on the board of the Company since 2014, shall be retiring after the Company’s AGM. Cecilia is the Company’s Senior Independent Director and prior to that served as the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Board would like to take this opportunity to extend their sincere thanks to Cecilia for her guidance, insights and commitment to the Company during her tenure. We wish her the best in her future endeavours. In addition, I will be stepping down as Chair of the Company on the conclusion of the Company’s AGM and will seek re-election to continue to serve as a non-executive director. Thomas Chambers who joined our board on 19 June 2024, and with whom I have worked closely, will succeed me as Chair. The Board intends to recruit an experienced director to support the investment strategy of the Company and our growth objectives. VCT legislation and qualifying status The Company has continued to meet the stringent and complex qualifying conditions laid down by HM Revenue & Customs for maintaining its approval as a VCT. The Manager monitors the position closely and reports regularly to the Board. Philip Hare & Associates LLP has continued to act as independent adviser to the Company on VCT taxation matters. Following final review by the European Union and the issuance of the necessary statutory instrument, in September 2024 the Sunset Clause was extended until 2035. The ‘Sunset Clause’ is a European state aid requirement which, without extension, would have removed the VCT tax reliefs that investors receive on newly issued VCT shares. Whilst no further amendments to VCT legislation have been announced, it is possible that further changes will be made in the future. We will continue to work closely with the Manager to maintain compliance with the scheme rules at all times. Investor communicationsThe Board is conscious of its responsibility to communicate transparently and regularly with shareholders. Investor information is contained on the Company website and communications are sent to shareholders who have consented to receive such information. We look forward to welcoming shareholders to our AGM and to our forthcoming investor seminar to be held on 7 October 2025 in London. A copy of our most recent newsletter and details of how to register for the October seminar can be found on the Company’s website at www.mercia.co.uk/vcts/n2vct/. Audit tender processFollowing a formal and rigorous audit tender process, the Audit and Risk Committee has resolved that it intends to recommend Johnston Carmichael LLP for appointment as the Company’s auditor for the financial year ending 31 March 2026, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in 2025. Forvis Mazars will remain the Company’s auditor until the AGM in 2025. The Board would like to thank Forvis Mazars LLP for their diligent service over the past five years. Annual General Meeting The Company’s AGM will take place on 6 August 2025. The AGM provides an excellent opportunity for shareholders, directors and the Manager to meet in person, exchange views and comment. We intend to hold the 2025 AGM in person at Fora, 210 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DA. We also intend to offer remote access for shareholders through an online webinar facility for those who would prefer not to travel. Please note that shareholders attending remotely must register their votes ahead of time, as it will not be possible to count votes from online participants at the AGM. Outlook Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our commitment remains steadfast in providing patient capital to nurture innovative early-stage businesses across the UK. We remain positive about the resilience, diversity and growth potential of the portfolio and its ability to generate long term shareholder value. We thank our investors for their continuing support. David Gravells Chair17 June 2025 Extracts from the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025 are set out below.

Risk managementThe Board carries out a regular and robust assessment of the risk environment in which the Company operates and seeks to identify new risks as they emerge. The principal and emerging risks and uncertainties identified by the Board which might affect the Company’s business model and future performance, and the steps taken with a view to their mitigation, are as follows: The Board continually assesses and monitors emerging risks that could impact the Company’s operations and strategic objectives. As part of the risk assessment process, the Board evaluates a wide range of potential threats and uncertainties that may arise from evolving market dynamics, regulatory changes, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, geopolitical developments, and other external factors. By remaining aware of emerging risks, the Board ensures that the Company is better equipped to anticipate challenges and adapt swiftly to changing circumstances.

Title: Trump Media Seeks Approval For Dual Crypto ETF Focused On Bitcoin And Ethereum

Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will invest in both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies. This filing, reported by Reuters, marks the second exchange-traded fund proposal from the company in less than two weeks, indicating a strong push into the digital asset market. If approved, the proposed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF would enter a crowded market already dominated by established players like BlackRock, whose iShares Bitcoin ETF boasts an impressive $72.5 billion in assets. Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, emphasized the hurdles faced by new entrants in this sector. “It will be a challenge for any new entrant in this market,” he noted, adding that the primary ways to stand out will be through competitive fees or strong branding. Currently, similar exchange-traded funds charge operation fees around 0.12%, but details on the fees for Trump Media’s new offerings for the dual Bitcoin and Ethereum funds remain undisclosed. The latest filing also specifies an allocation strategy between Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating that the fund will initially hold three Bitcoin for every Ethereum token. This approach suggests a strategic positioning that could appeal to investors looking for a balanced exposure to both leading cryptocurrencies. Sui Chung, CEO and chairman of CF Benchmarks, pointed out that the unique aspect of these ETFs may lie in their marketing strategy: There is little that is different about this new venture other than the way it could be markete. Given Truth Social’s involvement, it may very well be that (these) are marketed directly to individual investors and that this ends up getting attention from those investors in the same way that people who love their iPhones buy Apple stock At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,715, marking a 4.1% gain on the monthly timeframe. This comes as the market’s leading cryptocurrency failed once again to gain a foothold above the key $111,000 mark, preventing it from making new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is trading 4% below its record price. Ethereum, on the other hand, trades at approximately $2,613 per token. It has recorded gains of a little over 5% in the past thirty days and has been one of the best performers for June so far. Nevertheless, ETH remains well below its record high, which was reached nearly four years ago. There is a 46% gap between the current price and the record high of $4,878.

Posted on 06/17/2025 6:52:46 AM PDT by delta7 On Sunday, June 15, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the explosive claim on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier that Iran was behind the two assassination attempts on President Trump. We beg to differ. We, the American People, Invite the FBI & DOJ to Be Heroes of Transparency Uncover the Explosive Ukrainian-Linked Patterns in the Trump Assassination Plots and Include the Butler Attempt by Thomas Matthew Crooks Critical Data on Crooks’ Encrypted Communications Remains Hidden — Will the FBI & DOJ Step Up to Unveil Who Thomas Matthew Crooks Was Communicating With?……. ……..Now, we’re going to take you on an eye-opening journey through newly uncovered connections — a web of striking coincidences that should not only shock you but also reveal a clear and present danger. These revelations expose uncomfortable truths, and the American people now respectfully call on the directors of our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to address these serious questions directly to the American public. We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

These revelations expose uncomfortable truths, and the American people now respectfully call on the directors of our intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice to address these serious questions directly to the American public. We specifically invite Kash Patel, Dan Bongino, and DOJ Director Pam Bondi to speak publicly about this critical information. If, for any reason, they are unable to disclose it due to an ongoing investigation, then at a minimum, they should immediately consider briefing the President of the United States. His life is on the line, and he deserves to know all the facts in the Butler case — including which encrypted networks the suspect was using, which overseas servers were involved, which platforms they belonged to, and most importantly, who he was communicating with: which handles, personas, or entities were on the other end…. Everyone remembers Ryan Wesley Routh, the deranged individual who showed up and lay in wait along the fence line of Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida — poised to ambush President Trump in a second assassination attempt….. …. While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

While in Ukraine, Ryan Wesley Routh advocated for the war against Russia and spent time recruiting foreign fighters from Afghanistan. He appeared in a slickly produced propaganda video, and rumors quickly spread online claiming it was from BlackRock, similar to the one Thomas Matthew Crooks was seen in. However, this was not accurate and was quite possibly disinformation. Our investigation confirmed that the video Routh was seen in originated from a production team dedicated to the support of the Azov Battalion. It was first published on May 1, 2022, by the X account SAVE AZOV, which promotes the 4308 Regiment and urges Ukrainian authorities and world leaders to support the Azov Brigade. The video was produced by Олександр Алфьоров and appeared on a YouTube channel under the handle @OleksandrAlforov, directly connecting it to Azov’s media operation. Cellphone data confirms that on September 15, 2024, Routh positioned himself along the tree line at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, waiting nearly 12 hours for an opportunity to strike. From 1:59 a.m. to 1:31 p.m., he remained stationed along the perimeter of the golf course — a chilling display of premeditation and patience. According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion.

Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., President Trump’s decision to play golf that day was a last-minute decision, entirely off the record and not on his official schedule. “The president wasn’t even really supposed to go there,” Rowe stated. But Routh was already there — hours earlier. That suggests inside knowledge or surveillance beyond coincidence. A newly unsealed FBI affidavit reveals that 17-year-old Wisconsin native Nikita Casap — who murdered his parents, stole $14,000 in cash, and plotted to assassinate President Trump using a militarized drone — was communicating via Telegram with an overseas phone number registered to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s largest mobile carriers. Casap was communicating with at least two individuals connected to Ukraine. One of these handlers used the Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ,” which translates to Roman Viktorovych, linked to a Vodafone Ukraine phone number. The affidavit further reveals that Casap discussed post-assassination escape plans with Roman Viktorovych, asking how long he would need to hide before being moved to Ukraine and whether he could expect to live a normal life there. The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Telegram account linked to the overseas phone number +380 50 259 5318 — registered under Vodafone Ukraine — was found to be communicating in Cyrillic script, specifically written in the Ukrainian language. The Telegram username “PoМаН ВіКТОВИЧ” — written in Ukrainian Cyrillic — translates to Roman Viktorovych, the shadowy figure linked to a foreign cell guiding a would-be Trump assassin. How We Confirmed It Was Ukrainian, Not Russian: 1. Country Code +380 The +380 prefix is the internationally recognized country code for Ukraine, confirming the phone number is Ukrainian in origin. The mobile prefix 050 specifically identifies the number as belonging to Vodafone Ukraine, one of the country’s leading mobile operators. 2. Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Telegram Display Name: РОМаН ВіКТОВИЧ This is the Cyrillic version of the name Roman Viktorovych. The presence of the letter “і” in “ВіКТОВИЧ” is key: The letter “і” is used in Ukrainian, but not in modern Russian (Russian uses “и” instead). Ukrainian also includes unique letters like “ї”, “є”, and “ґ” which do not appear in the Russian alphabet. 3. Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion.

Script Usage in Context The Telegram user under this number also communicated with Nikita Casap in Cyrillic script, as confirmed by the FBI affidavit. The linguistic patterns in the messages observed align with Ukrainian Cyrillic orthography, not Russian. 4. Affidavit Clues The FBI affidavit references that at least two individuals Casap communicated with “wrote in Cyrillic.” Cross-analysis of names and phonetics — especially “ВіКТОВИЧ” — confirms Ukrainian spelling. These are just some of the chilling communications uncovered between 17-year-old would-be assassin Nikita Casap and multiple Telegram accounts — including at least two that communicated in Ukrainian Cyrillic As part of his diabolical plot, Casap brutally murdered his mother and stepfather to steal $14,000 in cash — money he intended to use to acquire a customized militarized drone capable of dropping and detonating an explosive device in an attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump. He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion.

He actively coordinated an escape plan to Ukraine, even asking one handler if he could still live a “normal life” there — even if the world found out what he had done. One of the Telegram accounts instructed Casap on how to hide the bodies of his parents, advising him to drag them into the basement to avoid detection. According to the FBI affidavit, he was also given specific instructions on how to swap out the license plate on his stepfather’s vehicle to evade law enforcement, along with a carefully mapped escape route that took him from southeastern Wyoming, through Kansas, to a waypoint near Pumpkin Center, Oklahoma — a remote location likely chosen to avoid detection — before continuing to California, where he planned to await extraction to Ukraine. 200 wheels” is almost certainly terrorist code for explosive materials or fragmentation elements intended to maximize casualties when detonated by the drone. He was also actively communicating in Nazi chat groups on Telegram, specifically within the Terrorgram network, and was linked to The Order of Nine Angles and the Misanthropic Division — a Ukrainian Nazi accelerationist group historically linked to the Azov Battalion. The Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump International Hotel On January 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The driver, identified as 37-year-old U.S. Army Master Sergeant Matthew Livelsberger, was a highly decorated Green Beret with deployments in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and the Congo. Authorities reported that Livelsberger shot himself in the head just before the explosion, which was caused by fireworks and fuel canisters packed inside the vehicle.…… TOPICS: Crime/Corruption; Foreign Affairs; Government KEYWORDS: assasination; ukraine Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Business FILE PHOTO: Four thousand U.S. dollars are counted out by a banker counting currency at a bank in Westminster, Colorado November 3, 2009. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Applied Intuition raised $600 million in a funding round and tender offer that valued the automotive software supplier at $15 billion, more than doubling its valuation from last year in a sign of strong investment appetite for autonomous vehicle technology. The round was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and accounts alongside venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. New investors included Franklin Templeton and Qatar Investment Authority, the company said on Tuesday. In the previous round in March last year, the company was valued at $6 billion and included funding from Porsche, in what was the first time the startup raised money from an automaker. The funds will help Applied Intuition double down on investments in autonomous technology at a time when companies across the sector attempt to ramp up their push for self-driving cars.

Title: Spiritans’ promise of redress must be ‘substantiated by actions’, says abuse survivors group

Redress proposals for abuse survivors by the Spiritan congregation, which runs Blackrock College and other leading schools in Ireland, “urgently needs to be substantiated by actions”, survivors’ group Restore Together has said. It represents people who were sexually abused at Spiritan-run schools. Group spokesman Philip Feddis said “urgent delivery of a victim-centred, non-adversarial redress scheme is critical”. Ongoing delays on the order’s part are “undermining the benefits of what has been delivered to date”, he said. His comments follow a public commitment by Spiritan Provincial Fr Brendan Carr to pay redress to survivors of abuse in the schools. By last November, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. In an open letter on Monday to survivors of abuse by members and employees of the Spiritans, Fr Carr announced “a restorative framework which we hope can help all to arrive at a different place in this painful and difficult journey”. This, he said, was prepared “with the help of Restore Together, One Voice, and other significant advocates and individuals who were abused in our schools and other contexts, who have engaged directly with us”. Fr Carr said the Spiritans have established a “finance advisory team, with the expertise to lead a strategic restructuring of the Province’s assets”. It would “fast-track the development of sustainable funding streams, including immediate and medium-term provisions for redress”. He hoped that by the end of this summer he could “provide a further, more detailed update of the progress we are making in forging new paths to create a just redress scheme”. In response, Mr Feddis said “victims/survivors will judge the statement based on actions and how soon they receive restorative justice in its entirety”. He stated that a redress scheme is the “most urgent and important element”. Delivery of a full restorative justice programme by the Spiritans is “already long overdue”, Mr Feddis added. The order’s “ongoing delays” undermine what has been delivered to date – an apology and therapy – and “diminishes the potential for restorative justice to have full effect for victims/ survivors”, he said. Victims and survivors must have “active decision-making input” in determining what is best for their healing, Mr Feddis said, adding that “justice delayed is justice denied, and that is where we are at”. He said Restore Together will work intensively with the Spiritans to address how the three inactivated elements of the programme can be “enabled as soon as humanly possible”.

Title: Is The Green Transition Financially Viable Today? A Debate At SXSW London

ByJoan Michelson ByJoan Michelson, Contributor. Debaters at SXSW London Nature & Climate House. L to R: Marissa Drew, Fiona Howarth, Rhian-Mari ... More Thomas, Erinch Sahan, Chaitanya Kumar and Kathy Baughman-McLeod. “What we are trying to get at is whether we can realistically and successfully invest our way to a green future considering our current economic system and the state of the climate emergency.” That is how Sophie Lambin, CEO of Kite Insights, tee’d up a friendly debate held at SXSW London last week in one of the more interesting sessions there. SXSW London Street sign Kite Insights curated it and moderated the “for” side of the debate. Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, president, International of The New York Times Company, moderated the “against” side. Held at the Nature & Climate House, presented by SXSW London partner Bellwethers Group on June 5th in the heart of London’s Shoreditch neighborhood, the “debate” including six expert debaters. Debate moderators, Sophie Lambin and Stephen Dunbar-Johnson Three experts argued on the “for” side that the green transition is financially viable today. They were: Rhian-Mari Thomas, Ph.D., CEO, Green Finance Institute; Marisa Drew, Chief Sustainability Officer, Standard Chartered Bank; and Fiona Howarth, Founder/CEO of Octopus Electric Vehicles. The three experts arguing “against,” that is that the green transition is not financially viable today, were: Enrich Sahan, Business and Enterprise Lead at Doughnut Economics Action Lab; Chaitanya Kumar, Acting Head of Economic and Environmental Policy at the New Economics Foundation; and Kathy Baughman-McLeod, CEO of Climate Resilience For All. UN Estimates Green Economy worth $10 trillion - 2022, press.un.org “The UN estimates that globally the green economy could be worth $10.3 trillion by 2030, and the IEA (International Energy Agency) says it could be as much as $100 trillion by 2050. These are humongous numbers, but it's not just about the numbers,” Dunbar-Johnson said, framing the discussion. Thomas summarized the “for” team’s position by saying, “We stand firmly in support of the motion. Yes, the green transition is financially viable. Indeed. Not only is it viable, it is economically strategic, it is socially imperative and it is already underway.” Debate - Fiona Howarth Howarth went so far as to call it, “the biggest financial opportunity that we have seen for decades, both for s companies and individuals.” Then the “for” team quoted statistics including: Rhian-Mari Thomas headshot, from SXSW London website Thomas explained that, “The upfront investments in clean energy, sustainable infrastructure, and low carbon technologies are not costs to be feared or to be avoided. They're investments that shield us, that protect us from the catastrophic economic consequences of unchecked climate change. Trillions in disaster damages, food system breakdowns, migration crises and social unrest. Every fraction of a degree we prevent not only saves economies, but it saves lives.” “It isn't viable today. That's what we are debating,” Erinch Sahan began the arguments for the “against” team. He removed his belt to dramatically illustrate that, “Financial markets have become a straitjacket. It's wrapped around business, it's wrapped around economic activities wrapped around governments, it's wrapped around the private sector and it's become a straitjacket on the transition itself.” He described it as “an economy that's in service to finance,” which is inconsistent with the green economy. Erinch Sahan These are the facts the ”against” team cited: These factoids “symbolize the fact that incumbent power and the political economy of the transition is still very much held by fossil fuel interests around the world,” Kumar said. Screenshot - UN Women, how climate change & gender inequality are interconnected - April 2025 Baughman-McLeod added their view that the transition is not viable at this moment also because, “Externalities that are absolutely freed while shareholders and companies take home profit. Biodiversity is lost, children are working in mines. We have sweatshops, we have methane and carbon pollution pumping out, it's free, and the shareholders take the money and everyone else gets the short end of the stick. (This is) the market we have, not necessarily the market we wish to have.” “Externalities” also include the impact on women, she emphasized, who often suffer miscarriages, lost wages, and poor health as a result of climate-exacerbated conditions. Which side made the best argument in your view? *Note: This took place in the U.K. so some experts quoted in US dollars and others in British pounds.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market show tentative signs of recovery following the most recent correction, a crypto analyst has made a bold statement suggesting that the market may have already reached its peak. BladeDeFi, in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), warned followers that a significant downturn could be on the horizon, predicting a challenging summer ahead for the crypto space. In his post, BladeDeFi emphasized that “crypto has already PEAKED” and forecasted a potential slump where alternative cryptocurrencies could see declines of up to 95%. He indicated that most indicators are flashing red, suggesting that the market is on the brink of a significant downturn. According to him, Bitcoin has already hit its all-time high early in the current cycle and is now trapped in a “slow-motion downtrend,” with each subsequent bounce becoming weaker than the last. The analyst pointed out a concerning trend: retail investors are becoming exhausted, while larger institutional players have begun to exit the market. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and MicroStrategy are reportedly rotating their investments and hedging their positions, often without making their actions overtly public. The analyst suggests that this shift leaves retail investors vulnerable, potentially left holding depreciating assets as liquidity in the market continues to dwindle. BladeDeFi also criticized the current market dynamics, warning that sudden price increases or “green candles” are often deceptive, serving only to entice late buyers into traps that lead to further losses. He noted that without new capital inflows—such as fresh stimulus or significant investment—the recent price pumps lack sustainability. The absence of liquidity means that any upward movements are likely to be fleeting, and the overall trend remains downward. Adding to the bearish sentiment, another analyst, Peppeso, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the top of the 2025 bull market has already been established. Peppeso observed historical patterns in previous market cycles, noting that while bull markets have become longer, bear markets have shortened and softened in their impact. Despite this, Bitcoin has consistently reached all-time highs in the final months of each cycle, reinforcing Peppeso’s expectation of a peak around November or December 2025. The current market environment is further complicated by macroeconomic factors, including rising interest rates and increasing geopolitical risks. With uncertainty clouding the outlook, many investors are adopting a risk-off approach, leading to a sustained downtrend in the crypto market. Even popular memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant declines of 9% and 7% in the past week alone respectively, indicating that the hype surrounding these assets is fading.

Title: Wall Street pay is headed for change as more firms embrace alternative assets: Report
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-goldman-sachs-carried-interest-private-equity-johnson-report-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-17T09:00:02Z

More Wall Street executives are getting paid like private equity bosses — a trend that's only going to continue as the lines between public and private markets blur, according to a new report. Wall Street compensation firm Johnson Associates released a report this month predicting that more investment banks and traditional asset managers will start paying their executives with a form of compensation traditionally associated with the private equity industry. Carried interest is a share of the profits earned by investment managers, often 20%, after a fund returns capital to investors. It's helped many private equity bosses reach billionaire status in recent decades. "Many financial services firms see alternatives as a key area of growth for the future," said Bryan Liou, managing director at Johnson Associates. "They want to emphasize it, they want to signal to the market that they're serious about it." He pointed to BlackRock, known for its bonds and ETFs business. The $12 trillion asset manager has been expanding into real estate, infrastructure, and other alternative assets in an effort to diversify into private investments. Last year, BlackRock's board introduced a carried interest component to CEO Larry Fink's future pay for the first time, SEC documents show. Goldman Sachs also paid CEO David Solomon and other C-Suite executives a portion of their compensation through carry last year for the first time ever. BlackRock said it made the change to "align CEO compensation with the evolution of BlackRock's private markets platform." Goldman, in an SEC filing, said the change will help it compete for talent with alternative asset managers. At both firms, carried interest payments were previously reserved for professionals who worked directly in private markets investing. As more firms look to expand their private markets offerings, however, interest in carried interest is expected to grow. "I think this is the beginning of a longer-term trend," said Liou. "This is the first time we've seen it, but it's certainly not the last time we'll see it, and we certainly don't think it's going to be limited to just BlackRock and Goldman Sachs in the future."

Title: Swiss asset manager Partners Group sets up ADGM office in regional expansion push | The National

Business June 17, 2025 Partners Group, a Switzerland-based private market investment company with $150 billion in assets under management, is expanding its presence in the Middle East with the opening of a new regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi financial centre ADGM. The push to broaden its regional footprint is part of the company’s strategy to tie up with institutional investors to capitalise on opportunities within the technology-led transformation of industries, “often with a nexus to the region”, it said in a statement on Tuesday. The move is about breaking bread with investors, being close and enabling a deeper partnership to invest globally, Partners Group's regional managing director told The National. "We cut out the noise," Suhail Albaz said. "We try and make our decisions based on our strategic priorities. We appreciate that there are people that you know, are trying to come over here and have short-term goals, but that's not us." Steffen Meister, executive chairman of the board, said Abu Dhabi is "increasingly becoming a centre of gravity for global advancements in technology, energy, next-generation manufacturing and digital services". “It is attracting increasing amounts of capital, drawn to the regional investment opportunities and the chance to partner with Abu Dhabi’s cutting-edge investors on global transactions," he added. Expansion to the UAE capital has increased the number of global offices operated by the company to 22. Partners Group joins a growing list of asset managers, insurers, financial institutions and investment houses that have chosen to set up a base in the financial hub and use it as a platform for their regional expansion. Last week, Harrison Street, a $56 billion US-based real estate and infrastructure investment manager, said it is entering the Middle East market with the opening of an office at ADGM, after it received a financial services licence from ADGM's regulator, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. In February, German asset manager Patrizia was granted approval by the FSRA to start operations at ADGM. The Augsburg-based company, which has about €55 billion ($57.7 billion) in assets under management, plans to arrange and advise real estate investments for clients in the region. The two real estate managers add to a stream of companies that are eager to tap into the Middle East's growing investment market. New York-based BlackRock, the world's top asset manager with nearly $11.5 trillion in assets under management, in November received a commercial licence to operate at ADGM. In September, ADGM welcomed its first trillion-dollar asset managers – PGIM, the global asset management business of the New York Stock Exchange-listed Prudential Financial, and Chicago investment firm Nuveen, with both aiming to expand their operations and client bases in the Middle East. The flurry of new additions has pushed the number of companies in ADGM higher during the first quarter of this year, with assets under management also increasing by 33 per cent annually, the financial hub said this month. The total number of entities operating at ADGM rose by 43 per cent annually to 2,781 in the first three months of this year, it said in a statement. At the end of last year, the financial zone had 2,381 operational entities. Partners Group has maintained a presence in the Middle East since the opening of its Dubai office in 2010. The firm’s investment mandate span private equity, private credit, infrastructure and real estate among other asset classes. Education and health care have been the leading investment themes, said Mr Albaz, given they have natural demand drivers around them, making them an easier entry point into the Middle East. Its current regional portfolio of companies employ more than 2,000 people and many are expanding their footprint. International School Partnerships, founded by Partners Group in 2013, has recently acquired its 10th school in the Middle East, it said. Partners Group is actively assessing investment opportunities in renewables and luxury retail sector companies with solid fundamentals, targeting $1 billion to $1.2 billion equity investment. Mr Albaz said. “The Middle East is a key growth area for Partners Group and we plan to significantly develop our business in the GCC and across the broader region,” said Mr Albaz, who also leads the Abu Dhabi office. "Not only are we focused on deepening our network of regional clients and business partners, but we are also actively pursuing the growing opportunities for transformational investing offered to our portfolio of businesses and assets by establishing themselves in the Middle East.” UAE coins Dh5 note Dh10 note Dh20 note Company Profile Company name: Yeepeey Started: Soft launch in November, 2020 Founders: Sagar Chandiramani, Jatin Sharma and Monish Chandiramani Based: Dubai Industry: E-grocery Initial investment: $150,000 Future plan: Raise $1.5m and enter Saudi Arabia next year Company: Instabug Founded: 2013 Based: Egypt, Cairo Sector: IT Employees: 100 Stage: Series A Investors: Flat6Labs, Accel, Y Combinator and angel investors UAE coins Dh5 note Dh10 note Dh20 note My son and I were lucky to access the best of US health care US election: the roots of a dirty 2020 campaign stretch deep into American political history This is America, a dystopian city on a hill Dr Nawal Al-Hosany: Why more women should be on the frontlines of climate action Shelina Janmohamed: Why shouldn't a spouse be compensated fairly for housework?

Elvis Presley, Mystery Train (1955) The B-side of Presley’s final single for Sun bops with a drummer-less groove. Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two, Folsom Prison Blues (1955) Originally recorded for Sun, Cash’s signature tune was performed for inmates of the titular prison 13 years later. Carl Perkins, Blue Suede Shoes (1956) Within a month of Sun’s February release Elvis had his version out on RCA. Roy Orbison, Ooby Dooby (1956) An essential piece of irreverent juvenilia from Orbison. Jerry Lee Lewis, Great Balls of Fire (1957) Lee’s trademark anthem is one of the era’s best-remembered – and best-selling – songs. Build an emergency fund: Make sure you have enough cash to cover six months of expenses as a buffer against unexpected problems before you begin investing, advises Steve Cronin, the founder of DeadSimpleSaving.com. Think long-term: When you invest, you need to have a long-term mindset, so don’t worry about momentary ups and downs in the stock market. Invest worldwide: Diversify your investments globally, ideally by way of a global stock index fund. Is your money tied up: Avoid anything where you cannot get your money back in full within a month at any time without any penalty. Skip past the promises: “If an investment product is offering more than 10 per cent return per year, it is either extremely risky or a scam,” Mr Cronin says. Choose plans with low fees: Make sure that any funds you buy do not charge more than 1 per cent in fees, Mr Cronin says. “If you invest by yourself, you can easily stay below this figure.” Managed funds and commissionable investments often come with higher fees. Be sceptical about recommendations: If someone suggests an investment to you, ask if they stand to gain, advises Mr Cronin. “If they are receiving commission, they are unlikely to recommend an investment that’s best for you.” Get financially independent: Mr Cronin advises UAE residents to pursue financial independence. Start with a Google search and improve your knowledge via expat investing websites or Facebook groups such as SimplyFI.
