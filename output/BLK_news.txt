By Martin Pengelly in Washington, A new book by the chief architect of Project 2025, a hugely controversial policy plan for a second Trump term, repeatedly employs imagery of fire and burning, including calling for rightwingers to “burn away the rot” of American institutions and organizations deemed opposed to conservative aims. The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to “bring down the temperature” after months of heated political battle. Mixing classical quotes with cliche (“it is time to fight fire with fire”) and metaphors about forest fires and Smokey Bear , Kevin Roberts, president of the far-right Heritage Foundation, advocates “a long, controlled burn” of targets including the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the New York Times, “every Ivy League college” and even the Boy Scouts of America. Related: ‘This victory is a mandate’: rightwing groups ready with policy proposals for new Trump administration Roberts’s book, Dawn’s Early Light : Taking Back Washington to Save America, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy, but the book has proved controversial already. This summer, news outlets used review copies to report violent imagery in an introduction by the Ohio senator JD Vance , Trump’s vice-presidential pick, and to highlight both Roberts’s own violent language and his work on Project 2025 . Roberts’s original subtitle – Burning Down Washington to Save America – also attracted attention, as did incendiary language in promotional materials. As Trump sought to distance himself from the book and Project 2025, including by lying about not knowing Roberts, publication was postponed until after election day. Now, with Trump victorious, Roberts’s heated rhetoric seems likely to alarm progressives all over again. Beginning with a quote from Virgil’s Aeneid – “My spirit kindles to fire, and rises in wrath to avenge my dying land” – Roberts writes: “In 2020, our country went up in flames. “Some of those conflagrations were intentional arson, such as the ‘mostly peaceful’ protests [for racial justice after the police murder of George Floyd] that caused more than a billion dollars in damage [a controversial claim ] in some of America’s greatest cities: Others were more unintentional, such as the record-setting California wildfires that torched more than 4 million acres of our most beautiful forests. “In fact, all those fires were connected. They spring from a conspiracy against nature – against ordered, civilized societies, against common sense and normal people – orchestrated by a network of political, corporate, and cultural elites who share a set of interests quite apart from those of ordinary Americans. “… Be it Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the cities or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the countryside, the … playbook is the same: destroy the embodied institutions that define the American way of life and replace them with ideological commitments and bureaucratic imperatives. “It is time to fight fire with fire.” Alluding to prominent Project 2025 aims – including political purges of the federal government and legal attacks on groups including women and LGBTQ+ Americans – Roberts continues: “Fire has the potential to destroy … To escape our current darkness, restore America’s civic life and take back our country for good, conservatives can’t merely continue putting out fires; we must be brave enough to go on the offense, strike the match and start a long, controlled burn. “There’s plenty of fuel. Like deadwood in a forest, many of America’s institutions have been completely hollowed out … Decadent and rootless, these institutions serve only as shelter for our corrupt elite. Meanwhile, they block out the light and suck up the nutrients necessary for new American institutions to grow. For America to flourish again, they don’t need to be reformed; they need to be burned. A nice start would include: “Every Ivy League college, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, 80% of ‘Catholic’ higher education, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, the Boy Scouts of America, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, and the National Endowment for Democracy.” Roberts does not elaborate on qualifications for his list. But it does contain one name that may jar with rightwing readers: BlackRock, a major financial firm, has been a key investor in Trump Media & Technology Group, the president-elect’s social media company. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s billionaire co-founder, has been linked to an appointment as treasury secretary under Trump. Turning from Virgil – and the composer Gustav Mahler – to Smokey Bear, Roberts says the US Forest Service mascot might not approve of his aims. But, he insists, “any good conservationist can tell you that fire is an intrinsic part of the cycle of life … without regular controlled burns, a conflagration eventually occurs that wrecks the forest rather than renews it.” Saying his aim is “to inspire the New Conservative Movement to rekindle the fire of the American tradition, and to empower real Americans to take back our country”, Roberts says that despite advocating burning down the FBI, he represents “the Party of Creation” against “the Party of Destruction – those who seek to abolish the existing order in the name of emancipation, freedom, and progress”. Related: The force behind Project 2025: Kevin Roberts has the roadmap for a second Trump term Roberts’s fiery imagery and rhetoric does not end there. Elsewhere, he compares progressive policies to Dutch elm disease, with affected bodies needing to be “promptly burned”; says “the only way to revive” institutions “haggard with age, decay, and bloat, is to burn away the rot”; and even meditates on the nature of fire itself. “Man’s taming of fire is the cornerstone of human culture,” Roberts muses. “That’s the funny thing about fire. It is so fleeting, a flame flickering from moment to moment, yet in its evanescence, it is eternal. Of all the elements, fire is most associated with transformation, renewal, and change. You can’t have a blaze without some kind of sacrificial transformation of fuel into fire. Yet precisely for this reason, fire demands an attention to continuity. Unlike any of the other elements, fire dies … a fire must be continually tended.” Particularly, it seems, if it is set under the Boy Scouts of America.

Title: BlackRock sees historic $1.1 billion inflow as spot Bitcoin ETFs have best day ever

Full Content:
Spot Bitcoin ETFs set new record with $1.36 billion combined daily inflow. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic inflow of $1.12 billion on Nov. 7, surpassing previous combined totals for all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This significant capital movement marks the largest single-day inflow in the history of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other major asset managers also reported notable inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC received $190.9 million, while Bitwise’s BITB increased by $13.4 million. Ark’s ARKB gained $17.6 million on the same day, according to data compiled on Nov. 7. The combined inflow hit $1.37 billion, marking the best day in spot Bitcoin ETF history since they launched in January. These inflows coincide with Bitcoin breaking the all-time high several times to a peak of $76,900, breaking previous records twice since the US presidential election on Nov. 5. The surge in Bitcoin’s price and ETF inflows suggests increased institutional interest following the election results. The ETF’s unprecedented inflow outpaced the previous combined total for all similar funds, signaling a potential shift in institutional investment strategies following Trump’s win.

Title: What Trump’s Election Really Means For Crypto?

Donald Trump pledges to make U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the Planet” at 2024 Bitcoin Conference in ... [+] Nashville. Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the crypto landscape could be on the cusp of a major transformation. Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, commitment to reforming crypto regulations, and vocal opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies suggest that U.S. crypto leadership may strengthen significantly in the coming years. Throughout his campaign, Trump has openly supported Bitcoin, aiming to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” He even proposed integrating Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy by creating a national Bitcoin reserve. This pro-Bitcoin stance aligns with Trump’s view that the U.S. should lead in digital finance. Despite years of political and regulatory challenges, the U.S. remains a powerhouse for crypto-focused businesses, driving significant economic impact. Leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pioneering tokenized funds, while VISA and Mastercard offer credit cards linked to crypto wallets, demonstrating mainstream adoption. The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, with $4.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, underscores the industry’s scale. In Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins transacted $8.5 trillion—outpacing Visa’s $3.9 trillion—lead partly by U.S.-based issuers like Circle, Paxos, and PayPal. This leadership highlights the high stakes for regulatory clarity. Some major U.S. companies drive global crypto innovation despite regulatory hurdles, including ... [+] Coinbase, BlackRock, Fidelity, Mastercard, PayPal, Circle and more. Photo by Smith Collection. Under Trump, the regulatory landscape could undergo significant changes. Trump has pledged to dismantle what he views as restrictive regulations, beginning with the dismissal of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whom he blames for the “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump could establish more straightforward, growth-oriented policies by appointing a more crypto-friendly SEC leader. Christopher Perkins, President of the New York-based crypto investment firm CoinFund, highlights the momentum, noting, “The elections in the U.S. were wildly positive for the crypto industry. While Trump has indicated he will be a crypto President, it’s important to note that 261 pro-crypto candidates were elected to Congress. This is the first ‘crypto’ Congress.” Perkins emphasizes, “We expect regulatory clarity, but not overly prescriptive regulation,” describing the outlook as “very bullish for the crypto industry—full stop.” U.S. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at a 2023 House Financial Services Committee hearing on the lawsuits ... [+] against Binance and Coinbase. With Trump’s vow “to fire” Gensler, the focus of crypto regulation may be poised for change. Photo by Jacquelyn Martin. Trump’s opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is clearly rooted in privacy and individual freedom concerns. He supported the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC without congressional approval—a stance echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump’s anti-CBDC position could also influence global trends significantly as central banks like the European Central Bank move forward with their digital currencies. The ECB’s planned CBDC designed to provide accessible, standardized payments across the eurozone, has thus far received limited political attention in Europe, despite concerns over its potential to crowd out the private sector. However, Jonas Gross, Chairman of the Digital Euro Association, believes Trump’s vocal stance could shift this: “If Trump is outspoken against CBDCs, we may see more discussions within the European Parliament,” he suggests, indicating that Trump’s influence may prompt increased scrutiny of the ECB’s approach. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is developing a CBDC for the eurozone—a form of digital money ... [+] issued by a central bank, an approach Trump has firmly rejected. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds. Europe has led the way in crypto regulation, with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) set to take effect by year’s end. Joachim Schwerin, Principal Economist at the European Commission, notes that Europe’s regulatory path reflects its commitment to “balanced, sustainable growth for crypto,” a stance that has already attracted leading U.S. crypto firms seeking European MiCAR licenses. While Trump’s re-election may create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S., Schwerin believes Europe’s approach will remain steady. However, he acknowledges that global competition is heating up, with nations like the Emirates and Switzerland establishing robust frameworks to attract crypto innovation. Crypto enables global transactions across borders and fosters international competition for human ... [+] capital and resources. Regulatory clarity is essential for crypto to allow innovation to flourish. Despite past regulatory challenges, the U.S. has built a strong crypto sector, with major U.S. players driving growth and innovation. Trump’s election could unlock even greater potential by establishing supportive crypto regulation. With a pro-crypto Congress and supportive regulators, the U.S. could strengthen its lead and emerge as the world’s primary hub for decentralized finance. Trump’s anti-CBDC stance may also shape global discussions, prompting central banks to reconsider centralized models. Together, these shifts could position America as a leader in digital finance, navigating a competitive landscape where Europe has already laid significant regulatory groundwork. Yet, as Rhys Bidder, Deputy Director at the Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance, observes, “There have been false dawns for crypto before... the hope must be that the industry builds in a sustainable manner.” With this new U.S. administration, crypto has a unique opportunity to prove itself as a mature and credible sector, dispelling doubts and moving beyond its volatile past.

Title: BlackRock Fund Powers US Bitcoin ETFs to a Record Daily Inflow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin posted a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the digital-asset industry and promise of supportive regulations. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for about 81% of Thursday’s deluge, which came a day after the ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $1.1 billion of net subscriptions for the fund — also known as IBIT — was also unprecedented. The surging investor demand helped to push Bitcoin to another all-time high, with the original cryptocurrency rising as much as 1.7% to $77,272 on Friday. It has set fresh record highs every day since Tuesday. The demand for the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund is another sign of how Trump’s pledge to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry is reshaping the crypto market. Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of crypto exchange BTC Markets Pty, said there is a “significant risk of a feedback loop, where rising ETF inflows push Bitcoin prices higher, attracting more capital.” Much depends now on Trump following through on campaign vows, such as creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. Some technical indicators suggest a two-month rally driven by optimism about Trump’s reelection is now due for a pause. Bitcoin’s roughly 80% advance so far in 2024, partly fueled by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, exceeds the returns from traditional investments such as global stocks and gold.

The fund, which has emerged as a dominant force among its 10 other rivals, has a net asset value of $34.2 billion, bolstered by Bitcoin’s heightened value. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust US data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Investor interest in the world's largest crypto is at an all-time high, which has driven record-setting heights for the asset, above $76,870, amid surging activity among altcoins and meme coins. “The ETFs are accumulating Bitcoin faster than it can be created by a factor of two to one,” Hundal added. “Sooner or later, this will tip across into a broad-based crypto rally. Probably sooner.” It comes as IBIT posted a record $4 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, vastly exceeding its nearest rival, Fidelity, after President-elect Donald Trump secured a second term as the 47th president of the United States. Trump’s Whitehouse win is viewed by many in the industry as a boon for digital assets. He has promised to protect crypto mining interests, establish a Bitcoin reserve, and usher in favorable policy. The ascent of IBIT as a top Bitcoin ETF comes amid shifting sentiment over investments in institutionalized crypto. The fund has maintained steady inflows since inception, while competitor Grayscale's GBTC—the second largest by net assets at $16.8 billion—has faced negative outflows due to its high fees. BlackRock charges a 0.25% fee, waived until January, while GBTC charges significantly higher at 1.5%. Fidelity’s FBTC, meanwhile, also charges 0.25%, though its waiver ended in July.

Title: Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: ‘We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman’

Time Published: 2024-11-08T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s a blustery Dublin day and I’m cycling northside, thinking of Kathleen Watkins. I’m thinking about her elegance and sense of fun and the conversation that flowed from her like music. She died on Thursday having turned 90 last month. She was let out of the hospital especially for that celebration which, I have it on good authority, included afternoon tea and champagne. Our paths had crossed over the years through her late husband, the legendary broadcaster Gay Byrne, and at children’s concerts around town. Her beloved grandchildren and my daughters attended the same music school. I used to look forward to watching her in the audience, wearing a brightly coloured scarf and even brighter lipstick, the proudest, most besotted of grandmothers, lost in the music. But I knew her by reputation long before any of that. Kathleen Watkins, a woman who kept her own surname after marriage back when that was an eyebrow-raising decision, was something of a star past-pupil of my secondary school. She played the harp at Sion Hill in Blackrock, Co Dublin, and later went on to become the first continuity announcer at RTÉ. I’m sad but I’m smiling as I cycle home having just heard the news that she’s gone. There was always fun to be had with Kathleen. Things were “marvellous”, people were “darling”, food was “just divine” and memorable happenings were “the greatest times of my life”. She was one of the most enthusiastic people I’ve ever met. Arranging a lunch a couple of years ago, she texted a string of red wine emojis in anticipation. A mutual friend was celebrating her 70th birthday. “Oh, to be so young,” she texted. She was about to turn 88 herself by that stage. At lunch she was full of stories and plans and endless, fascinating conversation that covered art and music and theatre and family. There were stories of holidays in Donegal where she and Gay palled around with Brian and Anne Friel. My daughters arrived towards the end of the lunch and under pressure from their pushy mother one of them reluctantly recited a poem she’d written. (Well, you try reading your teenage rhymes to a table of adults that included poetry curator Kathleen Watkins and author Marie Heaney, wife of Nobel laureate Seamus.) One of the many great things about Kathleen was that she knew she’d had a wonderful life and she appreciated it deeply. As wife of the host of The Late Late Show she was Gay’s plus-one to glittering events and first-nights, many of which were arts-related, which suited both their interests. Neither of them were party people but they loved cultural goings-on of all kinds. It was “a charmed life”, she would say. “God is too good to me”. It was a more challenging life after losing Gay, who died almost exactly five years ago. They would have been 60 years married last June. She was full of the memories of their partnership. She loved “his sense of humour, the unexpected off-the-cuff quip, he was so smart”. She told me about the way he’d compliment her, noticing a well-tailored new suit she’d bought, saying “well done, Kaysie”. (He called her Kay or Kaysie, never Kathleen and she called him Gabsie. She was Nana Kit to her grandchildren and she answered to nothing else). She told me she missed Gay dreadfully. “But then I’m very spoiled,” she said of having her two daughters Suzy and Crona close by. As well as being endlessly interested in the arts, in music and in poetry, Kathleen was also a massive reader and rugby fan; she finished reading Johnny Sexton’s autobiography Obsessed last week. She’d often watch Sky Arts at 6am in the morning, entranced by ballet productions or concerts live from the Sydney Opera House. A mutual friend remembers going to annual lunches in her and Gay’s apartment in Sandymount, where they’d host his old Late Late Show production team. There were several sketches of Kathleen by Seán Keating hung in the hall, he remembers. Keating was a struggling artist when they were made. Kathleen would sit for him in his lodgings, which had a single bar electric heater, and pay for the drawings, a way of supporting the artist financially without making him feel embarrassed. It’s astonishing to think she began a career as a children’s author in her eighties, with the Pigín books. She was also involved in a number of poetry podcasts. I interviewed her four years ago around the publication of her book One For Everyone, a collection of her favourite poems. I admired how she was never “high falutin’” about poetry. “I’m not a bit like that. I feel poetry is for everybody.” She was particularly fond of a poem called Love After Love by Derek Walcott, she said it spoke to everyone. What did it say to her? “Well, sometimes you put yourself on the back burner. So take time, be at peace, be calm, look and see who you are. Who you were. Things are good aren’t they? They could be worse. Feast on your life, the poem says. That’s important. I was always a glass pretty full person.” There were three poems by the late Derek Mahon in the book, which was dedicated to her late husband with a simple “For Gay”. The final poem in the book, Everything Is Going to be Alright, was the one she believed Byrne would have liked the best and one that gave her comfort as she navigated life without him. “There will be dying, there will be dying, but there is no need to get into that ... Everything is going to be all right.” We’d been texting regularly in recent months, trying to make plans to meet up “for a chat and a cuppa” – we didn’t get around to it and I am now very sad and sorry about that. Still, we were in touch as she managed visits and stays in the Blackrock Clinic where she told me she watched the racing in Cheltenham – “it helps to pass the time”. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] We exchanged war stories, she was always putting a positive spin on even the worst events. She had suffered a few ailments and she texted one day: “a hip problem and two mini-strokes. Never knew they happened. Feeling good”. I told her some of my own troubles. “Lotsa love, K,” she wrote in reply, with some encouraging words that lifted my spirits at a dark time. She was a great one for prayers, “not a holy joe” she clarified to me once, but she was a woman who loved a good Mass. She credited her longevity to “genes and the luck of the draw”. Kathleen had so many poems in her head right until the end, her memory sharp, recalling the words she held dear. She once told me that Gay loved her to recite Beannacht by John O’Donohoe. That poem contains these lines: “When the canvas frays/ In the currach of thought/ And a stain of ocean/ Blackens beneath you,/ May there come across the waters,/ A path of yellow moonlight,/ To bring you safely home.” Lotsa love to you, Kathleen. We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman. Safe home. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Poulet Bonne Femme takeaway review: Delicious and succulent roast chicken with all the trimmings

Husband and wife team Gavin McCarthy and Sara Mitchell launched Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire’s farmers’ market in 2009. Laid off in the 2008 recession, with a newborn son and no interest in emigrating, they gambled Gavin’s redundancy on a rotisserie trailer. At first, they sold roast dinners; the sandwiches came later. With a commitment to high-quality Irish food, Poulet Bonne Femme sources free-range chickens from local farms and makes everything in-store daily. The focus is on family meals – rotisserie chicken, honey roast ham, pork with crackling, and roast Irish beef. Sides are all home-made, from roast potatoes to coleslaw, designed for easy midweek meals and the ultimate Sunday roast. Worth noting is the fact that they are also doing pre-prepared dinners for Christmas, which come with the full works: boned and rolled turkey, honey ham, and every side you’d expect. There are six concessions in Avoca stores around Ireland and there are two stand-alone stores – Blackrock and most recently, Dún Laoghaire, where there is also an area for sit-in. Rotisserie roast chicken, roast potatoes, roast root vegetables, stuffing and gravy. Very pleasant. I rang the Dún Laoghaire shop to check on availability and placed my order on the phone. I picked it up that evening. The rotisserie chicken was absolutely delicious. The skin was crisp and golden with a tasty savoury flavour. The wings were crispy and the leg and breast meat was succulent. The roast potatoes are baby potatoes with skins on, so not quite the crunchy delight you get with conventional roast potatoes. The root vegetables – mainly parsnip and carrots – were very good. The bread stuffing was loose, so needed to be moistened with melted butter, but there was a good taste of herbs running through it. The gravy was a bit muted and was improved by punching up the seasoning and adding a splash of wine and squeeze of lemon juice. Everything except the gravy (plastic container) was packed in paper or those round cardboard cartons we now associate with lockdown meal kits. So crushable and recyclable. €39.05 for dinner for four people: Rotisserie roast chicken, €15.95; roast potatoes, €6.95; roast root vegetables, €6.95; stuffing, €5.25; and gravy, €3.95. Open 9am-6pm in Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock. Sundays are a busy day so call ahead to order. Concessions serve from 10am to 5pm or 6pm. Email catering@poueltbonnefemme.com Yes, this is really good chicken and I love the fact that it’s free-range. Ordering the sides means you have a night off cooking.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $52.3M Inflows as U.S. Election Sparks Crypto Market Gains

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The U.S. spot Ether ETFs experienced a significant boost in inflows just after the U.S. presidential election. The Total inflows for the nine Ethereum ETFs hit $52.3 million. According to data from Farside Investors, this was the largest inflow the Ether-based ETFs had seen in six weeks. The recent inflow is Ethereum’s best performance since late September. The inflow coincided with a 10% price increase in Ethereum, pushing the price of ETH to an intraday high of $2,872, the highest since early August. While $52.3 million may seem small compared to inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it was a big win for Ethereum investors. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a whopping $622 million in inflows on the same day. According to the data, the inflows were primarily driven by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust. Fidelity’s fund attracted the largest share, pulling in $26.9 million. Grayscale followed closely behind with $25.4 million. However, the remaining seven spot Ether ETFs reported zero inflows, leaving a mixed picture for the overall Ether ETF market. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, a leading Ethereum ETF, reported no daily net flows. This stood out as BlackRock is one of the biggest names in the market, and its lack of inflows surprised many. Despite no new funds entering BlackRock’s ETF, investor interest in Ether ETFs remained strong. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has faced significant challenges since its conversion to spot Ether ETF in July. The fund has witnessed more outflows than inflows, with large chunks of capital exiting it daily. Some believe its high fee could be the reason for such occurrence. Since July, Grayscale has seen its assets under management shrink by $3.1 billion. This has contributed to a net outflow of $490 million across all Ethereum ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs maintain dominance over the crypto ETF market, with daily flows significantly exceeding that of Ether ETFs. According to Farside Investor, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive inflow of $621.9 million. This marked a reversal in the trend, as the ETFs had seen three consecutive days of outflows before the election. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the inflows, recording $308.8 million, its largest inflow since June. Several other Bitcoin ETFs also performed well, with Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale all seeing inflows exceeding $100 million each. However, not every Bitcoin ETF had a positive day. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reported outflows for the second consecutive day. IBIT lost $69.1 million in net outflows, according to preliminary data. Despite this, November 6 was BlackRock’s highest volume day, with $4.1 billion traded. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips. Subscribe now!

Title: RICHARD PORTER: Trump Was A Better President Than Biden And A Better Candidate Than Harris

Full Content:
It’s a comeback story for the ages: Despite two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, 34 felony convictions, and coverage from the big three networks that was 85% negative (as opposed to 78% positive for his opponent), former President Donald Trump triumphed over all the hate and the haters to win his second term in the Oval Office. Why? Trump was a better president than President Joe Biden and a better candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris. Ordinary Americans enjoyed measurably more fruitful lives under Trump than Biden. And Trump is noticeably more authentic, relatable, charming, clever, convincing, insightful, intuitive and fun than Harris. Trump won on both policy and personality. Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America — media, academia, and big business, too — not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. Oh, and the movie and rock stars, too. Harrison Ford movingly told us over the weekend that he voted for Harris and Tim Walz. The core of his pitch was that “these two people believe in the rule of law; they believe in science; they believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans. They believe that we are in this together… Look, I’m frustrated about a lot of things in this country, I’m sure you are, too. But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other, while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.” It is a passionate pitch, but it fell flat because most of us didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. For those of us who are frustrated about what the government has been doing, it’s merely a beautifully narrated lie. It was a call to trust the prosecutors and the judges who cynically used the courts as a partisan weapon while braying about their fealty to the “rule of law.” To believe government bureaucrats who silenced those who dared to question the origins and effects of COVID-19 — and were later proven right. To ignore the dishonesty of national security officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake even though they knew it wasn’t. To forget that they ran for office claiming that they wanted to unite the country while working full-time to divide it — solely for the purpose of winning elections. We didn’t go along. So, Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. During his first trip overseas as president, Biden addressed the U.S. troops stationed in England. It wasn’t an auspicious beginning. “When I first was elected vice president with President Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were,” he said. “This is not a joke: you know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming.” Despite the disclaimer, a “joke” was exactly what this sounded like. Or, rather, a spoof of liberal excess. Biden was addressing men and women who had signed up to risk their lives on the battlefield to protect their fellow Americans. And he was giving them Democratic Party talking points. The obvious inference to be drawn is that the new commander in chief was in over his head and that the Pentagon is run by suck-ups or idiots. Both perceptions were reinforced soon thereafter, a few months later, by the United States’ disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. When a military focuses on something other than fighting wars, it is on the road to failure. Similarly, nearly all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with facilitating capital formation and discouraging fraud, not suppressing carbon emissions. FEMA’s core mission is to swiftly respond to and remediate disasters, not to find taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants. The FBI’s core mission is to protect citizens from crime and terrorism, not from conservative Catholics. And it is not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. If the information being conveyed does not reflect observable reality, then the press has failed in its core mission. Think of the memorable scenes of 2020 when cable news reporters would describe “mostly peaceful protests” while fires ravaged buildings behind them. The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated on campus today? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That is why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it is auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there is not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, during the COVID pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similar manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy who drives all those pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Trump and his merry band of bold critics — including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard — are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.

Title: BlackRock in talks to buy minority stake in Millennium, sources say

By Paritosh Bansal and Carolina Mandl (Reuters) -BlackRock is in early-stage talks with Millennium Management about a strategic tie-up that could involve acquiring a minority stake in the hedge fund, two sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said it was not clear whether the talks would result in a deal, with one of them adding that the strategic rationale of a transaction was also unclear. The Financial Times reported earlier on the potential deal. Millennium, founded by Israel Englander, manages roughly $70 billion. The multi-strategy hedge fund is up 10% for the year to the end of October, one of the sources and a separate person familiar with the matter said. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which ended September with about $11.5 trillion in assets, has been on an acquisition spree this year as it looks to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. In October, BlackRock completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, putting it at the heart of investing in infrastructure projects around the world. Later this year, BlackRock is expected to finalize its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin, aiming to strengthen its position in private markets. These strategic moves are anticipated to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and private markets, both key growth areas.

Title: Why Is The AES Corporation (AES) Among the Best Electricity Utility Stocks to Invest In Now?

Time Published: 2024-11-08T00:45:12Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Electric Utility Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) stands against the other electric utility stocks. Utilities have historically been seen as defensive assets, so the combination of strong economic growth, technological excitement, and higher bond yields has created an unusual backdrop for their recent outperformance. In 2023, the U.S. power and utilities sector made significant strides in decarbonization, setting new records in solar power deployment and energy storage, and enhancing grid reliability and flexibility. The sector experienced mixed fundamentals, with mild weather leading to a slight decline in electricity sales. Wholesale electricity prices fell alongside lower natural gas costs, yet high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, along with rising interest rates, contributed to potential increases in customer bills. In 2024 however, the utility sector seems to have outperformed the broader market, diverging from its typical sensitivity to long-term interest rates. Jefferies analysts, in a report released on September 19, attributed this outperformance to AI-related growth opportunities and the sector’s defensive nature amid a softening economy. With falling rates, rising electricity usage, and expectations for increased data center demand linked to AI, the typically stable utility stocks have seen an unprecedented rally. This trend has driven gains in ETFs and mutual funds centered on utilities, including the $18 billion Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF, which has returned 21.77% year-to-date as of November 5, outperforming many other SPDR sector funds. Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar, noted: “Utilities have rebounded sharply since their October 2023 low as the market began anticipating a shift toward lower interest rates and an increase in US energy demand. AI data centers and manufacturing growth represent the biggest sources of potential energy demand growth for utilities in decades.” Expanding on that, Mckinsey states that the rapid adoption of digitalization and AI has sharply increased the demand for data centers in the United States. To match the current pace of adoption, data center power needs are expected to grow to roughly three times today's capacity by 2030, rising from 3–4% of total U.S. power demand to about 11–12%. Meeting this demand will require a significant increase in electricity production, marking an unprecedented shift in the U.S., where overall power demand has been mostly flat since 2007. Data center load could represent 30–40% of all net new demand through 2030, alongside growing needs from domestic manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrolyzers. From 2024 to 2030, electricity demand from data centers alone is projected to rise by approximately 400 terawatt-hours, with a compound annual growth rate of about 23%. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.5% rate cut, or 50 basis points, is anticipated to provide a boost to renewable energy developers and project sponsors. According to Mona Dajani, partner and global co-chair of energy, infrastructure, and hydrogen at law firm Baker Botts, the start of a rate-cutting cycle "will jumpstart projects." She noted the following about renewable initiatives: "They're very sensitive to the cost of capital, particularly for capital-intensive technologies like offshore wind, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and solar [plus] storage.” Dajani further noted that the market expects the Fed to reduce rates by a total of 100 basis points by year-end, which “would support the growth of the domestic supply chain for clean energy, easing the financing and construction of new facilities for solar, batteries, EVs, and wind.” Our Methodology To create our list, we reviewed the stock holdings of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF. We then selected the top 10 electric utility stocks according to the number of hedge funds holding positions in each. The list is ranked in ascending order of hedge fund interest, as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An executive in a power plant control booth overseeing the efficient energy production. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46 The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), based in Texas, operates across 14 countries and has evolved from a consulting firm into a major player in electricity generation and distribution. The company owns and manages power plants and utilities that generate electricity from a diverse mix of sources, including coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. For the third quarter, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) delivered mixed results, beating earnings expectations while missing revenue targets. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, exceeding the analyst consensus of $0.59. However, revenue totaled $3.29 billion, falling short of the forecasted $3.46 billion. The company attributed the revenue miss to lower margins in its Energy Infrastructure segment and severe drought conditions that affected its Renewables business in South America. Despite the shortfall, AES reaffirmed its full-year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.87 to $1.97, in line with the $1.92 consensus, and expects to achieve results in the upper half of the range. On September 19, Mizuho reiterated its positive view on AES, maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $24. This outlook follows AES's announcement of the sale of a 30% stake in its Ohio utility. Valued at approximately 1.8 times the Enterprise Value/Rate Base, the deal is part of AES's broader $3.5 billion asset sale program. With this transaction, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) has divested $2.7 billion of assets since 2023, and the proceeds will be used to reduce debt at the AES Ohio holding company, which currently carries around $800 million in debt, impacting the company’s cash flow. The sale is also expected to provide equity financing for upcoming growth projects at the Ohio utility. Overall AES ranks 5th on our list of the best electric utility stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AES as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Yes, JD Vance Wrote Foreword to Book by Project 2025's Leader
URL: https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/vance-foreword-project-2025/
Time Published: 2024-11-07T23:44:00Z
Full Content:
About this rating The claim that U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance wrote the foreword to a Project 2025-linked book written by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts first spread online when President-elect Donald Trump chose Vance, a senator from Ohio, to be his Republican vice-presidential running mate in July 2024. At the time, it arose in the context of Trump's repeated denials of his connections to Project 2025 — a Heritage Foundation-led conservative initiative to reshape the American government in its own image: The claim reemerged following Trump's victory in the general election on Nov. 5, 2024, in part because the book's publisher delayed its release to occur directly after the election. The book was set to be released on Nov. 15, 2024, as of this writing. It is true that Vance wrote the foreword to this book. Roberts leads the Heritage Foundation, which describes itself as the primary organization behind Project 2025. The book has been described by publishing industry outlet Publisher's Lunch as "the book associated with the conservative organization's Project 2025 policy agenda." The book's original title was "Dawn's Early Light: Burning Down Washington To Save America," and it was set to be published in September 2024. An early publisher's description described its author as the head of Project 2025: As reported by Vox, "the book was written and announced before Vance was chosen as Trump's running mate. But there's some indication that people involved had some late second thoughts about it." In a statement about the changed publication date, Roberts said: There's a time for writing, reading, and book tours — and a time to put down the books and go fight like hell to take back our country. … That's why I've chosen to move my book's publication and promotion to after the election. The book is now titled "Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America." As described by its publisher, the themes and ideas in the book track closely with Project 2025's "mandate for America," which Snopes previously covered: Dawn's Early Light blazes a promising path for the American people to take back their country. Chapter by chapter, it identifies institutions that conservatives need to build, others that we need to take back, and more still that are too corrupt to save: Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, BlackRock, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy, to name a few. All these need to be dissolved if the American way of life is to be passed down to future generations. In July 2024, The New Republic published portions of the foreword Vance wrote from an advance copy of the book. The language, at least in that version, echoed Roberts' calls for a "second American Revolution": The old conservative movement argued if you just got government out of the way, natural forces would resolve problems. We are no longer in this situation and must take a different approach. As Kevin Roberts writes, "It's fine to take a laissez-faire approach when you are in the safety of the sunshine. But when the twilight descends and you hear the wolves, you've got to circle the wagons and load the muskets." We are now all realizing that it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon. Because Vance indeed wrote the foreword to a book written by the leader of Project 2025, we rate the claim as true.

While Disney, Budweiser, Target, and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into the C-suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That’s why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it’s auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there’s not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically, seeking to rule over others instead of empowering them to decide for themselves. They misled the public on the origin of COVID-19, the efficacy of masks, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Equating himself with “the science,” Fauci sought to silence critics, quell inquiry, and disempower people from making fully informed decisions. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similarly authoritative manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy that drives all those prevaricating pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Donald Trump and his merry band of bold critics—including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard—are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.

Moreover, only 0.28% of IBIT's Bitcoin stash was sold to cover redeemed shares since launch, indicating user retention. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) surpassed $23.3 billion in net asset value (NAV) in the third quarter, registering a 20% quarterly growth, according to a Nov. 7 to a 10-Q Form filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) holds 367,805 BTC, worth roughly $21.5 billion, with roughly $1.8 billion in unrealized profit as of Sept. 30. Additionally, since its inception, the IBIT has only sold 0.28% of its Bitcoin stash to cover share redemption, indicating high investor retention. As a result, the fund ended the third quarter with 366,448 BTC under management. The filing highlighted that the NAV growth is mainly related to a 19.8% increase in outstanding shares, rising from 539.1 million to 644 million between quarters. Outstanding shares are owned by investors and are available for trading in the secondary market. IBIT’s liabilities are nearly $4 million, which is related to the ETF’s sponsor fees. Besides that, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has not registered any expenses since January. Notably, BlackRock registered over $1.6 million in realized profit by selling BTC since its inception to cover its expenses related to sponsor fees and redeeming investors’ shares. IBIT registered two daily records on Nov. 6 after hitting $1 billion in daily trading volume within 20 minutes of the trading session. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that IBIT closed the day with $4.1 billion in trading volume, its highest since launch. However, IBIT registered its worst daily outflow on the same day, as $69.1 million left the fund. Balchunas added: “For context that’s more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second best day since launching.” Additionally, the US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $6 billion in volume, a collective record. Nevertheless, considering last week’s massive inflows, the outflows seen this week are not a cause for concern, as highlighted by a recent Glassnode report.

Kathleen Watkins President Michael D Higgins had led tributes to broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, who has died at the age of 90. Tributes have poured in for Ms Watkins this afternoon from across the world of politics, media and beyond. “It was with great sorrow that Sabina and I learned of the passing of Kathleen Watkins, we were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country. “I hope that all who loved Kathleen will be comforted by these memories, her truly remarkable legacy and her inspiring life. “As President of Ireland, may I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Kathleen Watkins, her daughters Suzy and Crona, her grandchildren and wider family.” Meanwhile, the daughter of Kathleen Watkins and Gay Byrne paid tribute to her “unbelievable” mother who passed away aged 90. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. “Her adoration for her grandchildren was renowned. When I announced to her that I was pregnant with Cian, she said at that time I will forever be known as Nana Kit now and from that day on she wouldn't answer to anything else,” said Suzy. “The children that they are, and the children that they have become, is so much down to her. She taught them their manners, she introduced them to music, she insisted that when we came back from London that they really should do speech and drama. “Her relationship with Cian, Siabh, Saoirse, Kate and Harry was phenomenal and they have benefited from her interest in them and her education of them”, she added. Ms Watkins was described by long term friend Maire-Louise O’Donnell as “possibly one of the most cultured people". Ms O’Donnell said she was always interested in culture, from theatre and film to poetry and language and in young people who were writing, singing and in the media. “She was very much a renaissance woman,” Ms O’Donnell said. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. In later years, Ms Watkins wrote a series of children’s books about a piglet character called Pigín, which won an Irish Book Award. In her final interview, with Sunday Independent journalist Barry Egan last September, Ms Watkins spoke openly about her life in the wake of her husband’s death and revealed that he had made plans for her funeral. She said she had picked the music and the prayers already. Speaking about the music, she said: “I have an idea but I won’t say. I would like Frank McNamara to be in charge of that. He was the musical director of The Late Late. He will know exactly what to do. I will leave instructions.” Taoiseach Simon Harris paid tribute to Ms Watkins in a statement this afternoon. "It is with great sadness that I have learned of the death of broadcaster and author Kathleen Watkins,” Mr Harris said. “Kathleen was a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “She was multi-talented in her own right, and indeed like many households around the country, her books and Pigín have a special place on the bookcase in my home. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss. “May she rest in peace.” Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl led tributes in the Dáil to Ms Watkins in the Dáil, describing her as a “national treasure.” She was “an inspiration to many to people of his generation”, he said.

Title: DoubleVerify Won 70% Of The Former Moat Advertisers It Courted

Moat, ya basic. Well, ya were basic, at least according to DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski. “One thing we did note is that Moat had a pretty basic product,” Zagorski said on Wednesday during the company’s Q3 earnings call in response to an investor asking for more detail on the Oracle opportunity. In September, Oracle shut down all of its advertising products and services, including brand safety and verification provider Moat, leaving Moat’s former advertiser clients ripe for the pitching. Both DV and Integral Ad Science have been in pitchapalooza mode since June, when Oracle first announced, rather abruptly, that it would exit the advertising business. According to Zagorski, DoubleVerify has won 70% of the Moat advertiser RFPs it’s participated in, including P&G, BlackRock, Dish Network, Charter, Dunkin’ parent company Inspire Brands, Kellogg’s and Google. Slow burn But this was “no normal RFP process,” Zagorski said. An RFP usually takes between three and six months, sometimes even longer if a client wants to run tests and do a deep dive into the technology. But here, with so little time between Oracle’s original announcement and when it planned to actually pull the plug, the process was condensed into roughly six weeks. “In many cases, it was very aggressive technical due diligence plus, you know, getting your best price out there,” Zagorski said. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. In other words, DV knew it had to be “really, really forward” on its pricing, he said. These client wins are flashy and have promise, in other words, but they won’t benefit the bottom line in a big way right away, said CFO Nicola Allais. “The full revenue impact of these opportunities will materialize over a long period,” Allais said, “typically between one to three years of onboarding through our ability to upsell our social and activation solutions.” The upsell (eventually) Attention measurement, social media measurement and social activation are all top priorities for DV to expand beyond verification and brand safety to also include performance solutions. Scibids, the AI startup DV acquired for $125 million last summer, is key to that plan. Today, 15 of DoubleVerify’s top 100 customers use Scibids to optimize programmatic bids across platforms, and DV has been able to upsell Scibids to nearly 50 total customers, Zagorski said. He added that Scibids is on pace to generate $100 million in revenue by 2028. Scibids is DV’s “core investment” on the performance side, he said, and “we’re going to start leaning into and pushing it into other parts of our business.” Presumably, DV will also eventually upsell Scibids to its newly wooed former Moat clients. But DV’s nearer-term goal is to become more than just a like-for-like replacement for Moat. “Moat didn’t do social; Moat didn’t have a very robust, dynamic pre-bid suitability product,” Zagorski said. “These are sophisticated advertisers – they’re big spenders – and I think there’s a big opportunity for us down the road.”

Title: JPMorgan Rebrands Blockchain Division from ‘Onyx’ to ‘Kinexys’ and Unveils New Features

Photo Credit: Facebook/ JP Morgan With Kinexys, we’re building on the momentum of Onyx, the bank said JPMorgan is expanding its alliance with blockchain technology. In a recent development, the US-based bank said it has rebranded its blockchain unit, originally launched as ‘Onyx', to ‘Kinexys' to signify its operational roadmap for Web3 adoption. The rebranding brings along an array of new financial products and services with blockchain at the centre. This development follows JPMorgan's intensified exploration into Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. Expanding on the rebranding, the bank explained that the name ‘Kinexys' is derived from the word ‘kinetic,' meaning ‘caused by motion.' “This is representative of the way we move money, assets and financial information around the world with speed, ease and efficiency. Together with our clients, we aim to move beyond the limitations of legacy technology and realise the promise of a multichain world,” Umar Farooq, co-head of JPMorgan Payments said in a statement. As of November 2024, JPMorgan's market cap is reportedly ₹58.517 trillion (roughly $ 693.5 billion), making it the world's 13th most valuable company by market cap. In its statement, the bank asserted that integrating blockchain into its systems has established a secure infrastructure for clients to transfer cross-border funds seamlessly, even outside of traditional market hours, while also enabling new services related to RWA tokenisation. “Soon, we'll be adding foreign exchange (FX) capabilities to Kinexys Digital Payments (formerly JPM Coin System). We've also announced a proof-of-concept (POC) from Kinexys Digital Assets and Kinexys Labs. This POC demonstrates on-chain privacy, identity and composability—major themes that will play significantly into our continued evolution,” the statement announced. Over the past two years, JPMorgan's Onyx initiative has attracted prominent institutional clients, including Siemens, Ant International, and BlackRock. As per company figures, Onyx managed to exceed $1.5 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,26,55,856 crore) in notional value, processing an average daily transaction volume of over $2 billion. “We're furthering our exploration of privacy, identity and composability in blockchain ecosystems. nhanced privacy measures are crucial for improving access to digital assets, while streamlining identity management is intrinsically linked to the potential for tokenised assets at scale,” JPMorgan noted. Beyond blockchain, the New York City-based bank is also exploring other Web3 technologies. Despite a slowdown in the metaverse sector, the bank announced last December that it was looking forward to test the ‘immersive training applications' of metaverse. In May 2022, the bank predicted that as regulatory oversight of crypto assets grows, they will eventually integrate with traditional finance. That same year, the bank also explored launching a crypto wallet service to address emerging market demands.

With major players eyeing Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict even greater demand for platforms like Coinbase. In a remarkable turnaround, Coinbase [COIN] stock has experienced a significant surge, coinciding with the latest upswing in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts attribute this growth to several positive factors within the digital assets space. Coinbase stock is up by over 15% as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies rally. Bitcoin recently reached new highs, while Ether and other leading assets have similarly appreciated. “This price movement brings renewed optimism and signals resilience in the market,” said Jaret Seiberg, financial analyst at Cowen. With Bitcoin hovering around $70,000, some analysts see this as a pivotal turning point. The broader trend highlights an increasing interest from institutional investors, who play a crucial role in stabilizing the crypto market. COIN’s stock has benefited directly from this, as many investors see it as a gateway to crypto exposure. Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have recently shown interest in launching Bitcoin ETFs, which could make crypto assets more accessible to the public. This growing support has elevated investor confidence in Coinbase as a leading exchange. According to Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho, “Coinbase’s value goes beyond trading; it has become a household name for accessing crypto investments.” The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could provide a significant advantage for Coinbase, positioning it as a key player in the ecosystem. “If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, it will likely drive a substantial volume to platforms like Coinbase,” said Owen Lau, an analyst with Oppenheimer. Lau added that the resulting liquidity could lead to increased revenue for Coinbase. The rally in Coinbase stock has sent a positive signal across the broader cryptocurrency and fintech industries. The growth of regulated, accessible platforms like Coinbase is viewed as vital for mainstream adoption. Analysts argue that Coinbase’s success may prompt similar companies to explore public offerings, increasing transparency and trust in the industry. Additionally, Coinbase’s recent rally could also encourage more people to participate in crypto markets, leading to an increased demand for digital assets. This aligns with the long-term vision of the company, which aims to make crypto universally accessible. “More people in the market increases liquidity, and that’s positive for everyone involved,” noted Seiberg. Coinbase’s stock price gains underscore the market’s anticipation of future growth within the crypto sector. As Coinbase remains a trusted entry point for many, its success reflects the rising demand for crypto investments. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 With ETFs and institutional backing likely to grow, the platform may see continued benefits from crypto’s bullish wave. The Coinbase surge highlights how traditional finance and crypto increasingly intersect, creating new avenues for both industries to thrive.

Title: Bitcoin Registers Fourth-Best Day of 2024 as BlackRock ETF Posts Record Volume

Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) posted its fourth-best day of the year on Wednesday following the U.S. presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who voiced support for the crypto industry during his campaign. The largest cryptocurrency by market value climbed more than 9% to hit a record $76,481, CoinDesk Indices data show. It hit 9.7% at the end of February, during a rally that took it to the previous high in March, gained 10% after dropping from that high and added 12% after the Aug. 5 yen carry trade unwind. While Wednesday's swing may concern investors who think the gain is unsustainable, earlier research indicated BTC could rise 11% on a Trump victory. The rally coincided with massive inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which added a net $621.9 million, according to Farside data. The flow, one of the highest figures since the products' introduction in January, snapped a three-day streak of outflows. Total net inflows have now reached $24.2 billion. Among notable performances, Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) registered $108.8 million, its second-biggest day since the start of trading. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw a $100.9 million inflow, also one of its biggest net inflow days. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in contrast, posted a second-straight day of net outflows, losing a total of $113.3 million over the period. Trading volume in the ETF was at a record level, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. "IBIT just had its biggest volume day ever with $4.1b traded," Balchunas wrote. "That's more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second-best day since launching, some of this will convert into inflows". Overall, "the group of bitcoin ETFs did $6b, their best day since the crazy early days. Most of the ETFs did 2x their average. It was just an all-around banger day for an infant category that never ceases to amaze," he wrote. To provide some historical context, ETF trade volume reached a $9.9 billion peak during the March bull run, according to data from checkonchain. Total trade volume on Nov. 6 reached approximately $76 billion, comprising futures volume of $62 billion, spot volume of $8 billion and ETF trade volume of $6 billion, so ETF trade volume is still a small percentage of the total. Ether (ETH) is lagging behind bitcoin's 2024 performance. Net inflows into ether U.S. spot ETFs totaled $52.3 million, the most since Sept. 27, according to Farside data. As of press time, bitcoin is trading at just over $75,000, up 77% year-to-date, while ether is trading at $2,822, up 20% year-to-date. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Title: Trump Wins Because He’s Just Better

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2024 2:48:24 AM PST by RoosterRedux Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America – media, academia, and big business, too – not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. ... Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. ... [N]early all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. ... And it’s not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. ... The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated...? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target, and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers.

Fidelity's FBTC captures $308.8 million as BlackRock's IBIT sees $69.1 million outflow. Major asset management firms reported significant inflows in their Bitcoin ETFs following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. On Nov. 6, Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $308.8 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT experienced an outflow of $69.1 million. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC recorded an inflow of $30.9 million and $108 million, respectively, reversing previous outflows. Bitcoin’s price surged to a new all-time high of $76,400, breaking its previous record twice since the election. This price increase coincided with the substantial ETF inflows, suggesting renewed institutional interest. Ark’s ARKB reported an inflow of $127 million, and Bitwise’s BITB gained $100.9 million on the same day. The shifts in ETF holdings reflect a complex market response. Companies like Valkyrie and VanEck also reported changes in their Bitcoin ETF positions. Valkyrie’s BRRR had a slight outflow of $2.6 million, while VanEck’s HODL saw an inflow of $17.2 million.

Title: BlackRock records largest single-day outflow, but Bitcoin ETFs still post $622 million gains

Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted approximately $622 million in net inflows on November 6, ending a three-day losing streak, despite BlackRock’s IBIT experiencing its largest single-day outflow since launch. According to data from Farside Investors, the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF recorded around $69 million in net outflows yesterday, while Valkyrie’s BRRR saw over $2 million in outflows. IBIT’s loss came as a surprise given that the fund started strong with over $1 billion in shares traded within the first 20 minutes of market opening. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT achieved its highest trading-volume day, reaching $4.1 billion. “For context, that’s more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today,” the analyst said. “It was also up 10%, its second best day since launching. Some of this will convert into inflows likely hitting Tue, Wed night.” However, he previously noted that considerable buying and selling activity did not translate into new investments or capital inflows into the ETF, meaning that high volume can result from both purchases and sales. Most ETFs traded at double their average volume, marking one of their best trading days since January’s initial launch period, Balchunas stated in a follow-up post. On Wednesday, Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with nearly $309 million in net buying, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB, which took in roughly $127 million. Major gains were also seen in Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB. The low-cost version of GBTC recorded nearly $109 million in new capital, its second-largest daily inflow since launch. Meanwhile, the BITB fund logged around $101 million, its best single-day performance since mid-February. Grayscale’s GBTC reported approximately $31 million in net inflows yesterday, while VanEck’s HODL saw around $17 million. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Experiences Sixth Day of Outflows Amid US Elections

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now seen six days of net outflows since its launch in January. This means more money has been withdrawn than those added on those days. On November 5, US election day, institutional investors seemed to play it safe, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recording $44.2 million in net outflows, according to CoinGlass data. This outflow marked IBIT’s sixth negative flow since its launch in January. The last outflow was on October 10, when $10.8 million exited the fund. Altogether, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw 116.8 million in net outflows. The largest outflow was from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which saw $68.2 million taken out. The only fund with new inflow for the day was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which had $19.3 million added to it. This marked the third consecutive day of net outflows for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The previous day, November 4, the 11 Bitcoin funds had their second-biggest outflow ever, with over $541.1 million withdrawn. After the US trading day ended, the spot crypto markets saw a big surge. This happened as election results started coming in, with Bitcoin price reaching a new all-time high of $75,000. Henrik Anderson, the chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto, explained that Bitcoin has become a key focus for traders worldwide. He called it the “election trade,” meaning that many investors are now looking to Bitcoin during the election period, hoping for gains. He looked at betting markets and traditional sources to estimate the chances of Donald Trump winning. Based on this information, Henrik figured there was an 80% to 90% chance that Trump would win. Henrik also said that Bitcoin seems to be following this trend. Bitcoin is already above $74,000, and he believes it may have already made most of its price move for now. If Trump wins, he predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This is based on the idea that Trump’s victory would continue to boost Bitcoin’s price. In a blog post, Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store, shared his thoughts on how elections affect investments. He said that people often exaggerate how much elections impact the market. He pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership plays a much more significant role. The SEC is responsible for making investment rules and regulations, which often impact market sentiment. Geraci believes that the regulatory environment, especially those who lead the SEC, can significantly affect ETFs’ development and innovation. The SEC’s decision can either help or slow down new ideas in the ETF market. He also mentioned that no one knows what will happen with the situation. There are many unknowns, and it’s hard to predict the exact outcome. However, Geraci believes the best long-term solution would be to create a clear and balanced set of rules for crypto. This would require cooperation between the two major political parties to develop a framework that works for everyone. Still, he thinks it’s very likely that the results of this election will impact how quickly new crypto ETFs are developed.

Title: After Trump Win, Bernie Sanders Blames Democrats for Abandoning Working People
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/bernie-sanders-shawn-fain-democrats-trump
Time Published: 2024-11-07T03:55:00Z

Shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders forcefully called out Democratic Party leadership for losing The White House and at least one chamber of Congress to Republicans. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. ​“First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well.” “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,” said the senator, who decisively won reelection on Tuesday as Republicans reclaimed the upper chamber. ​“And they’re right.” After seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, Sanders spent this cycle campaigning for Harris, warning of Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s return, blasting billionaire involvement in U.S. politics, and urging Democrats to better serve working people. In Sanders’ new statement, he highlighted U.S. income and wealth inequality, worker concerns about artificial intelligence, and the federal government’s failure to provide paid leave and universal healthcare while pouring billions of dollars into Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. “Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful oligarchy which has so much economic and political power?” he asked. ​“Probably not.”​“In the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions,” Sanders concluded. ​“Stay tuned.” Progressives — who have responded to Trump’s Electoral College and popular vote win by criticizing billionaires who backed him and promising ​“unprecedented resistance” during his second term — echoed Sanders’ remarks. Sharing Sanders’ statement on X — the social media platform owned by billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk — United Auto Workers (UAW) communications director Jonah Furman said: ​“The task has been clear for a decade. The question is only whether and when we will rise to the task.” Separately, the union’s president, Shawn Fain, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“UAW members around the country clocked in today under the same threat they faced yesterday: unchecked corporate greed destroying our lives, our families, and our communities.” “We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same,” Fain continued, pointing to the battle against ​“broken trade laws” like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and fights for good union jobs, a secure retirement for everyone, a living wage, affordable healthcare, and time for families. “It’s time for Washington, D.C. to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate,” added Fain, whose union endorsed Harris. ​“Will our government stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires? That’s the question we face today. And that’s the question we’ll face tomorrow. The answer lies with us. No matter who’s in office.” In a post-election column, Chuck Idelson, former communications senior strategist for National Nurses United, made the case that ​“amid the postmortems and reckoning that will now follow the wreckage of Donald Trump’s return to ​‘absolute’ power, as authorized by the Supreme Court, there are … two notes in particular that deserve a deeper dive.” “In Missouri, a state Trump won by 58%, voters also acted to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour and to require employers to provide paid sick leave to workers,” he pointed out. ​“In Nebraska, another red state won by Trump, voters also passed a paid sick leave measure, Initiative 436, by 75%.” In addition to the ballot measures, Idelson highlighted that ​“in the multitude of exit poll results, one particularly stands out — 94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump, the exact same percentage he received in 2020. The heavy campaign focus on pulling away Republican voters from Trump turned out to be a pipe dream. The old cliché ​‘it’s the economy stupid,’ triumphed again.” Harris’ campaign, he argued, ​“reflected the direction the Democratic Party establishment has taken, away from working-class issues since the advent of neoliberal policies in the 1970s and carried out by most Democratic Party presidents since.” Historian Harvey J. Kaye, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, took aim at the Democratic Party on social media Wednesday, noting failures to stand up to billionaires, raise the minimum wage, and pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“a self-avowed authoritarian successfully wielded the economic frustrations of millions to win the most consequential election of our nation’s history. The Democratic establishment has only itself to blame.” “Voters demanded a fundamental overhaul of a rigged economic system. When neoliberal Democrats dithered, Donald Trump offered to clear the board, and voters chose the dark unknown rather than the status quo,” Pearl added. ​“The only question remaining is, why are Democrats surprised? This is the entirely predictable result of a multi-decade strategy to appease the rich that met no serious resistance.” The Sunrise Movement — a youth-led climate group that worked to reach millions of young voters in swing states to defeat Trump — similarly stressed on social media Wednesday that ​“last night’s results were a call for change. Millions of people are fed up after living through decades of a rigged economy and corrupt political system. They are looking for someone to blame. It’s critical the Dem Party takes that seriously.” “For decades, Democrats have prioritized corporations over people. This is the result. Every working American feels the crisis. We can’t pay rent. Our government can’t pass basic legislation. The WEATHER has turned against us. And Dems look us in the eye and say it’s fine,” the group continued. ​“Trump loves corporations even more than Democrats do, but he ran an anti-establishment campaign that gave an answer to people’s desire for change.” “We can stop him, and we must,” Sunrise said of Trump. ​“But it’s going to take many thousands of people taking to the streets and preparing to strike. And it’s going to take mass movements putting out a better vision for our country than Trumpism and proving that we can make it happen.” This article was originally published by Common Dreams.

Title: Bitcoin surges as backers bet Donald Trump’s election will bring crypto into the mainstream

Photo: Getty Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. The largest digital asset rose as much as 9pc to $75,372 (€70,391) as early results showed Mr Trump barrelling towards a win. It traded at just below $74,000 as of 10:40am yesterday morning as networks declared Mr Trump had won the race, setting him up for a second term in the White House. The last peak was in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Mr Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Ms Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. Donald Trump holds hands with former first lady Melania Trump after speaking to supporters in West Palm Beach (Lynne Sladky/AP) "The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end," said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. "People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto." In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Crypto titans spent some $40m to defeat Mr Brown – a long-time sceptic of the industry – underlining the influence of their political outlays. The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 8pc. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31pc at one point. Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX exchange. "The first test of [Trump’s] credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office," said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced 75pc in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5bn of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year – among the most successful new ETFs in history.

BREAKING: Germany’s three-party ruling coalition collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced he would fire his Finance Minister Christian Lindner over persistent disagreements about economic reforms.

Hearing some things are afoot in New Zealand too. What a horrible day. It's not a full on government collapse like Germany, but it does sound concerningly right wing https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/new-zealand-treaty-of-waitangi-founding-document-changes-bill-parliament And people want us to have hope for the world. How? Genuinely how? florence + the machine really weren't lying when she sang "i'm always in this twilight" I had a genuine thought today when I went out to the orthodontist and to get cat food and saw people with Trump flags on their cars and wearing all their MAGA merch that maybe it's time to get a gun, especially since my pit bull died and she did a damned good job of being threatening to anyone looking the wrong way at my house. That's the mental state I'm in right now, especially since I live in a rural part of the south (albeit NC which needs to figure out if they're Republican or Democrat because elected Trump and then Democrats for statewide office ???). I'm thinking of all the women opting out of dating/marrying/sleeping with men (I'm never letting one of those filthy devils touch me ever again) and the potential increase of SA from frustrated men. I'm def considering a gun. Ugh we really are living in a repeat of the 1920s/30s. Lindner was basically blocking every good idea the Dems/Greens had and only thought about himself and his rich party friends. He always had the least support in the polls but acted like HE was the leader. Basically a toddler, "if it doesn't go my way I'm not doing it".This was probably the outcome he wanted because he was already cuddling with the conservatives the past months. He's hoping that he will somehow make it in the parliament again next election and can form a coalition with them. Lindner is an ass and intentionally sabotaged the whole thing from the start. He wants to be part of the government but he also wants to be the one who is in charge which he obviously wouldn't be as the smallest partner in a coalition of 3 parties. So he's also playing opposition to his own coalition and basically keeping them hostage every time they have to figure out the finances. And now we've reached the point where SPD and Greens had enough. Scholz gave a speech that was a basically a big "fuck this guy!" explaining why he fired him for the good of the country. I guess it's now because we'd have elections next year anyway and the proposed timeline would only move things forward 6 months. I think in a way it's also a bit of a last-ditch effort to save face for Scholz, because he was a pretty weak leader. The coalition definitely struggled thanks to Lindner, but Scholz didn't do anyone any favours by not reigning him in earlier.

Title: Neuralink Rival Precision Neuroscience Raises $93 Million

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Precision Neuroscience Corp., a brain implant rival to Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp., has raised $93 million of a planned $100 million funding round, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal valued the startup at about $500 million. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The fresh fundraising gives the company a boost as it seeks to take on Neuralink, which has raised over $685 million, and other companies in the space including Science, which has raised $150 million. A spokeswoman for Precision declined to comment. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows the company had filed to raise as much as $150 million. Precision was founded in 2021 by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport, a co-founder of Neuralink, and Chief Executive Officer Michael Mager. Last year, it raised $41 million. Startups working on brain implants and related technology, or brain-machine interfaces, have gained considerable momentum in recent months. Neuralink’s device went into its first human patient as part of a trial earlier this year. And a team at the University of California, Davis, implanted an ALS patient with a device that allowed him to speak via a machine with unprecedented accuracy by reading his brain signals. Precision’s device is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, referring to the six layers that comprise the cerebral cortex, and represents a compromise between invasive and noninvasive brain-computer interface technologies. It requires surgery and slicing into the skull, but not into the tissue of the brain. Instead, the device sits on top of the organ, a method the company says avoids damaging any of that brain’s tissue. That’s a contrast with devices from companies including Blackrock Neurotech, Inbrain Neuroelectronics SL, Neuralink and Paradromics, which sit within brain tissue. A device from Synchron enters the brain like a stent, via blood vessels, and ultimately sits near the brain’s motor cortex. Another company, Science, says it’s working on devices that can sit both on or in brain tissue. Precision’s device is not yet greenlit by regulators, but it is in testing. The startup has implanted its device in several patients, albeit temporarily during surgeries, where the primary purpose was related to another goal, such as removing brain tumors. While the surgery is underway and with the patient’s permission, the Precision team puts its Layer 7 in place and uses it to detect neurological signals. The company has applied for Food and Drug Administration approval of a version of its device for temporary use for monitoring in hospital settings, and has said it hopes to have it on the market next year. That would provide a revenue stream to the fledgling company as it works on its other device: a permanent implant to treat paralysis. Such a device, if it works, is years from approval and commercial deployment. In a recent surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, Precision tested placing four of its microelectrode arrays — each one-fifth the thickness of a human hair — on the surface of a patient brain. Each array contains 1,024 electrodes, so deploying four arrays gives a total of 4,096, creating an unusually high level of detail. Competitors have far fewer. Neuralink’s device, for example, has 1,024 electrodes.

Title: The Future Of Brain-Computer Interfaces Emerges At Mount Sinai

Last week I had the privilege to attend the inaugural New York BCI Symposium, a one-of-a-kind gathering that validated the astonishing popular appeal of BCI by spotlighting the field’s future opportunities and present-day limitations. The heady lineup featured over thirty experts including researchers, neurosurgeons, founders, advocates, and federal leaders, drawing a packed house of attendees spanning students, clinicians, investors and executives from around the world. Aligned in our common curiosity and interests, we mingled and traded perspectives on all things BCI. The two-day event was co-hosted by Mount Sinai BioDesign and the Department of Neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Presentations spanned key discussions in breakthrough methods, commercial strategy, ethics, and research initiatives. Speakers represented numerous programs from Mount Sinai’s network of interdisciplinary departments for brain health, suggesting that the world’s leading neurotech innovation ecosystem might be developing at New York City’s biggest hospital system. Mount Sinai Health System's world-class neurotech ecosystem is foundational for the future of BCI. But the hosts transcended an empire state of mind, inviting experts from competing New York hospitals, and brain trusts from Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, London, and the Netherlands. Such cross-pollination has been essential to the BCI field thus far, and serves as a testament to the collegial leadership of Dr. Joshua Bederson. As the system chair of neurosurgery and executive director of the biodesign program at Mount Sinai, Bederson’s earnest emceeing centered humility over hype and set the tone for two days of collaborative learning and discussion. The two BCI sponsors of the event, Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, offered dual visions of what an “interface” can be across numerous sessions. Synchron’s strategy bets on speed over size. Their minimally invasive Stentrode, whose endovascular insertion time is down to just 20 minutes, reliably translates signals into digital motor outputs to navigate a growing ecosystem of applications. Despite a relatively modest 16-channel array, Synchron’s focus on pragmatism and execution has garnered valuable respect and mindshare among neurosurgeons, federal officials, and the investor community. As an earlier stage company, Precision has chosen to optimize for the future over the immediate-term. Their “Layer 7” thin film array has 1024 electrodes in a flexible device that conforms to the cortex. While it has only been used in exploratory studies thus far, implantations will occur via a <1mm incision; once made the “micro-electrocorticography” array (micro-ECoG) will take about 20 seconds to place. The ability to record and stimulate at a field-leading volume will take longer to arrive in market, but likely offer greater options to build value for users when it does. Precision Neuroscience and Synchron anchored the symposium as sponsors Here are my top five sessions (actually, seven) focused on the most critical characters in the evolving narrative about BCI’s future: Brain health experts who founded companies to translate research and transform practice, and the early group of end users who’ve had actual skin in the game, known and celebrated as BCI Pioneers. Doug Weber, co-director at the NeuroMechatronics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University set the stage. His “why, what, how” history of major BCI milestones unfolded through six Pioneers’ stories, starting in 1996 with Marjorie Hirschberg, and continuing with with Phil Kennedy, Matt Nagle, Jan Scheurmann and Ian Burkhart, before stopping in 2015 with Nathan Copeland, who remains the world’s longest actively implanted (and most artistically prolific) user. Doug Weber from Carnegie Mellon kicked off the Symposium with an overview of BCI Pioneers and key ... [+] milestones. Weber also leveraged his broad industry experience as co-founder and CTO of Reach Neuro and advisor to numerous neurotech startups to frame two major challenges: First is accurately defining the market, which will involve validating and benchmarking outcomes against current alternatives for end users. Second is the umbrella of ethical, legal, social implications (ELSI) posed by real world adoption. This spans a diverse, cross-functional, and challenging mix of topics including data and device security, user agency, accessibility, equitability, policy reforms and more. While digital device control, a primarily “read” use case, remains the first focal area for most commercial BCI, efficacy trials are still needed “to understand where specific benefits are, and how uniform they are across a population,” which payers will require for reimbursement considerations. Weber also spoke to movement disorders, mental illness, and stroke recovery as expansion markets that could combine BCI with neuromodulation (“write.”) Across subsequent tracks, it became evident that the post-research, read-and-write future of BCI is not that far away. Chad Bouton, a professor and VP of Advanced Engineering at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes, presented a case study on “neural bypass.” This procedure pairs spinal cord stimulation and BCI to produce cortical mirroring around the site of injury. By exciting or “priming” the spinal cord, this approach can create enough neural plasticity to restore limited sensations, and enhance physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve strength and motor control for people who have lost independence through injury. Today, this remains a research effort requiring highly personalized surgical interventions and rehabilitation, rather than any off-the-shelf options. In response to a question about where neural bypasses will be in five years, Bouton emphasized his lab’s research focus to “promote plasticity any way we can” and the need for a commercial ecosystem of wearable stimulation with onboard AI that can pair with BCI systems and work from users’ homes. The subject of Bouton’s case study, Keith Thomas, who became paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident, was in the room with his sister to receive a rousing round of applause. In a brief chat with Bouton, Thomas and his sister after the session, I was moved by the trio’s banter and the depth of their connection, and grateful for the siblings’ candid input when asked how BCI could better serve users and caregivers today. I’ll explore this critical topic in future articles. David Putrino, PhD, a professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, opened this session with an overview of his lab’s approach to “rehabilitation and human performance.” This involves partnering with patients to adopt and adapt various neurotechnologies as part of active treatment, as well as working with regulatory agencies and payors to promote patient access outside of research settings. Putrino contrasted the impairment-focused medical model of disability with the social model, which works to remove or mitigate barriers to human performance. In this frame, BCI is arriving at a crossroads moment, wherein innovation is expanding from compensation (e.g. water bottle grippers for people without finger control) to restoration through things like functional electrical stimulation. He was joined on the stage by Christopher Kellner, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery who oversees various programs in care delivery, research, and training in the field of intracerebral care. Kellner’s work entails use of numerous FDA-cleared neurotechnologies, from implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation, to wearable sleeves paired with a non-invasive brain interface. David Putrino and Christopher Kellner's cross-functional, interdisciplinary collaboration spanning ... [+] neurotech, neurosurgery, PT & Rehab, and arm-wrestling insurers has helped patients like Katie regain functional independence after a stroke. The highlight of the track was hearing from a patient named Katie, who worked with both Kellner and Putrino to regain independence after a devastating stroke in 2019 left her paralyzed down her left side. Only in her early 30’s with a two year old at home, Katie was hospitalized for five months during the Covid-19 pandemic, which involved intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy, which helped but still left her with limited arm strength at discharge. After two years of haggling with three different insurers, Katie gained access to Medicare which enabled her to join Kellner’s trial for a vagus nerve stimulation implant. She described the surgery as “not bad,” the six weeks of additional rehab as “you get out what you put in,” and the treatment as “life-changing,” adding that “you can feel your brain rewiring, you can feel the neuroplasticity.” With her young daughter in the audience watching her mom on stage, Katie’s story represents both the possibilities of neurotech-enabled stroke care today, and the fiendish limitations too many Americans face from their health plans. It struck that Mount Sinai’s collaborative, interdisciplinary, tech-savvy, and practically oriented clinical model remains an exception rather than a norm compared to most health systems. The only thing better than watching videos of BCI Pioneers bending and breaking limits - speaking cybernetically, fistbumping presidents, playing games, making art - is hearing from them directly. Ian Burkhart took the stage numerous times to share his expert perspective as a liaison to the FDA, President of NASIC, philanthropic leader, published researcher, and all around advocate. In a chat with CNBC’s Ashley Capoot, he shared the story of his spinal cord injury and his clinical trial in 2014 that implanted him with a Blackrock Neuroport array. Seven years of clinical studies included a neural bypass procedure using technology from Battelle that temporarily reanimated his hand well enough to play Guitar Hero. In 2021, Burkhart was “explanted” when the trial’s funding ran out and a scalp infection developed around his implant. His perspective is that BCI represents an aspiration to deliver improvements over today’s available assistive technologies. When asked about wanting another BCI, he didn’t hesitate to say yes, but demurred that his eligibility remains in question due to prior history, and that now, “the bar is higher for what I would want.” At the top of his list are a fully implanted device to reduce odds of infection, a duration of at least ten years, and in-home functionality rather than limited access in the lab. Ian Burkhart & Ashley Capoot of CNBC spoke about how BCI can evolve from a research domain to a ... [+] field of patient care In another session, Burkhart joined Blair Casey, executive director of Team Gleason, and Jennifer French, MBA, for a nuanced discussion on the path forward in BCI. French lives with tetraplegia as a result of a snowboarding accident, and the extent of her neurotechnology advocacy and leadership cannot be understated. Her expertise founding and leading Neurotech Network, NASIC, and the iBCI-CC over the last decade were on display in a masterclass on pre-commercial strategy for the nascent BCI industry, from trust-building and hype mitigation, to functional indication roadmaps for people living with spinal cord injuries, to scaling community engagement for participation in clinical trials. Selling false hope about complete recovery and restoration via BCI should be avoided by all, and especially by my peers who work in media, marketing, and market research. Key trends for the industry to navigate include shrinking rehab times for spinal cord injury, low clinician awareness and access to new tech, and the need to “jump the chasm” from engaging people enrolled in BCI registries to engaging the broader community of those affected. Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science Corp, shared their vision restoration pivotal trial, in which a photovoltaic stimulating array implanted at the back of blind patients’ retinas, paired with special eyeglasses, restored the ability to see for the vast majority of the trial’s 38 participants. The implant, acquired in a commercial chess move this spring, is a solar-powered marvel the size of confetti that fits perfectly over Abe Lincoln on a penny’s tail. Through the company’s foundry and a new full stack of BCI tools, Science could bring the cost of in-human BCI development down by a factor of 20. Hodak’s broader vision for BCI is grounded yet groundbreaking. Hodak was joined on the stage by Precision Neuroscience’s CSO Ben Rapoport, Synchron’s CEO Tom Oxley, Blackrock Neurotech’s CSO Florian Solzbacher, Paradromics’ CSO Vikash Gilja and and Meta’s (formerly co- founder of CTRL-Labs) Patrick Kaifosh. Moderated by Bloomberg Reporter Sarah McBride, the discussion covered a number of emerging industry tensions: standardizing outputs from differentiated systems, collaboration versus competition, demonstrating value to patients versus payors, and prioritizing technical optimization versus real world pragmatism in allocating limited time and money. Regulatory strategy, payer and clinician engagement, and AI filled a bulk of the Q&A. The diversity of technologies, form factors, invasiveness, user base and other factors limited the depth and generalizability of this conversation, but two key themes emerged: the need to focus on effective productization over technical perfection, and the tailored approach to designing clinical outcomes. The latter will make standardization in this nascent industry a challenge (more on that below.) In conversation on AI’s role in BCI, participants summarized technical advances in ML for signal processing or deep learning for chip design, as well as generative AI. LLMs can match or mimic the “art of human expression” as part of a product, or speed up the pdf-laden burdens of regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and other mission-critical operational obligations in building a class III medical device company. Based on the brainpower and leadership on this stage, the future of the industry appears in good hands. From left to right: Sarah McBride (Bloomberg), Ben Rapoport (Precision), Tom Oxley (Synchron), ... [+] Florian Solzbacher (Blackrock), Vikash Gilja (Paradromics), Patrick Kaifosh (CTRL Labs/Meta), Max Hodak (Science) Many if not most of the sessions I attended began by summarizing BCI history, underscoring the robust foundation of knowledge, tools, and practice that clinical researchers have built for the last two decades. But even as scores of brilliant neuroengineers advance technical innovations and test experimental interventions in research settings, the various experts on stage echoed the plain view that industry is the engine that will drive this field forward for the next two decades, for better or for worse. The BCI Industrial Revolution is Underway (from Doug Weber's opening session) This set up the billion dollar question: What will the future hold for BCI startups? According to investors, it’s actually hundreds of billions. Alex Morgan, partner at Khosla Ventures and investor in Synchron and other neurotech startups, framed the opportunity as an unprecedented convergence of historic advances in measurement, materials and other technologies, from AI to AR and much in between. In a later session, Dr. Benjamin Rapoport of Precision Neuroscience referred to this confluent phenomenon as “Moore’s Law for Applied Neuroscience,” with a growth curve mapping electrode channel count over the last 50 years. In Morgan’s words, BCI (and other non-implanted neurotech) “will give us a fine-grained attenuation of the electrical network in the manner we want, when we want.” Thus, he argued, if the 20th century was the century of the heart, where a similar multi-faceted revolution in cardiology innovation now “creates over $300b in value a year” by augmenting lifespan and healthspan, then the 21st century will belong to the brain. But as we enter the second quarter of the century, the BCI industry today has yet to put any points on the board, in terms of adding economic value to people’s lives. Khosla Ventures' Alex Morgan framed the convergence of neurotechnology innovation as the Century of ... [+] the Brain. One attendee I met at lunch smirked that BCI appears to be a solution looking for a problem, a view plenty of others share. I’ve personally met or heard from too many BCI Pioneers to agree. His point was well-taken though, that reimbursement is hard, and navigating the market opportunity comes down to a specific (if daunting) set of “known unknowns” that emerged over the two days. A mentor of mine, Dr. Jordan Shlain, cautions against mistaking a clear view for a short distance. Simply put, the road ahead will be hard. Advancing the field of BCI will depend on several factors that emerged over multiple sessions, as well as the new reality of highly unpredictable federal leadership, whose impact over the next four years at FDA, CMS, and other agencies remains to be seen. As per David McMullen, the FDA’s director of the office of neurological & physical medicine devices, regulatory science at the agency entails “developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety and performance of the products it regulates.” His new boss, Michele Tarver, has a history of patient-centered public-private partnerships. McMullen divulged his career-long interest in BCI prior to joining the feds and listed numerous efforts underway to engage BCI stakeholders and, in particular, accelerate market success through TAP (“FDA Breakthrough on steroids”), specific funding mechanisms, and aligning COA. Jen French also identified informing regulatory science as a key goal of the iBCI-CC, describing the group’s work as a “pre-competitive sandbox” to develop technical and clinical standards, user preferences, endpoints economic analysis. These efforts are bolstered by the work of researchers like Abbey Sawyer, a postdoctoral fellow who shared her work in developing digital “activities of daily living” to leverage clinical trials for broader impact. Abbey Sawyer shared insights about how to measure the impact of BCI in clinical research. And yet: Despite the bonhomie, mutual respect, and promising rhetoric, the reality is that alignment will be challenging. In the BCI startup panel, after describing how nuances in product and procedures will drive differences in trial design and clinical outcomes, Tom Oxley summed it up: “Everyone wants to do something slightly different.” Persuading payers to cover BCI will undeniably become the field’s top goal. McMullen’s counterpart on the symposium’s closing panel was TJ Sutphin, Ombudsman for Pharma and Tech at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Sutphin also spoke at the aforementioned COA session for BCI last month. His primer covered coding and coverage channels, “innovator’s guide” resources, and touched on coverage decisions for speech generating devices, DBS, cochlear implants, and other topics. Despite the airtime, I felt that he offered little insight to CMS’s specific thinking about BCI. This is underscores the need to recruit health plan medical directors and commercial reimbursement leaders from Medtronic, Boston Scientific, or other neuromodulation companies to future discussions about BCI. The job of CMS, and to a lesser extent, FDA, is to be reactive to engagement from BCI companies, moreso than act as proactive partners. Mount Sinai has an opportunity - I would argue, an imperative - to leverage their market relationships as an experienced health system and invite their insurer counterparts into the room in future iterations of this event. This would amount to two-way opportunity for payers to educate attendees on their thought process and perspectives, and absorb key insights on the benefits and value of BCI from some of the world’s leading experts. Patient advocacy will bridge the divide between clinical research and commercial success. Across the two days, Pioneer voices and videos were elevated on the stage in a way that transcended marketing or storytelling; at this early stage, each and every BCI user represents a highly valuable and slightly different case study filled with technical, clinical, practical, and socioeconomic insights that remain largely underleveraged. Rather than asking Pioneers like Burkhart to repeat their stories, the field needs to lean on their detailed market research, numerous publications, federal advocacy efforts, strategic philanthropy, and other insights. Commercial success will require integrating BCI into smart homes, navigating limits of disability policy and routes to reimplantation, and improving ethics of clinical trials. An example of the latter came from Dan Rubin, Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School/Mass General, where BCI trial participants can “reconsent” twice, for up to an additional seven years of using their BCI following the end of their trial. Caregiver perspectives were infrequently mentioned in the sessions I attended. BCI cannot cure paralysis, so family members and caregivers have a critical role in expanding conversations on decentralizing clinical research, exploring economic evidence generation around time and costs, and configuring BCI for communication and in-home deployment. The latter was explored briefly by Mariska J. Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center in a case study about “nocturnal caregiver calling” that drew questions from BCI executives in the audience, suggesting that such key explorations of daily living should not be relegated to academic research. Like the titles of many presenters, this recap has become a bit long, so I’ll close with a powerful framing by Peter Yoo, Synchron’s Senior Director of Neuroscience and Algorithms. In designing functional systems in dynamic interplay between hardware, software, and the end user, Yoo spoke about balancing reliability off the shelf, and adaptability to account for individual customization and technical advances: “This isn’t just a simple engineering challenge. When the human is in the loop, it impacts the whole system.” BCI then, is more than a field of research, a technology product or a commercial market. It’s a platform for optimizing the common boundaries of computers and human beings. The next era will not spin out from technical revolutions in a laboratory, but by helping people in their homes. Like the word BCI itself, it’s easier said than done. For all the students, engineers, doctors, executives, and others working in this field, the future is not just undeniably bright - it’s here.

Title: Trump win sparks big rally in stocks

Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF trades over $1 billion in the first 20 minutes

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $1 billion in trading volume within the first 20 minutes of market opening on November 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

Title: Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.

Wall Street analysts believe that Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s growth prospects are expected to be aided by its asset-light model, which should enable the company to expand into lower-tier cities in China. The firm’s focus on affordable luxury and its strong network of licensed stores provide a healthy foundation for future growth. The analysts are optimistic about Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) as a result of its strong licensing model and healthy post-pandemic recovery. The company’s strategy revolves around the successful use of licensing, which led to the expansion of its brand reach across Mainland China and fortified Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s position in Hong Kong/Macau and several other international markets. The company continues to focus on cost efficiency and store optimization and remains well-placed to manage potential rental cost hikes. Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s successful reinvigoration of tourist sales and a lower gold hedging ratio should help it to capitalize on rising gold prices. The company highlighted that the decline in same-store sales in the Mainland market (which includes self-operated shops and licensed shops) and the Hong Kong market narrowed since September. From 1 October - 14 October 2024, its overall same-store sales performance demonstrated some improvements as compared to Q2. The mainland government continues to work on boosting domestic demand. In hopes of improved macroeconomic conditions and recovery of retail sentiment, its retailing business should regain its growth momentum. Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) is optimistic about its mid-to-long-term business prospects and it will continue to expand in the Mainland market. As per Wall Street analysts, the shares of the company have an average price target of $2.20. Overall LKFLF ranks 6th on our list of the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to invest in.
