From heavy hitters such as Electric Picnic and Dublin Theatre Festival to more esoteric gatherings, the Irish festival calendar has something for everyone. The list below offers just a taste of the cultural showcases coming up in 2025. Lots of festivals won’t announce their programmes until later in the year, so keep an eye on their websites and social media. The Chinese Year of the Snake symbolises wisdom, transformation and resilience. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, immortality and healing. The Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on Sunday, February 2nd, with the festival’s flagship event, a day of festivities in Meeting House Square.

Honouring the Celtic goddess Brigid, who embodies inspiration, healing, magic, smithcraft, wisdom, poetry, protection, fire and earth, it showcases women’s contributions, past and present, with a citywide programme spotlighting women’s stories, underscoring their impact on society and heralding the arrival of spring.

Title: Elegant Victorian with showstopper potential on Donnybrook’s Marlborough Road for €1.95m

In their lifetime, many of the large Victorian properties on Marlborough Road in Donnybrook have transitioned from family homes to flats and back again. Number 102, which was built in 1856, falls somewhere in between. It has been owned by the same family for several years, and has been adapted over time for different life stages. While it is not set out in self-contained units per se, separate living spaces have been created inside the two-storey over-basement redbrick. With a floor area of 285sq m (3,067sq ft) and a total of six bedrooms, the Dublin 4 property is in good condition, with many original features intact and well-maintained. It is on the market through Mullery O’Gara with an asking price of €1.95 million. Marlborough Road is a long, tree-lined street in Dublin 4 with Morehampton Road at one end and Sandford Road at the other, effectively connecting Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. Most homes along the road that were converted into flats in years gone by have now been returned to family homes. Taking number 102 back to a family home in its entirety would not require too much work. The house has not been carved out into individual flats, so new owners could move in following a little reconfiguring. The granite steps lead up to the main entrance, with the Victorian architecture evident from the minute you walk into the hallway. The ornate coving, detailed architraves and original stained-glass window have all been restored and showcased. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] To the left is the drawingroom, which has not lost any of its grandeur during the property’s many guises, with high ceilings, sash windows and the original granite fireplace remaining the standout features. Straight ahead is a study with a long sash window looking out over the rear garden. Beside this is a less formal reception room with a beautiful marble fireplace. The independent living spaces are downstairs at garden level. There is a separate entrance to this floor that has two bedrooms with their own bathrooms and living areas with kitchenette. If new owners wished to turn this house back to a cohesive home, this level would probably be where they would house the kitchen with access to the garden. With the 32m-long south-facing garden, extending further out would be an option, subject to planning permission. There are many homes on the road that have done exactly this, so a quick knock into the neighbours may provide some design inspiration. Out front, there is parking for several cars in the gravel driveway. Although the road can get busy, particularly with school runs in the morning, the house is set back enough for the passing cars to go more or less unnoticed. Upstairs on the first floor there are four bedrooms, each with a cast-iron fireplace. There is also a shower room and separate WC that would benefit from an upgrade. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] There is so much potential at number 102 to create a home that will grow with a family, from toddlers needing room to play to young adults looking for a bit of independence within the home. The property is Ber-exempt, but as it currently uses electric storage heaters, new owners will probably want to investigate retrofitting. Recent sales on the road include number 59, which sold last summer for more than €1.515 million, according to the Property Price Register. This was a midterrace two-storey-over-basement property that was set out in flats and in need of renovation. Number 75 sold for €1.925 million last September. It was also midterrace and smaller than number 102, but restored to a high level. Interest in Marlborough Road is not just for the fine houses. The location in Dublin 4 is a huge pull when it comes to potential buyers. The street may feel exclusive and private, yet it is only 3km from St Stephen’s Green. For families with children of school-going age, Muckross Park College is on the road, while Sandford Park and Gonzaga are just across the way. Herbert Park is a short walk away, as are Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. At weekends and on long summer evenings, the kids can turn left and be at Scoop in Ranelagh for a gelato in five minutes, while the adults can turn right and enjoy the short walk to Donnybrook Fair for a more sophisticated treat.

Title: Upgraded and extended home in Clonskeagh for €1.25m

Number 2 Beechmount Drive was a very different house in 2015. When the current owners bought the property 10 years ago, it had been lived in by two friends. The friends divided the house in two so they could both have their own living spaces, which resulted in a house that had two of everything, from doorbells to bathrooms. It has since undergone a complete renovation, with not much left of the original house, bar the door frame and the external walls at the front. The ground floor was extended, and the garage was converted, with extra accommodation added above it. With a floor area of 205sq m (2,207sq ft), the semidetached home is on the market through DNG, seeking €1.25m. The new layout downstairs caters for every situation. At the back is a large open-plan kitchen with units by Glenwise in Kimmage. There is enough room for a living area and dining area, which is ideal when entertaining. Through sliding pocket doors is a cosy TV room with bespoke storage units, also making it a good option for a playroom. At the front of the house is a livingroom with solid-fuel stove and an office on the other side of the hallway. There is also a guest loo and utility room on the ground floor. Upstairs there are three double bedrooms. The original box room was taken out and used as an en suite and dressingroom for the main bedroom, as well as to make room for a staircase up to the converted attic. The main bathroom has a separate bath and shower, and the attic has also been plumbed, so new owners could add another bathroom. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] The house was renovated with a view that the owners would stay forever, so they put the best of everything into it. There are small things in the house that will make a big difference to daily life such as the laundry chute in the hot press upstairs that goes down to the utility room, and the charging drawer in the kitchen where you can plug in your devices. The Ber rating was brought up to an impressive B2 following the renovations, which included high levels of insulation, the installation of underfloor heating on the ground floor as well as solar panels on the roof that heat the water. An electric car charging point has also been fitted in the front driveway. Double doors from the kitchen open out to a patio, which steps down to the lawn of the 40m garden. The mature trees in neighbouring gardens create a real sense of privacy when out in the east-facing garden. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] The area is very popular with families as it has schools, parks, playgrounds, UCD and cafes. Windy Arbour Luas stop is a five-minute walk away. The bus stop around the corner from the house on Bird Avenue is served by the new S4 bus route that runs from UCD to Liffey Valley, as well as the 142, which starts in Portmarnock and ends at UCD. When the owners completed the project on their home on Beechmount Drive, they thought they would never leave. Their heads have been turned by another house in need of renovation, however, so they feel the time is right to get their hands dirty once again.

Title: Chasing the Don: How EU politicians are jockeying for position with Trump

From Nigel Farage to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, here are the competitors for the position of Europe's Trump whisperer. By NICHOLAS VINOCUR and JACOPO BARIGAZZI AI generated Text-to-speech Europe has discovered a new competitive sport: jockeying to get close to United States President Donald Trump. The first high-stakes interaction seemed to go badly. The fiery phone call between Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was so alarming that she promptly set off on a European tour to shore up support in Berlin, Brussels and Paris against America seizing Greenland. For other leaders, the big fear is that the newly installed president could impose punishing tariffs. But will he actually listen? Is there anyone in Brussels or elsewhere in Europe who really has his ear? European politicians are lining up to explain why they should be the ones to “interpret” the bloc’s thorny politics to the U.S. president. The invitation list for his inauguration, however, suggested the Trump camp was closer to several far-right politicians than mainstream national leaders. In an attempt to shed light on who stands where in Trump’s international pecking order, POLITICO has put together a guide to the key aspiring “Trump whisperers” in Europe and ranked them on their “Trump-compatibility.” Here we go: When it comes to currying favor with Trump, Italy’s right-wing prime minister is at the front of the line. Before she became the only European Union leader to be invited to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni met with the Republican leader during a huddle facilitated by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the reopening of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in December. Then there was a private huddle earlier this month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, following which he called Meloni “a fantastic woman” and gave her a domestic win by helping her negotiate a hostage release in Iran. Trump’s willingness to meet Meloni face-to-face puts her in a league of her own in terms of access compared to other European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron or German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Significantly, Meloni’s foreign minister is one of only four EU ministers to have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio since Jan. 20. That said, it remains to be seen just how deep Meloni’s connection goes. She also maintained close ties with the administration of previous U.S. President Joe Biden before Trump’s election victory, a point that may be held against her by Trump’s MAGA entourage. Another black mark: Italy’s defense spending, which is below 2 percent of gross domestic product and will shrink in 2025, is far from Trump’s desired goal of 5 percent of GDP for European countries. Finally, Meloni’s coziness with Musk could become a disadvantage if the tech mogul suddenly loses sway with Trump. But what look like drawbacks may well help Meloni in the end, argues Beniamino Irdi, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. Low defense spending “puts her in the unique position of being perhaps the only one amongst the bad players [like Spain or Belgium] who speaks the same language as Trump. And she has a very big stake in trying to valorize this affinity,” he said. — By Hannah Roberts Trump compatibility score: Hungary’s strongman leader is another contender for the position of Trump’s “chief whisperer” in Europe. The illiberal ruler of Hungary bagged not one but two invitations to Mar-a-Lago in 2024, and has been effusive in his praise of the MAGA leader for years. Trump has returned the favor by repeatedly name-checking Orbán in his speeches, even calling him a “great man.” There are also extensive contacts between Trump allies in Washington and Orbán’s friends in Budapest, who contributed to the “Project 2025” plan for Trump’s second term prepared by the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank. However, Orbán’s pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies may put a serious damper on his popularity with Trump in office. While Trump threatens sanctions against Russia to force it to stop its war against Ukraine, Hungary has stood in the way, this week threatening to block the rollover of EU sanctions against Moscow. Orbán has also gone out of his way to court Chinese business interests, inviting Beijing-backed corporations to build railways and electric vehicle factories in his country. What’s more, the prime minister has publicly pushed back on Trump’s request that EU countries spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense. At this stage, even the Hungarians are hedging about their Trump-compatibility. “The question of becoming a bridge between the U.S. administration and the EU is relevant only if the U.S. administration is looking for such a bridge, which cannot be taken for granted,” said János Bóka, Hungary’s EU affairs minister. Hungary doesn’t “pretend to speak on behalf of the European Union, and we don’t pretend to have a mandate to negotiate or to facilitate any agreement between the European Union and the United States,” he told a small group of journalists last week. Move to the back of the line, Viktor. — By Jacopo Barigazzi Trump compatibility score: These Polish right-wingers are as MAGA-compatible as it gets. Speaking to POLITICO in December, Morawiecki said that together with Italian Prime Minister Meloni, he would be “an ideal intermediary between the United States and Europe.” That must have pleased some people close to Trump because Morawiecki, along with other hard-right EU politicians, scored an invitation to the inauguration. To prove his loyalty, Morawiecki posted a picture of himself in front of Trump and Vice President JD Vance, writing that a “wind of change” was blowing “faster and faster toward Poland.” Duda, for his part, is among the European leaders Trump knows best after meeting him several times during his first term. (That said, Duda is leaving office in May, and Trump didn’t have any time to spare for him in September when he abruptly canceled a planned meeting.) For now, Poland’s MAGA allies are playing second fiddle to Meloni, even though Warsaw is doing far better than Rome in terms of defense spending. The big question now is whether one of Duda and Morawiecki’s allies will win a presidential election in May. If Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by their Law and Justice party, becomes Polish president, the bridge to Trump may be preserved. If not, that privilege will likely be lost to Poland’s current prime minister, Donald Tusk. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: The Brexiteer-in-chief has long boasted of his friendship with Trump, celebrating the latter’s win on election night in Mar-a-Lago and joining the inauguration glitz as part of a cast of global right-wingers. He has even talked up the idea he would do a better job as U.S. ambassador than Britain’s actual pick — and Trump has returned the favor by praising him as a “handsome” man after his own image. The pair’s politics are firmly aligned, and Farage has long plied the same smash-the-establishment message as Trump as he tries to unsettle Britain’s Labour government. Yet it’s not all sweetness and light: The Reform UK leader has found himself decidedly out of favor of late with Trump’s right hand man, Musk, with the pair clashing over Musk’s backing of a jailed British far-right agitator deemed too extreme for Farage. Add to that the fact that Farage isn’t a head of state or government and comes from an island nation that has commanded steadily less of Trump’s attention. — By Matt Honeycombe-Foster Trump compatibility score: The French far-right flamethrower’s relationship with Trump dates back to at least 2022, when Éric Zemmour let it be known that he was getting political advice from the man who would become the 47th president of the United States. The revelation came as something of a surprise. Though Zemmour had modeled his presidential campaign on Trump’s, embracing the role of a culture warrior unafraid to create buzz by being controversial, the then-ex president’s reputation was at its lowest. At the time, a Trump return to the White House seemed a pipe dream after a second impeachment, making the idea of the French commentator-turned-presidential-candidate’s aligning himself with a disgraced leader seem foolish. Zemmour’s campaign eventually petered out, and so did his political relevance. So it came as a surprise when POLITICO discovered that Zemmour and his political and romantic partner, member of the European Parliament Sarah Knafo, had got their hands on tickets to the inauguration. In terms of politics, Trump and Zemmour aren’t a perfect fit, as Trump’s protectionist economic beliefs align better with Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement, the National Rally, than with those of Zemmour’s party, Reconquest. But Trump has made it clear he values loyalty and respect, and it was Zemmour who reached out during the president’s darkest days. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: A teacher by trade who embodies plucky bonhomie, Rutte isn’t the most obvious sparring partner for Trump. But thanks to his lengthy leadership experience in the Netherlands, where he was prime minister for 14 years, and his current big job at NATO, Mark Rutte may be at the front of the line when it comes to whispering in POTUS’s ear. Quite simply, Rutte is the man Trump is relying on to force Europeans to start spending more on defense. The Dutchman has taken to this role with relish, telling locals that Donald is “right” when it comes to Europeans taking more responsibility for their own defense, and warning them that Russia may be knocking on their doors next if they fail to step up. He’s also one of the few Europeans to have been invited to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. To be sure, Trump held back on praising Rutte after their meeting. The Dutchman is also a lifelong centrist and doesn’t share any obvious ideological similarities with Trump. But Rutte, like Trump, is a dealmaker who has something to offer. And that could prove more valuable in the long run than political alignment. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: This pairing isn’t a natural fit for Trump. As former head of the European Council (an institution Trump has taken to ignoring) and an opponent of the Law and Justice party, Donald Tusk is at odds with Trump’s natural hard-right allies in Poland (see above). Meanwhile, Radosław Sikorski is an Atlanticist whose wife, The Atlantic writer Anne Applebaum, is a prominent Trump critic. However, as with Rutte, Trump’s need to engage with key defensive players in Europe means the U.S. president may look beyond any ideological difference and end up having more to do with this pair than with other EU leaders. Indeed, Sikorski was one of the first European foreign ministers to speak to Marco Rubio following his confirmation as secretary of state. It helps that Poland is on course to meet Trump’s defense spending target of 5 percent of GDP before any other European country, making Warsaw “top of the class” in Washington’s eyes. Some commentators have latched on to this fact, dubbing Tusk the “most likely to become Trump’s whisperer” in Europe. What could spoil the party, however, is if Law and Justice candidate Nawrocki becomes Polish president in an upcoming election. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: Friedrich Merz’s connection with Trump is all about power and position. Put simply, Merz is on course to become leader of Europe’s top economy, which would make him a natural counterpart for the U.S. president. Merz himself has recognized this role, saying in an interview last week that “Germany must take on a leading role” in negotiations with Trump. This could happen, he has said, if Germany bought F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. but maintained them at home, building any necessary factories: “That would be a good deal for both sides,” he claimed. The conservative heavyweight’s confidence seems to flow mostly from his business background. Merz is a corporate lawyer by trade who has spent most of the past two decades quietly stewing while sitting on company boards — including at BlackRock — and making a small fortune. He’s also known for bashing the progressive left for its gender debates while talking up his anti-immigration credentials. Remarkably, he has been spared from the attacks of Musk, who has referred to the incumbent center-left chancellor, Scholz, as “a fool,” while endorsing far-right German politician Alice Weidel. Whether Merz will be capable of turning the page when it comes to dealing with Trump remains questionable. Trump notoriously detested former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and while Merz tried to approach Trump via a handwritten letter congratulating him on his inauguration, there has been no known contact between the two men. That said, Trump likes power. And as of Feb. 24, Merz may well be Europe’s most powerful politician. — By Nette Nöstlinger Trump compatibility score: The French president is giving Trump a dose of “je t’aime, moi non plus.” (“I love you, me neither,” the title of an old Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot song.) After rushing to congratulate Trump on his election victory in November, Emmanuel Macron also warned that Europe needs to start flexing its muscles if it wants to earn the respect of the new U.S. president. Macron was not present at Trump’s inauguration, nor did he receive an official invitation, according to French diplomats. But insiders point to Trump’s decision to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral as a sign of Macron’s influence with the new U.S. administration. It was on the sidelines of that visit that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Macron’s tough-love approach might work with the Donald, who clearly appeared to enjoy knuckle-crunching handshakes with the French president in his first mandate (these handshake battles have also resumed). Trump has called Macron a “very nice guy” but also a “wise guy,” and loves to boast that he got Macron to fold in an escalating trade war with France. But with Trump putting even more emphasis on allegiance in his second mandate, it’s unlikely Macron has the right recipe to get through to him. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: This trio is at the top of the food chain when it comes to power in the EU institutions. For Trump, however, they’re at the bottom of the pile of preferred foreign partners. Commenting on Trump’s preference for engaging with national leaders rather than with the EU, one EU diplomat said: “He’s clearly shown that he wants to do bilateral relations. This may be a negotiating tactic, as he knows he will have to deal with the EU on trade, but it’s potentially problematic.” Indeed, in the face of Trump’s cold shoulder, top EU representatives are trying out two — seemingly contradictory — strategies. The first is to signal openness to engage with Trump, and Kaja Kallas invited his top diplomat to attend a high-level European gathering. The second is to signal to Trump that Europe has relationships with other powerful countries around the world, as Ursula von der Leyen did in a recent speech in Davos, Switzerland, where she touted EU relations with India and Latin America over the United States. At the end of the day, Trump will have to speak to the EU. But the first days of his presidency have made it clear where he places the bloc on his list of priorities: Way down at the bottom. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score:

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. There are various reasons why this company makes an excellent investment. For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, increasing 28% from the previous quarter and 486% rise from the previous year. Moreover, the NVIDIA Cosmos platform plans to advance physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI. Lastly, the company aims to revolutionize graphics with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS). Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Robinhood CEO warns US risks losing financial edge without tokenization clarity

Tenev warned that without clear tokenization rules, the US risks losing its financial market dominance to more progressive economies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev warned that the US could lose its competitive edge in financial markets if regulators fail to provide clear rules for tokenized securities. In a Jan. 28 op-ed for The Washington Post, Tenev argued that blockchain-based financial assets could broaden investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to participate in the early growth of high-profile private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe. He highlighted that these firms have increasingly avoided public markets, limiting investment access to only the wealthiest individuals and widening the gap between institutional and retail investors. According to Tenev: “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind. It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” Tenev outlined a path for regulators to integrate tokenized securities into the financial system, proposing a security token registration framework as an alternative to traditional IPOs. He argued that companies should have a regulated option to issue tokenized equity, which would provide retail investors with early access to high-growth firms while maintaining proper disclosures and investor protections. Additionally, he called for clear guidelines that would allow exchanges and broker-dealers to facilitate the trading of tokenized assets, ensuring liquidity and market stability. Tenev also noted that the SEC’s accredited investor rule, which currently restricts private market investments to individuals meeting high-income or net-worth thresholds, is another critical issue for the industry. He suggested updating the rule to allow broader participation based on financial literacy rather than wealth alone, a move he believes would democratize investment opportunities and bring US markets in line with other jurisdictions that have adopted more inclusive policies. Tenev’s remarks reflect a growing push among financial leaders for regulatory clarity on tokenization. He recently urged the SEC to approve tokenization efforts to modernize traditional finance. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called tokenized securities the “next frontier” in financial markets, arguing that the tokenization of stocks and bonds could make capital markets more efficient. Industry analysts expect tokenization to become a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, with McKinsey, BCG, and Bernstein forecasting a rapid expansion of blockchain-based real-world assets. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization for bonds, funds, commodities, and real estate, seeking faster settlement times and broader investor participation. Despite mounting industry support, US regulators have yet to establish a clear framework, raising concerns that the country could fall behind financial hubs like the EU, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi. Tenev warned that unless the US acts swiftly, it risks losing its leadership in capital markets as other jurisdictions embrace the next phase of financial innovation.

EV maker Rivian (RIVN) is giving back 3% today after wealth manager Bernstein started coverage of the shares with an Underperform rating. Why Bernstein Is Bearish on RIVN Bernstein believes that the automaker can achieve its goal of handing over 500,000 EVs by 2030, but the wealth manager does not believe that RIVN's attainment of this milestone will provide its shareholders with "financial success." A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall. That's because, according to Bernstein, the company's gross margins will only be about 15% by the end of this decade. Additionally, Bernstein believes that Rivian will burn $14 billion of cash before it breaks even. Finally, RIVN will be hindered by the decelerating growth of its markets, stepped-up competition, and the relatively low ceiling of its addressable market, Bernstein warned. The wealth manager placed a $6.10 price target on the name. Rivian Not "Particularly Worried" by Trump's Policies On Jan. 23, RIVN CEO RJ Scaringe said that he was not "particularly worried" about the Trump administration's anti-EV stance. “I don’t think we’re particularly worried about any of it because whatever happens will be equally applied to all, I think in the end it’s sort of like there’s small speed bumps along the way and it’s on us to respond to whatever that environment is,” the CEO explained.

Ireland’s nemesis from last season come to Cork on Thursday night as Under-20 Six Nations and World Cup champions, and en route to those titles England twice found a way past Ireland. Mark Mapletoft’s squad prevented Ireland from winning a third successive Grand Slam, when the sides drew 32-32 in a lavishly entertaining encounter at The Rec in Bath. When the dust settled at tournament’s end, England had one more bonus point than their rivals to claim the title. Later in the summer they had a little more leeway on the scoreboard in beating Ireland in a World Cup semi-final before dethroning the reigning champions France in the final. Eight of England’s starting team on Thursday night shared in that world triumph while another two on the bench, Lucas Friday and Josh Bellamy, were part of that success. Northampton Saints scrumhalf Archie McParland played against Ireland in the game last season, while more recently he got a run against Munster in the Champions Cup. The majority of the England team have played for their clubs in the Premiership, while some have also togged out in Europe. Right wing Jack Bracken is a son of Skerries-born former England scrumhalf Kyran Bracken, Henry Pollock is one of the best young players in the world game and was seconded from the senior squad to play, while Junior Kpoku, younger brother of Joel and Jonathan, is a 6ft 8in flanker who has shifted from the second row and plays for Racing in Paris. Ireland’s injury profile has denied them some of last year’s side, Alan Spicer, Shannon duo Luke Murphy and Emmet Calvey, Niall Smyth, Todd Lawlor and hugely promising scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of former Connacht and Munster wing, Alex. There wasn’t any clarification on injuries but it’s a pity Tullamore’s Páidí Farrell, a rare sighting in Irish rugby – a player with top end pace – isn’t getting a run. The home side have a new head coach in Neil Doak, while Séamus Toomey and Andrew Browne have joined Ian Keatley as assistant coaches. Four of Ireland’s front five in the pack have played at this level, including prop Alex Usanov who went on to play for Emerging Ireland in South Africa. Henry Walker, Alex Mullan and Billy Corrigan understand what’s required at this level. Ciarán Mangan, younger brother of Diarmuid, fullback Charlie Molony, centre Connor Fahy, secondrows Corrigan and Mahon Ronan have all played for Leinster A, while centre Eoghan Smyth, the promising Michael Foy and Gene O’Leary Kareem on the bench did so for Munster. Cork-born, Connacht academy prospect Éanna McCarthy captains the team and is joined by flanker Bobby Power and prop Billy Bohan, who were part of the Connacht A scene, while Walker, Clarke Logan, Tom McAllister, Connor Magee and David Green enjoyed that status with Ulster. Doak acknowledged: “The first 20 minutes is key for us, that we get to the level of the game and then stay in there. Like most teams, you have a plan and sometimes you have to adapt to that. We try to make sure that the players are able to solve any problems on the night. “This process it’s part developmental and part performance. From my point of view, all I’m trying to do is get the players the best framework to work from and then they’ve got to problem solve on the pitch. “We can anticipate what England might throw at us, we can anticipate what defensive shapes they may look at, but ultimately on the night, it’s about the players making really clear decisions, going after that and being as positive as they can.” There were a couple of hundred tickets left in midweek, but the game is expected to sell-out, guaranteeing the wonderful atmosphere that’s been a hallmark of Ireland’s run of success at the Cork venue. The home side will have to absorb and channel all that positivity against an England team that are short odds favourites. IRELAND UNDER-20: C Molony (UCD); D Moloney (Blackrock College), C Fahy (Clontarf), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); A Usanov (Clontarf), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley); Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: C Magee (Banbridge), B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), D Walsh (Terenure College), O Minogue (Shannon), A Doyle (Old Wesley), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC), D Green (QUB).

Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.

However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.

There are many aspects that contribute to this company being an excellent investment opportunity. Among them is the company’s consistent efforts to drive positive financial growth across all its quarters for the fiscal year 2024. For instance, as per the report for the third quarter of 2024, the US revenue grew 44% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $499 million. This strong performance follows the second quarter of 2024, where US commercial revenue increased 55% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $159 million. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2024, US commercial revenue saw a 40% year-over-year growth and a 14% quarter-over-quarter increase, reaching $150 million. Moreover, the company’s extended long-term partnership with the US Army to deliver the Army Vantage capability in support of the Army Data Platform also positions the company as a strong investment choice.

Title: Celestica Inc. (CLS) Posts Strong Revenue Growth in 2024, Secures Major Hyperscale Win

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Celestica Inc. (NYSE:CLS) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims.

The second quarter also saw strong performance, with a 23% growth from $1.94 billion in Q2 2023, following the first quarter's revenue of $2.21 billion, a 20% increase from $1.84 billion in Q1 2023.

Title: Trumpcoins, Global Growth and Regulatory Battles Defined Crypto This Week
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/trumpcoins-global-growth-and-regulatory-battles-defined-crypto-this-week/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T19:10:45Z

Political favor, institutional acceptance and regulatory scrutiny are increasingly colliding to redefine the digital asset landscape. At the heart of this transformation is the ongoing embrace of digital assets by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved swiftly to position, or re-position, America as a global leader in the financial technology. As blockchain and cryptocurrency continue to work toward the heart of traditional finance, 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for investors, businesses and regulators alike — one that could either cement crypto’s place in the global financial system or expose the industry’s lingering vulnerabilities. Either way, the era of digital assets operating in a regulatory gray zone appears to be ending. What comes next will depend on how the industry, and the policymakers shaping its future, navigate this new reality. Beyond politics and regulation, 2025 is already proving to be a year of significant institutional and geographic expansion for the global crypto sector. In Latin America, cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating, with PYMNTS reporting that Bybit is making inroads into taking crypto payments mainstream in Brazil with its new payment solution. According to a Monday (Jan. 27) press release, the Bybit Pay solution is live in Brazil and integrates with the Brazilian Pix instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This move enables users to make payments in both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. The launch of Bybit Pay would also seem to align with Latin America’s growing adoption of digital finance technologies and, in particular, Brazil’s emergence as a digital banking and payments superpower. As PYMNTS Intelligence has found in “How The World Does Digital: A Global Benchmark Of Consumer Digital Transformation,” Brazil leads the world in its digital engagement metrics. Elsewhere in Latin America, it’s all systems go for Coinbase to launch in Argentina after regulators in that South American nation gave their approval for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange to begin operating there, the company said Tuesday (Jan 28). But perhaps the most striking development in institutional adoption comes from the Czech National Bank (CNB), which is reportedly planning a multi-billion-euro bitcoin purchase. If confirmed, the move, announced Wednesday (Jan. 29), would make the Czech Republic the first Western nation to hold bitcoin as part of its reserves — a landmark shift in how central banks view digital assets. At the same time, blockchain technology is gaining traction within traditional financial markets. Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. During the most recent Eurogroup meeting in January, the European Central Bank (ECB) provided an update on its exploratory work on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions, reporting to the ministers present that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk. At the same time, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Elon Musk is reportedly considering using blockchain technology at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), per a Saturday (Jan. 25) report. Musk, head of the newly created agency, has floated the idea of using a digital ledger to monitor federal spending, make payments, secure data and manage government buildings. Donald Trump’s return to the White House has given the crypto industry its most powerful political advocate yet. Just days into his second term, America’s first “crypto president” issued an executive order, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” touching on many of the sector’s wants, needs and concerns. Now, however, Trump is leaning into digital assets — not just as a policy matter, but as a business opportunity. His media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), on Wednesday (Jan. 29) announced plans to expand into financial services, including cryptocurrency-related offerings. News broke the same day that websites selling products with President Donald Trump’s brand are now accepting the controversial $TRUMP meme coin as payment. The newfound support has also prompted shifts in institutional investment strategies. Per a Sunday (Jan. 26) report, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is even shutting down its U.K. office amid a new focus on the U.S. crypto sector following Donald Trump’s election. The investor opened the U.K. branch in 2023, its first outside the U.S., amid regulatory pressure in the U.S. The move back could underscore a belief that the U.S. is once again a more favorable jurisdiction for blockchain innovation — at least under the current administration. Separately, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken now lets users make payments with their accounts. Kraken Pay allows users to choose the crypto or fiat currency in their accounts that they want to send and transmit that payment instantly, according to a Wednesday (Jan. 29) company blog post. While political support is boosting industry confidence, crypto firms are still facing regulatory headwinds. Governments across the globe are tightening compliance standards, cracking down on illicit activity, and enforcing penalties against firms accused of skirting financial regulations. French authorities recently launched a probe against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, over allegations of money laundering. The investigation adds to Binance’s growing list of legal troubles, which include lawsuits and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will exit the U.S. market for at least two years after its operator, Seychelles-based Peken Global Limited, pleaded guilty Monday (Jan. 27) to one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Peken will also pay monetary penalties totaling more than $297 million, while two of its founders, Chun (Michael) Gan and Ke (Eric) Tang, will step down from any role in KuCoin’s management or operations. U.S. Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said in the release that KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering (AML) policies for years. “As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware and fraud schemes,” Sassoon said. “Today’s guilty plea and penalties show the cost of refusing to follow these laws and allowing unlawful activity to continue.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Says President Trump’s Executive Order Could End Crypto’s Four-Year Cycle – Here’s Why

Crypto’s traditional four-year cycle could come to an end because of President Trump’s executive order, according to Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a new note to investors, Hougan says that the four-year cycle appeared to be intact – until Trump came out with the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order. The executive order directs the United States government to promote stablecoins, end regulatory persecution of digital assets, the evaluation of a national crypto reserve, and other initiatives. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that crypto follows Bitcoin’s halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. While the four-year cycle is widely accepted as the norm by many crypto investors, Hougan says that the pattern might now be broken due to the implications of Trump’s executive orders, the implications of which could take years to play out. “The thing I’m wrestling with is that the downstream positive effects of the EO, plus the other changes in Washington, will be felt over the course of years, not months. In the absolute best-case scenario, it will take a year to align on and implement a new regulatory framework for crypto. It will take longer than that for the behemoths on Wall Street to fully orient themselves to crypto’s possibilities. If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new “crypto winter” in 2026? Will investors go into hibernation even though they know we’ve entered a new crypto-enabled world? If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback? My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis. But my guess is that any pullback will be shorter and shallower than in years past. Why? The crypto space has matured; there’s a greater variety of buyers and more value-oriented investors than ever before. I expect volatility, but I’m not sure I’d bet against crypto in 2026. As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Time Published: 2025-01-29T18:33:15Z

Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. "The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind," Tenev wrote. "It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century." However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to "rapidly approve" tokenization of stocks and bonds.

William Dudley, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Chris LaCivita, a political consultant and co-manager of Trump’s 2024 campaign, are joining Coinbase’s global advisory council, the company said in a press release. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democratic Arizona senator—who once proposed eliminating taxes on crypto transactions under $50—will also be joining the council, Coinbase said. What’s more, Allen & Co. Managing Director Luis Alberto Moreno, who serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum (WEF), will round out the group, Coinbase added. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad told Decrypt in a statement that the four new members represent “some of the brightest minds across finance, tech, and politics,” who will help guide Coinbase’s direction as “the world enters a new era for crypto.” Under the Biden administration, Coinbase faced heavy scrutiny from the SEC, which alleged that America’s leading crypto exchange violated agency rules in a now-frozen lawsuit. With Trump’s SEC apparently taking a crypto-friendlier bent with plans to bring about a sense of regulatory clarity, it appears Coinbase is taking on power players to advance its vision. “I believe we’ve reached a pivotal moment in crypto’s evolution,” Dudley, the former Fed policymaker, said in a statement. “Coinbase can ensure it is integrated into our financial system in a safe and beneficial way for Americans.” In 2018, as president of the New York Fed, Dudley warned that the “speculative mania around cryptocurrencies” was dangerous because of his perceived lack of underlying value, per the Wall Street Journal. While Bitcoin’s beginnings are rooted in a skepticism of the existing financial system—Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, embedded a message referencing bank bailouts in Bitcoin’s first block—Coinbase has embraced the industry’s ascent into the mainstream, working with companies who view blockchain as a natural evolution of financial markets. Coinbase first inked a partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2022. While BlackRock CEO Larry Fink continues to promote Bitcoin, he’s also talked extensively about the benefits associated with the tokenization of securities. Following a recent trip to Davos, where the WEF holds its annual meeting, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on X that the exchange will work with corporate leaders, from banks to asset managers, as investments accelerate into crypto. “We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone,” he wrote. "They need an institutional-grade partner like Coinbase, who can build relentlessly through the winters, to feel confident getting into crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Czech Central Bank To Vote On €7 Billion Bitcoin Investment On Thursday
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/czech-central-bank-vote-7-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T16:30:13Z
Full Content:
The Czech National Bank (CNB) is poised to decide on Thursday whether to allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion in foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin, an amount totaling roughly €7 billion (roughly $7.31 billion). Governor Aleš Michl revealed the plan in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, underlining a bold departure from the traditional asset strategies usually favored by major central banks. Michl, who previously worked as an investment fund manager, expressed his conviction that introducing BTC into the CNB’s portfolio could serve as a viable way to diversify holdings. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” he told the FT. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s “extreme volatility” and limited track record but pointed to rising institutional interest since global asset managers like BlackRock launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last year. Should the board approve the plan, the CNB could direct as much as 5% of its reserves—equivalent to approximately €7 billion—into Bitcoin. “Five percent [of our assets] is a lot of money, even for the Bitcoin market,” Michl noted, underscoring the potential impact of a sizable BTC purchase by a sovereign authority. Most central banks around the world have steered clear of BTC, preferring “safer” instruments such as highly rated government bonds. A few have ventured into equities, but public disclosures of Bitcoin holdings by these institutions (except for El Salvador) remain virtually nonexistent. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell confirmed in December that the US central bank does not hold Bitcoin, while comparing it to gold, describing it as a virtual and digital speculative asset. Other top monetary officials in Europe have been notoriously critical. The governor of the Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, likened Bitcoin to “digital tulips,” referencing the 17th-century speculative bubble. European Central Bank (ECB) officials have similarly argued that the “fair value of Bitcoin is still zero.” However, Michl struck a distinctly different tone. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker, I would say, I like profitability,” he told the FT. He also suggested more central banks might follow suit within the next five years, citing how some pension funds and commercial banks have begun holding BTC in their portfolios. Michl acknowledges the gamble: “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” Yet he also drew attention to the historical examples of failed corporate investments, such as Enron and Wirecard, arguing that underperformance is an inherent risk of portfolio management. Internal CNB calculations suggest that if the central bank had held 5% of its foreign reserves in BTC over the past decade, its annual returns would have increased by 3.5%—albeit with double the volatility. “But I’m saying that my goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good [for that], then let’s have it,” Michl remarked. In the interview, Michl referenced US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused executives in Washington. Last week, Trump issued an executive order to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling further discussions about crypto at the highest levels of government. While the Bitcoin proposal has captured headlines, the CNB already stands out for its relatively adventurous investment policy; 22% of its foreign exchange reserves are in equities—well above the norm for a central bank. Michl intends to increase US stock holdings to 50% of that equity portfolio within three years, up from the current 30%. “We are buying gradually and in very small steps because the [US stock] prices are the highest in history,” he explained. Whether the CNB board ultimately endorses Michl’s proposal to venture into BTC remains to be seen. If approved, the Czech National Bank could become the first major Western central bank to publicly hold crypto, setting a precedent that might inspire others—or serve as a cautionary tale. The CNB’s board meeting is scheduled for Thursday, with a final vote on the governor’s Bitcoin proposal expected shortly thereafter. At press time, BTC traded at $102,817.

Title: Institutions Are Primed for MicroStrategy's Preferred Stock Sale, Say Analysts

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). To say that MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been at the lead of creatively raising capital with which to buy massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) would be an understatement. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company this week opened a new front along those lines with its perpetual preferred stock offering (STRK). Preferred stock sits between equity and debt on the corporate balance sheet, offering investors the regular return of bonds while giving them an ownership stake in a company. Well-followed MicroStrategy analyst Ben Werkman, posted on X about the attraction preferred stock can offer institutional investors due to its lack of maturity risk, stable yield and optional equity upside. "I could see a scenario where [the preferred stock] starts taking some of the convertible bond space for fixed income accumulation due to the lack of any point in time maturity risk," said Werkman. "Preferred stock has the potential to be massively more accretive than any convertible offering has been and definitely more accretive than [share sales]." Similar sentiments came via Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, who called MSTR's preferred stock offering one of the most compelling securities in the market and a next-generation investment vehicle. "STRK is a near-perfect instrument," wrote Park. "It gives you two chances to win: First, when rates go down, it's a huge boon to the principal, and two, if MicroStrategy goes up first, then you have a deep in-the-money (ITM) option to convert and own the higher volatility asset or just directly sell." The largest of the U.S. preferred stock ETFs is the BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which has roughly $15 billion in assets under management. The largest holders of PFF ETF are major corporations such as Boeing (BA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi Group (C). The final pricing terms of the new security are to be completed and announced after the market closes on Thursday.

Title: Saga sets sail with £450m HPS refinancing boost

Saga, the financial services and travel provider to the over-50s, is tapping one of the world's biggest investment firms as part of a refinancing aimed at relieving pressure on its balance sheet. Sky News has learnt that London-listed Saga is lining up HPS - which is in the process of being taken over by the asset management behemoth BlackRock - to help refinance more than £450m of its existing debt. Financiers said an agreement was likely to be announced alongside a scheduled trading update from the company on Thursday morning. Money latest: People who only watch Netflix or Disney 'may have to pay BBC licence fee' The debt involved in the deal comprises a bond, a loan from chairman Sir Roger De Haan and Saga's revolving credit facility. A refinancing will be a boost to Saga, which has been weighed down by a debt pile which is huge relative to the value of its equity. It will come months after the company struck a partnership deal with the Belgian insurer Ageas, which involves a series of cash payments to the British business. In February last year, it also held talks with Open, an Australian company, about a sale of the division but the discussions fell apart. Saga has previously signalled that it would explore a similar partnership model for its cruises division, although a transaction is not thought to be imminent. Shares in Saga have fallen by just over 20% during the last 12 months, leaving it with a market capitalisation of about £165m.

Title: Czech National Bank Plans Multi-Billion Euro Bitcoin Purchase
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/czech-national-bank-plans-multi-billion-euro-bitcoin-purchase/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T15:06:48Z

The governor of the Czech National Bank reportedly wants to invest in bitcoin. The move — involving billions of euros worth of the country’s reserves — could make this the first central bank in a Western nation to hold cryptocurrency assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). Governor Aleš Michl said in an interview with the FT that he would present the bank’s board with the idea of investing in bitcoin as a way of diversifying the CNB’s reserves at a Thursday (Jan. 30) meeting. If the board agrees, the bank could someday hold up to 5% of its 140 billion euros of reserves in bitcoin, said Michl. Although he acknowledged bitcoin’s “extreme volatility” and limited record, Michl stressed growing investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other companies launched bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. He also noted President Donald Trump’s push to deregulate the crypto sector and the administration’s embrace of the industry. Trump last week issued an executive order that established a working group to study the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the FT. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The report points out that central banks have typically placed reserves in more conservative assets — U.S. Treasuries, bonds, equities — though none have publicly adopted crypto. Michl said he had “a totally different philosophy” about bitcoin compared to other central bank heads. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” Michl said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” While other central banks may be more reluctant to keep their reserves in bitcoin, they are — as covered here earlier this week — experimenting more frequently with blockchain and tokenization. At the most recent Eurogroup meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) offered an update on its exploration on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions. The bank reported that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. “This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk,” PYMNTS wrote. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will present a proposal this Thursday that could see up to $7 billion of the country's wealth flow into crypto, potentially making it the first Western central bank to hold digital assets. "For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good," Michl said in an interview with the Financial Times, acknowledging his stance differs from other central bankers when it comes to crypto matters. The proposal follows increased institutional interest in Bitcoin after BlackRock and other firms launched spot ETFs. Michl also cited U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and the growing influence of digital asset executives in his administration. This is not the first time that the country has made crypto headlines. In December, its parliament unanimously passed legislation exempting Bitcoin held over three years from capital gains tax. Earlier this month, Michl was quoted as saying that he had "considered" adopting Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve. Broader policy moves in the Eurozone are also shaping up in the background. No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it 🇨🇿🔥 pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W — Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024 Last week, the European Central Bank signaled its readiness for multiple rate cuts in 2025, with ECB President Christine Lagarde indicating a "gradual" approach toward monetary easing, according to reports from Reuters and CNBC out of Davos. Policymakers across Europe are slated to approve the cuts on January 30. The CNB has indeed carved out a niche in central banking with its investment strategies. Explaining its unique approach, Michl explained how the CNB's allocations are different from other central banks. Currently, the CNB allocates 22% of its portfolio to equities—primarily set on U.S. tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft. This is more than what most other central banks allocate, as they typically play it safe with government bonds. They're planning to ramp this up to 30% by 2029, betting on stocks to boost returns, Michl shared in the interview. Meanwhile, most central banks remain skeptical of crypto investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed in December it holds no Bitcoin, while European Central Bank officials maintained in February last year that the "fair value" of Bitcoin is "still zero," reacting to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs a month prior. Given these, Michl acknowledged potential risks, noting Bitcoin could end up worthless or achieve "absolutely fantastic value." Michl said the move is aimed at diversifying reserves rather than just speculating. “My goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good, then let’s have it,” he said. The bank did not immediately return Decrypt's request for comment. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Czech central bank chief proposes huge Bitcoin investment – FT
URL: https://www.rt.com/business/611846-czech-central-bank-bitcoin-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T14:55:43Z
Full Content:
The governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Ales Michl, wants to invest a substantial amount of the country’s reserves in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The value of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency hit a new record earlier this month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly US President Donald Trump. Michl told the FT that he will present a proposal to the CNB’s board on Thursday, to invest up to 5% of the central bank’s €140 billion ($145 billion) reserves in crypto. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the publication. The FT has described the potential move as “groundbreaking” and noted that the CNB could become the first Western central bank to hold crypto assets. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people,” Michl added. The banker also acknowledged the asset’s volatility, saying he was “ready” for a possible Bitcoin collapse. Central banks traditionally hold their reserves in conservative assets such as US Treasuries and other forms of high-yield debt. Some have holdings in stocks, but almost none have publicly ventured into cryptocurrencies, the FT noted. Bitcoin hit a new record high this month after Trump was sworn in, surpassing $109,000. Days into his term, the new US president signed an executive order establishing a working group to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Last year, the value of Bitcoin more than doubled, thanks partially to the approval of trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) shares by a US regulator. According to Michl, more central banks could follow his lead within the next five years, as several funds and commercial banks have started investing in crypto. Larry Fink, CEO of investment company BlackRock suggested recently that if institutions allocate between 2% and 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could reach $700,000. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for traditional banking systems. Its decentralized nature appeals to those seeking alternatives to government-backed currencies. However, this same feature has allegedly made it attractive for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Bitcoin’s value is influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, market availability, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment. Despite its growing use in commerce, Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area, with no uniform international laws governing its use. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency in 2021, although many governments remain cautious, warning about the risks associated with investing in such a volatile asset.

01/30 update below. This post was originally published on January 29 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stabilized after teetering on the edge of another tumble yesterday, with traders still reeling from a sudden sell-off that sparked fears of a "financial crisis." Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Thank you everyone. It’s fantastic to be here at Siemens at this amazing facility. Today, I want to talk about economic growth. Why it matters. How we achieve it. And what we are going to do further and faster to deliver it. Before we came into office… … the Prime Minister and I have said loud and clear: Economic growth is the number one mission of this government. Without growth, we cannot cut hospital waiting lists or put more police on the streets. Without growth, we cannot meet our climate goals… … or give the next generation the opportunities that they need to thrive. But most of all… … without economic growth… … we cannot improve the lives of ordinary working people. Because growth isn’t simply about lines on a graph. It’s about the pounds in people’s pockets. The vibrancy of our high streets. And the thriving businesses that create wealth, jobs and new opportunities for us, for our children, and grandchildren. We will have succeeded in our mission when working people are better off. I know that the cost of living crisis is still very real for many families across Britain. The sky high inflation and interest rates of the past few years have left a deep mark… … with too many people still making sacrifices to pay the bills and to pay their mortgages. But we have begun to turn this around. Everything I see as I travel around the country gives me more belief in Britain. And more optimism about our future. Because we as a country have huge potential. A country of strong communities, with small and local businesses at their heart. We are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in the world… … like artificial intelligence and life sciences… … with great companies like DeepMind, AstraZeneca, Rolls Royce… and of course Siemens… … delivering jobs and investment across Britain. We have fundamental strengths – in our history, in our language, and in our legal system – to compete in a global economy. But for too long, that potential has been held back. For too long, we have accepted low expectations and accepted decline. We no longer have to do that. We can do so much better. Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight. Without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country’s future for the better. That’s what our Plan for Change is all about. That is what drives me as Chancellor. In my Mais lecture in March last year, I set out my approach to achieving economic growth… … and identified the fundamental barriers to realising our full potential. The productive capacity of the UK economy has become far too weak. Productivity, the driver of living standards… …has grown more slowly here than in countries like Germany and the US. The supply side of our economy has suffered due to chronic underinvestment… … and stifling and unpredictable regulation… … not helped by the shocks we have faced in recent years. [redacted political content] The strategy that I have consistently set out… … is to grow the supply-side of our economy… … recognising that first and foremost… … it is businesses, investors and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth… … a government that systematically removes the barriers that they face – one by one and has their back This strategy has three essential elements: First, stability in our politics, our public finances and our economy - the basic condition for secure economic growth. Second, reform - reform which makes it easier for businesses to trade, to raise finance and to build. And third, investment, the lifeblood of economic growth. Let me explain each of those in turn. Stability – the first line of our manifesto was a promise to bring stability to the public finances. It is the rock upon which everything else is built. And it is the essential foundation of our Plan for Change. Because economic stability is the precondition for economic growth. That’s why the first piece of legislation that we passed as a government was the Budget Responsibility Act… … so never again will we see our independent forecaster sidelined. [redacted political content] At my first Budget in October… … it was my duty as Chancellor… … to fix the foundations of our economy, and repair the public finances that we inherited. To restore stability and create the conditions for growth and investment. I set out new fiscal rules which are non-negotiable, and will always be met. We began to rebuild our NHS and our schools – the start of a programme of public service reform. I capped the rate of corporation tax - and I extended our generous capital allowances for the duration of this parliament - as the CBI and the BCC have long called for. And I protected working people after a cost of living crisis… … by freezing fuel duty… … and with no increases in their National Insurance, Income Tax or VAT. But taking the right decisions and the responsible decisions does not always mean taking the easy decisions. The increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions has consequences on business and beyond. I said that up front in my Budget speech. I accept that there are costs to responsibility. But the costs of irresponsibility would have been far higher. Those who oppose my Budget know that too. That is why, since October, I have seen no alternative put forward [redacted political content]. No alternatives to deal with the challenges we face. No alternatives to restoring economic stability… … and therefore no plan for driving economic growth. Alongside stability, we need to drive forward the reform which makes investment more likely… … by removing the constraints on the supply side of our economy… … making it easier for businesses to trade… … to raise finance… … and to build. Let me first address our approach to trade. We stand at a moment of global change. In that context, we should be guided by one clear principle above all. To act in the national interest… … for our economy… … for our businesses… … and for the British people. That means building on our special relationship with the United States under President Trump. The Prime Minister discussed the vital importance of growth with the President last weekend… … and I look forward to working with the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent… … to deepen our economic relationship in the months and the years ahead. Acting in our national interest also means resetting our relationship with the EU – our nearest and our largest trading partner – to drive growth and support business. We are pragmatic about the challenges that we have inherited from the last government’s failed Brexit deal. But we are also ambitious in our goals. [redacted political content] … we will prioritise proposals that are consistent with our manifesto commitments… … and which contribute to British growth and British prosperity… … because that is what the national interest demands. Our approach to trade also means building stronger relationships with fast-growing economies all around the world. That is why I led a delegation to China for the first Economic and Financial Dialogue since 2019… … alongside world-leading financial service businesses, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Schroders… … unlocking £600 million of tangible benefits for the UK economy. And I am pleased to confirm that the Business and Trade Secretary will shortly visit India … … to restart talks on the free trade agreement and bilateral investment treaty [redacted political content]. Our businesses can only realise these opportunities if they can recruit the skilled staff that they need. So we are reforming our employment system to create a national jobs and careers service. We have created Skills England to meet the skills of the next decade in sectors like construction and engineering. And we will deliver fundamental reform of our welfare system. That includes looking at areas that have been ducked for too long… … like the rising cost of health and disability benefits… … and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will set out our plans to address this ahead of the Spring Statement. Next, the Immigration White Paper, that will bring forward concrete proposals to bring the overall levels of net migration down. But we know that the UK is in an international competition for talent in vital growth sectors. That is why last week, I set out plans for attracting global talent. We will look at the visa routes for very highly skilled people… … so the best people in the world choose the UK to live, work and create wealth… … bringing jobs and investment to Britain. To help businesses access the finance and support they need to grow… … we have delivered significant reforms to provide greater flexibility for firms and founders to raise finance on UK capital markets, by rewriting the UK’s listing rules. In my Mansion House speech, I announced a series of reforms to our pensions system… … including the creation of larger, consolidated funds… … which have much greater capacity to invest in high growth British companies at the scale that we need them to. The consultation on these reforms is already complete and the final report will be published in the Spring. Yesterday we confirmed that we have plans to go further, whilst always protecting the important role that pension funds play in the gilt market. We will introduce new flexibilities for well-funded Defined Benefit schemes… … to release surplus funds where it is safe to do so… … generating even more investment into some of our fastest growing industries. I know too that businesses are held back by a complex and unpredictable regulatory system… … and that is a drag on investment and innovation. We have already provided new growth-focused remits to our financial services regulators… … we have announced a new interim Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority… … and we have established the Regulatory Innovation Office, with an initial focus on synthetic biology, space, AI, and connected and autonomous vehicles. But we need to go further and we need to go faster. So earlier this month, I met the Heads of some of our largest regulators. They have already provided a range of options to drive growth in their sectors… … and proposals for how they can be more agile and responsive to businesses… … and we will publish that final action plan in March to make regulation work much better for our economy. To get Britain building again… … we have delivered the most significant reforms to our planning system in a generation. I have been genuinely shocked about how slow our planning system is. By how long it takes to get things done. Take the decision to build a solar farm in Cambridgeshire – a decision the Energy Secretary took only a few weeks into the job in July… [redacted political content] The Deputy Prime Minister has already driven significant progress across government in addressing these issues. My colleagues have determined 13 major planning decisions in just six months… … including for airports, data centres and major housing developments. We have significantly raised housing targets across our country and made them mandatory, so that we can build one-and-a-half million homes in this parliament. We have reformed decades-old “green belt” policies, making it easier to build on the “grey belt” land around our major cities. And we have opened up our planning system to build new infrastructure – like onshore wind farms or data centres driving the AI revolution. Having listened closely to calls from business groups like the Institute of Directors… … and businesses across our economy about the need to speed up infrastructure delivery… … including Mace, Skanska and Arup who are here today… … and members of our British Infrastructure Taskforce like Lloyds, Blackrock and Phoenix… … we have now set out plans to go even further. Last week we confirmed our priorities for the Planning and Infrastructure Bill … … to rapidly streamline the process for determining applications… … to make the consultation process far less burdensome… … and to fundamentally reform our approach to environmental regulation. The problems in our economy… … the lack of bold reform that we have seen over decades… … can be summed up by a £100 million bat tunnel built for HS2… … the type of decision that has made delivering major infrastructure in our country far too expensive and far too slow. So we are reducing the environmental requirements placed on developers when they pay into the nature restoration fund that we have created… …so they can focus on getting things built, and stop worrying about bats and newts. And to build our new infrastructure like nuclear power plants, trainlines and windfarms more quickly… … we are changing the rules to stop blockers getting in the way of development… … through excessive use of Judicial Review. This Bill, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, is a priority for this government. It will be introduced in the Spring… … and we will work tirelessly in parliament to ensure its smooth, and speedy and rapid delivery. By providing a foundation of economic stability… … and by delivering the reforms needed to make it easier for businesses to succeed and grow… … we will create the right conditions to increase investment in our economy – the final key element of our strategy. Investment and innovation go hand in hand. I want to see the sounds and the sights of the future arriving. Delivered by amazing businesses like Wayve and Oxford Nanopore. They are the future. And Britain should be the best place in the world to be an entrepreneur. That is why we protected funding for research and development… … and it is why one of the first decisions I made as Chancellor… … was to extend the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Venture Capital Trust schemes for a further 10 years… … to get more investment into new companies, driving their innovation and growth. I am determined to make Britain the best place in the world to invest. That was my message in Davos last week. That ambition demands action. The International Investment Summit that we hosted in October delivered £63 billion of investment right across our country… … from Iberdrola doubling its investment in clean energy in places like Suffolk… … Blackstone investing £10 billion in a data centre in Northumberland… … and Eren Holdings investing £1 billion in advanced manufacturing in North Wales. While the lifeblood of growth is business investment, a strategic state has a crucial role to play. That is why we established the National Wealth Fund… … to create that partnership between business, private investors and government to invest in the industries of the future… … like clean energy. Today I can announce two further investments by the National Wealth Fund. First, a £65 million investment for Connected Kerb, to expand their electric vehicle charging network across the UK. And second, a £28 million equity investment in Cornish Metals… … providing the raw materials to be used in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles… … supporting growth and jobs in the South-West of England. There is no trade-off between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century, and Britain must lead the way. That is why we will publish a refreshed Carbon Budget Delivery Plan later this year, which alongside the Spending Review, will set out our plans to deliver Carbon Budget 6. Today, I can also announce that we are removing barriers to deliver 16 gigawatts of offshore wind… … by designating new Marine Protected Areas to enable the development of this technology in areas like East Anglia and Yorkshire… … crowding in up to £30 billion of investment in homegrown clean power. And there’s more. Our industrial and manufacturing base, brilliantly represented by Make UK, have been banging their heads against the wall for years at the lack of a proper industrial strategy from government. That is why we have launched our modern industrial strategy… … to drive investment into the industries that will define our success in the years ahead. We have already provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences… … and we have set out reforms to boost financial services, the AI sector and creative industries. We are not wasting any time, and we will move forward with the next stages of the Industrial Strategy ahead of its publication in the Spring. We will work with the private sector to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs. This includes the Lower Thames Crossing, which will improve connectivity at Port of Tilbury and Dover, London Gateway and Medway… … alleviating severe congestion… … as goods destined for export come from the North, and the Midlands and across the country to markets overseas. To drive growth and deliver value for money for taxpayers, we are exploring options to privately finance this important project. And we have changed course on public investment, too… … with a new Investment Rule to ensure that we don’t just count the costs of investment – we count the benefits too. We are now investing 2.6% of GDP on average over the next five years, compared to 1.9% planned by the previous government.. … delivering an additional £100 billion of growth-enhancing capital spending… … which catalyses private sector investment… … in more housing… … better transport links… … and clean energy. These are significant steps in just six months… … and we are seeing some encouraging signs in the British economy. The IMF have upgraded our growth prospects for 2025… … the only G7 country outside the US to see this happen. This gives us the fastest growth of any major European economy this year. And a global survey of CEOs by PWC, has shown Britain is now the second most attractive country in the world for businesses looking to invest. The first time the UK has been in that position for 28 years. This is all welcome news. But there is still more that we can and will do. I am not satisfied with the position we are in. While we have huge amounts of potential, the structural problems in our economy run deep. And the low growth of the last 14 years cannot just be turned around overnight. This has to be our focus for the duration of the parliament. Because the situation demands us to do more. And today I will go further and faster in kickstarting economic growth. Our mission to grow our economy is about raising living standards in every single part of the United Kingdom. Manchester is home to the UK’s fastest growing tech sector. Leeds is one of the largest financial services centres outside of London. These great northern cities have so much potential and promise… …which our brilliant metro mayors, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin, are working hard to realise… … just like our other metro mayors are doing to deliver new opportunities in their areas. And there is so much more that government can do to support our city regions. To achieve this requires greater focus on two key areas: infrastructure and investment. If we can improve connectivity between towns and cities across the North of England, we can unlock their true growth potential… … by making it easier for people to live, travel and work across the area. At the Budget, I set out funding for the Transpennine Route Upgrade… … a multi-billion-pound programme of improvements that will connect towns and cities from Manchester to York via Stalybridge, Leeds and Huddersfield. We are delivering railway schemes to improve journeys for people across the North… … including upgrades at Bradford Forster Square and by electrifying the Wigan-Bolton line. We have committed to supporting the delivery of a new mass transit system in West Yorkshire. And in Spring, we will publish the Spending Review and a 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy… … which will set out further detail of our plans for infrastructure right across the UK. New transport infrastructure can also act as a catalyst for new housing. We have already seen the benefits that unlocking untapped land around stations can deliver in places like Stockport… … where joint work spearheaded by Andy Burnham and council leaders has delivered new housing and wider commercial opportunities. We will introduce a new approach to planning decisions on land around stations, changing the default answer to yes. We are working with the devolved governments to ensure the benefits of growth can be felt across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… … including by partnering with them on the Industrial Strategy to support their considerable sectoral strengths. And in December, I met with Metro Mayors from across England. They told me that more opportunities for investment are vital if their local economies are to grow in the years ahead. We are listening closely to them. As the Metro Mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, has called for… … we will review the Green Book and how it is being used to provide objective, transparent advice on public investment across the country, including outside London and the Southeast. This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead. The Office for Investment is going to be working hand in hand with local areas… … to develop a commercially attractive pipeline of investment opportunities for a global audience… … starting with the Liverpool City Region and the North East Combined Authority, led by Kim McGuinness. The National Wealth Fund is establishing strategic partnerships to provide deeper, more focused support for city regions, starting in Glasgow, West Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and Greater Manchester. We are supporting key investment opportunities across the UK. The government is backing Andy Burnham’s plans for the redevelopment of Old Trafford, which promises to create new housing and commercial development around a new stadium… … to drive regeneration and growth in the area. We are moving forward with the Wrexham and Flintshire Investment Zone… … focusing on the area’s strengths in advanced manufacturing… … backed by major businesses like Airbus and JCB… … to leverage £1 billion of private investment in the next ten years… … creating up to 6,000 jobs. [redacted political content] So I can announce today that we will work with Doncaster Council and the Mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard… … to support their efforts to recreate South Yorkshire Airport City as a thriving regional airport. And finally, I am pleased to announce a partnership between Prologis and Manchester Airport Group in the East Midlands, where the Metro Mayor Claire Ward is doing an excellent job growing the local economy there. Prologis and MAG will work together to build a new advanced manufacturing and logistics park at East Midlands Airport … … unlocking up to £1 billion of investment and 2,000 jobs at the site… … a major investment from a global business into our country… … representing a huge vote of confidence in the East Midlands and in the UK. This is just the start of our work to get more investment into every nation and region of Britain. Next, I want to set out further detail for plans for the area we are in today. Oxford and Cambridge offer huge potential for our nation’s growth prospects. Only 66 miles apart… … these cities are home to two of the best universities in the world… … and the area is a hub for globally renowned science and technology firms. This area has the potential to be Europe’s Silicon Valley. To make that a reality, we need a systematic approach to attract businesses to come here and to grow here. At the moment, it takes over two and a half hours to travel between Oxford and Cambridge by train. There is no way to commute directly by rail from places like Bedford and Milton Keynes to Cambridge. And there is a lack of affordable housing right across the region. In other words, the demand is there… … but there are far too many supply side constraints on economic growth here. We are going to fix that. The Ox Cam arc was initially launched in 2003 – over 20 years ago. [redacted political content] We are not prepared to miss out on the opportunities here any longer. So working with the Deputy Prime Minister… … who is already driving forward vital work in the region… … we are going further and faster to unlock the potential of the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor. First, we are funding the transport links needed to make the Oxford Cambridge growth corridor a success… … including East-West Rail, with new services between Oxford and Milton Keynes starting this year… … and road upgrades to reduce journey times between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. East West Rail will also support vibrant new and expanded communities along the route. We have already received proposals for New Towns along the new railway… … with 18 submissions for sizeable new developments. At Tempsford – the nexus of the East Coast Mainline, the A1 and East West Rail… …we will move quicker to deliver a mainline station, meaning journey times to London of under an hour… … and to Cambridge in under 30 minutes when East West Rail is operational. Second, we are ensuring that the area has the right infrastructure and public services in place to support the growth corridor as it expands. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital is being prioritised for investment as part of wave 1 of the New Hospital Programme. Water infrastructure has also been a major hindrance to development. So we have now agreed water resources management plans, unlocking £7.9 billion of investment in the next 5 years… …including plans for the new Fens Reservoir serving Cambridge and the South East Strategic Reservoir near Oxford. And I can confirm today that the Environment Agency have now lifted their objections to new development in Cambridge, following this government’s intervention to address water scarcity… … which means 4,500 additional homes, new schools, and new office, retail and laboratory space can be built. Third, I am delighted that Cambridge University have come forward with plans for a new flagship innovation hub at the centre of Cambridge… … to attract global investment and foster a community that catalyses innovation, as other cities around the world like Boston and Paris have done. Just yesterday, Moderna completed the build for their new vaccine production and R&D site in Harwell, right here in Oxfordshire, alongside a commitment to invest a further £1 billion in the UK. And we are creating a new AI Growth Zone in Culham to speed up planning approvals for the rapid build-out of data centres. And finally, to take this project forward at real pace… … and catalyse private sector investment into the region… … I am pleased to announce that the Deputy Prime Minister and I have asked Lord Patrick Vallance to be the champion for the Oxford Cambridge Growth Corridor. Lord Vallance has extensive experience across the sciences, academia, and government. He will work with local leaders and with the Housing and Planning Minister to deliver this exciting project… … including with Peter Freeman, who is already doing excellent work in Cambridge… … and a new Growth Commission for Oxford, which will help to accelerate growth in the city and its surrounding area. This is the government’s modern Industrial Strategy in action. With central government, local leaders and business working together… … the Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor could add up to £78 billion to the UK economy by 2035 … … driving investment, innovation and growth. Finally, I come to the decision that perhaps more than any other… … has been delayed… … has been avoided… … has been ducked. The question of whether to give Heathrow … … our only hub airport… … a third runway… … has run on for decades. The last full length runway in Britain was built in the 1940s. No progress in eighty years. Why is this so damaging? It’s because Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country. It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three-quarters of all long-haul flights in the UK go from Heathrow. Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers used Heathrow in 2023. But for decades, its growth has been constrained. Successive studies have shown that this really matters for our economy. According to the most recent study from Frontier Economics, a third runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050. Over half – 60% of that boost, would go to areas outside London and the South-East. … increasing trade opportunities for products like Scotch whiskey and Scottish salmon - already two of the biggest British exports out of Heathrow. And a third runway could create over 100,000 jobs. For international investors, persistent delays have cast doubt about our seriousness towards improving our economic prospects. Business groups, like the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Chambers of Commerce right across the UK… …as well trade unions like GMB and Unite are clear… … a third runway is badly needed. In 2018, the previous government steered its Airports National Policy Statement through parliament. But no action was taken. It simply sat on the shelf. We are taking a totally different approach to airport expansion. This Government has already given its support to expansion at City Airport and at Stansted. And there are two live decisions on Luton and Gatwick which will be made by the Transport Secretary shortly. But as our only hub airport, Heathrow is in a unique position - and we cannot duck the decision any longer. I have always been clear that a third runway at Heathrow would unlock further growth… … boost investment… … increase exports… … and make the UK more open and more connected. And now, the case is stronger than ever… … because our reforms to the economy… … like speeding up the planning system… … and our plans for modernised UK airspace… … mean the delivery of this project is set up for success. So I can confirm today that this Government supports a third runway at Heathrow… … and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer. We will then take forward a full assessment through the Airport National Policy Statement. That will ensure that the project is value for money - and our clear expectation is that any associated surface transport costs will be financed through private funding. And it will ensure that a third runway is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate obligations. Heathrow themselves are clear that their proposal for expansion will meet strict rules on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. And we are already making great strides in transitioning to cleaner and greener aviation. Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuel by around 70%. At the start of this month, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate became law. And today I can announce that we are investing £63 million into the Advanced Fuels Fund over the next year… … and we have today set out the details of how we will deliver a Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage investment into this growing industry. These measures will encourage more investors to back production in the UK, bringing good, high-skilled jobs to areas like Teesside… … demonstrating that investment in the right technology can help us deliver both our growth and our clean energy missions. Now is the moment to grasp the opportunity in front of us. By backing a third runway at Heathrow, we can make Britain the world’s best connected place to do business. That is what it takes to make bold decisions in the national interest. That is what I mean by going further and faster to kickstart economic growth. The work of change has begun. We have already made great progress. But I am not satisfied. And I know that there is more to be done. We must go further and faster if we are to build a brighter future. The prize on offer is immense. The next generation with more opportunities than the last. An engineer in Teesside, working in some of the most exciting industries of the future – from carbon capture to sustainable aviation fuel. A scientist in Milton Keynes or Bedford, working in our life sciences industry to solve some of the most important medical challenges in the world. A small business owner in Scotland, knowing that they can expand and export to new markets right across the globe. Wealth created, and wealth shared, in every part of Britain. This is a Government on the side of working people. Taking the right decisions to secure their future, to secure our future. Stepping up to the challenges we face. Ending the era of low expectations. Putting Britain on a different path. Delivering for the British people. And I am determined, this Government is determined, to do just that. Thank you.

Title: Uber-backed mobility fintech Moove acquires Brazil’s Kovi, takes ARR to $275M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber-backed Moove, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has acquired Kovi, a Brazilian urban mobility provider. The value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove. Moove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech’s annual revenue to $275 million. Last March, Moove reported a $115 million ARR. The news comes two months after Moove announced a partnership with Waymo to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Miami. Delano said Moove’s acquisition of the São Paulo-based Kovi marks a significant step toward the company’s goal of building the world’s largest rideshare fleet. What began with 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020 has now grown to 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents, with Latin America now emerging as a key market. Similarly, the acquisition unites two companies tackling the same challenge — providing financing solutions for rideshare drivers. Founded in 2018, Y Combinator-backed Kovi launched to make vehicle ownership more accessible in Brazil. Following the acquisition, pending approval from the Brazilian antitrust authority, Kovi will continue to operate under its brand while its executive and management teams will remain unchanged. While Moove will keep the Kovi brand operating in its existing markets, Brazil and Mexico, there are plans to expand further across Latin America. Moove recently launched operations in three cities across Colombia and Mexico. As such, the acquisition further cements Moove’s position in Latin America, giving the company a major foothold in Brazil, the region’s largest ride-hail market. “We’re incredibly excited about working with a fantastic team of like-minded individuals at Kovi who set up this business to address a similar problem that we found in Nigeria,” he remarked. “Kovi is one of the top two players in Brazil. So we have not just entered or strengthened our presence in the Latin American market but also put ourselves in a top-two position in the largest single market in Latin America through this acquisition.” Moove has built a third pillar in the global mobility marketplace by offering vehicle supply to ride-hailing platforms. This includes its flagship Drive-to-Own product, a taxi and employment model, and an emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) business line involving AI-driven mobility. While AI plays a key role in its AV business line, Delano says the company’s AI mobility strategy will span the entire business, from optimizing traditional ride-hailing services to improving fleet management, according to Delano. This is where the Kovi acquisition comes in. According to the chief executive, Kovi’s proprietary technology and algorithms will “complement and strengthen our existing Moove AI mobility strategy and ensure that we can start to deliver an improved service and product to our customers around the world.” It’s unclear whether Kovi was struggling financially before its acquisition by Moove. Its last known funding round was a $104 million Series B in 2021 from investors like Valor Capital, Prosus Ventures, and Quona Capital. Despite raising funds to expand across Latin America, Kovi primarily focused on Brazil. That year, it reported $45 million in ARR, growing 15% month-over-month. The all-share transaction makes Kovi’s investors shareholders in Moove, aligning their growth trajectories. In a statement, Kovi CEO Adhemar Milani Neto expressed confidence in the deal. “I met the founders [Moove’s Delano and Jide Odunsi] many years back when they were scaling their business in Africa, and I was immediately impressed by their purpose-driven approach, which is also a perfect match to our culture. Together, I believe we will become a truly global category-defining business and will leverage scale and deep expertise never seen in our market.” Moove raised a $100 million Uber-led Series B last year at a $750 million valuation. The mobility fintech has secured over $500 million in debt and equity from backers like Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Janus Henderson, and the IFC (World Bank) since its launch five years ago. Delano declined to comment on potential new fundraising efforts. Instead, he stressed that the company will focus on driving its capex-heavy business to profitability this year and realizing its vision of building the largest ride-hailing fleet globally.

Title: Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK): Is This Healthcare Stock A Good Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other healthcare stocks. Healthcare stocks are widely considered a cornerstone of a retirement portfolio due to their resilience, long-term growth potential, and ability to provide steady income through dividends. This sector encompasses pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, biotechnology firms, and medical device manufacturers, all of which are positioned to benefit from enduring trends like aging populations and advancements in medical technology. One of the most compelling reasons to include health stocks in a retirement portfolio is their defensive nature. Health care is a necessity, not a luxury, meaning demand for medical products and services remains steady, even during economic downturns. According to a report by Morningstar, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader market in 75% of US recessions over the past 50 years, demonstrating its ability to provide stability when other sectors falter. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Global demographic trends also favor health stocks. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 65 and older will double by 2050, reaching 1.5 billion. This aging population will drive increased demand for chronic disease management, prescription medications, and long-term care services. The US alone spends over $4.3 trillion annually on health care, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, accounting for nearly 20% of GDP. This figure is expected to rise to $6.8 trillion by 2030, driven by advances in medical technology and higher spending on aging-related health issues. Health stocks, particularly those of established pharmaceutical companies, often provide attractive dividend yields, making them ideal for income-focused retirees. Drug giants are known for consistently paying and increasing dividends. Dividends provide retirees with regular income, reducing the need to sell assets during market downturns. The healthcare sector is also at the forefront of technological innovation, offering exposure to high-growth areas such as biotechnology, precision medicine, and artificial intelligence in healthcare. Healthcare stocks provide diversification in a retirement portfolio as well, balancing out more volatile sectors like technology or energy. Additionally, healthcare ETFs like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund offer exposure to a wide range of companies, spreading risk while capturing growth potential. For example, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has delivered a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%, outperforming many other sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected health stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company worldwide. There are several aspects that make this company an attractive investment choice. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has achieved 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, surpassing the sector median of 2 years by 600%. Secondly, the company has also maintained 35 consecutive years of dividend payments, outperforming the sector median of 15 years by 133.33%. This shows the company’s ability to generate profit and provide value to its shareholders, which are indicators of strong financial growth. Moreover, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has also announced a $17 million commitment over five years (2025-2030) to advance equitable access to culturally responsive care for people with heart conditions in the US communities. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the healthcare stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nasdaq Files for In-Kind Redemptions for BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF

EditorCrypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun, Krisztian Sandor The Securities and Exchange Commission had previously only allowed cash redemptions when the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved last January. Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin. “It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Three events, including a $500k investment, signal that a parallel WordPress community is gaining momentum Three recent events may signal the direction in which the WordPress community is evolving and have the feel of pieces falling into place. What’s happening isn’t a change in the WordPress community itself but the emergence of a parallel one. There is movement to build a parallel community and infrastructure to WordPress. The goal is to bring stability to WordPress and ensure that it continues to be the world’s most popular content management system. Recent events related to the Automattic and Mullenweg dispute with WP Engine have given rise to actions that may in time wrest control of WordPress away from Automattic and Matt Mullenweg. This second approach of creating an alternative WordPress community gained major support from GoDaddy in the form of a half million dollar donation to the non-profit The WP Community Collective, a group whose goal is to support an independent WordPress open source ecosystem. GoDaddy explained: “GoDaddy …just invested a half-million dollars in the WordPress community through a donation to The WP Community Collective, an initiative focused on funding and empowering WordPress contributors. This monetary support will be directed towards providing financial, operational and promotional support within the greater WordPress community. The WP Community Collective contribution by GoDaddy… aims to strengthen open source communities by providing resources for designers, developers and other contributors who make the internet work.” What makes the GoDaddy funding interesting is that one of the investors in GoDaddy, BlackRock, is also an investor in Automattic. BlackRock recently lowered the value of their stake in Automattic, which is said to currently be less than one percent. The second piece of the alternative WordPress community is in the form of an investment made by Joost de Valk in an actual WordPress business community that was founded 15 years ago. Joost is turning it into a non-profit and setting it up with a governance board. According to the announcement: “…we’re excited about this community and the history that has brought Post Status to where it is – a true staple of the WordPress community where thoughts flow freely, business is done, and mutual support is abundant. …Over the past few months, it’s become very clear that Post Status is an enormously important place for the community to come together and discuss all things WordPress. A place with light moderation, but also with true freedom of speech (within the boundaries of treating everyone with respect) and the freedom to have different opinions. We want to enshrine those freedoms even more. That’s why we (Marieke and myself) will be buying Post Status” Joost de Valk, the founder of Yoast SEO plugins, has recently become an outspoken advocate of changing WordPress governance to a more democratic model and of creating a parallel WordPress structure that secures and stabilizes the distribution of WordPress themes and plugins. There have been ongoing discussions across the WordPress community about decentralizing plugin and theme distribution so that WordPress.org, which is controlled by Automattic and Matt Mullenweg, is no longer the sole source. Decentralization would remove that control by distributing software through multiple channels. Karim Marucchi (LinkedIn profile), well known in the WordPress community as a leader in enterprise WordPress development, wrote about securing the supply chain in reference to making the availability of plugin and themes secure and trustworthy. He wrote: “Securing the Supply Chain & Start Modernization The first step is to act on what Joost called Federated And Independent Repositories. It is absolutely imperative that we show the world that we have supply chain security. To create a community Plugin, we should immediately form a collaboration group between independent contributors, multiple hosting companies, agencies, and the broader product community within our ecosystems. Designed from day one to prevent any business or entity from disrupting the supply chain” Joost de Valk recently wrote about the importance of a federated repository: “We need to supplement WordPress.org updates with other sources, so that what happened to Advanced Custom Fields, can’t happen again. Lots of hosts are currently experimenting with or already putting in place mirrors of WordPress.org. This creates issues: download and active install statistics are no longer reliable, for instance. Just having mirrors of WordPress.org also doesn’t really solve the problem of a single party controlling our single update server. For that, we need to make sure that those mirrors federate with each other, and share each others data and, as Karim suggested, allow for independent plugins and themes to be hosted there, outside of the wordpress.org repository. I call this: Federated and Independent Repositories, in short: FAIR. I’m already talking to several hosts about this, and would welcome anyone who wants to join these conversations, so we’re not duplicating work.” There is now a project called AspirePress that aims to decentralize WordPress which has been gathering momentum. AspirePress intends to become a mirror repository and eventually become a decentralized distributed model, which is expressed in their motto at the top of every page: “Decentralize. Distribute. Democratize.” AspirePress is committed to being a truly open source WordPress community project: “AspirePress is a community-driven open-source project aimed at providing resources and tools to improve the lives of WordPress developers everywhere. We are focused on building a package mirror to freely distribute plugins and themes to WordPress users, no matter who or where they are.” AspirePress is an example of people in the WordPress community taking steps to decentralize WordPress so that one entity can’t unilaterally take over someone else’s plugin and replace it with their own as Automattic and Matt Mullenweg did to WP Engine’s highly popular ACF plugin which was completely replaced with a renamed version controlled by Automattic. Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were Stanford university students who at a certain point decided that it was in their company’s best interest to bring in a CEO with experience to take over and that’s what happened. Google’s founders still remained involved in the company but CEO seat was filled by someone else who was trustworthy. Google’s one of the largest and most influential companies in the world and is an example of founders who successfully relinquished control to more experienced hands. So it’s not like there is no precedent of a company founder who successfully handed control to someone else in order to grow the company. There are other examples in the open source community as well: These examples of successful transitions in for-profit and open-source organizations demonstrate that change in leadership and control can lead to growth. The three developments discussed in this article reflect the gradual shifts occurring in WordPress, a platform that supports thousands of jobs and generates billions in revenue worldwide. Stakeholders invested in WordPress’s stability may see these developments as steps toward that goal.

Governor Michl advocates Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid increasing institutional adoption across the world. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will reportedly propose adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets, Financial Times reported on Jan. 29. If approved, his plan would see the bank eventually allocate as much as 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves to Bitcoin, moving beyond its traditional gold and US dollar holdings. Earlier this month, he hinted at potential adjustments to the bank’s reserve strategy, suggesting a broader approach to asset allocation. Bitwise’s European Head of Research, André Dragosch, said the proposed investment could amount to $7.3 billion in Bitcoin. This would place CNB’s BTC reserves above its $4.3 billion gold holdings and account for roughly 5.3 months of newly mined Bitcoin. Dragosch said: “Czech central bank holds around 146 billion USD in official reserve assets of which 138 billion USD are FX reserves and 4.3 billion USD are gold. They plan to invest up to 5% of these reserves into BTC (approximately 7.3 billion USD / ~71,568 BTC).” CNB’s Michl sees Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid rising institutional adoption. He pointed to growing interest in crypto-related investment products, particularly after asset managers like BlackRock launched BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He also noted shifting US policies, including President Donald Trump‘s deregulation efforts and increased engagement between crypto firms and policymakers. Under the Trump administration, the US has adopted a more friendly disposition to the emerging industry and recently signed an executive order designed to make America a leader in the sector. Michl said: “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good…Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” Although Bitcoin remains volatile, Michl believes its rising adoption justifies its inclusion in national reserves. He acknowledged the risks but emphasized the CNB’s experience in managing fluctuating assets. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value . . . but in our history we have also had some stocks like Enron or the payment company Wirecard, so we have some experience with bad investments, so, yes, I’m ready [for a possible Bitcoin collapse],” he said.

Title: Trump Dumps the Paris Agreement: Is it a Big Deal?
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/29/trump-dumps-the-paris-agreement-is-it-a-big-deal/

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change by Tilak Doshi From THE DAILY SCEPTIC According to the UK’s Telegraph, just hours after President Trump issued executive orders to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”. The tendentiousness of the Telegraph’s headline is remarkable. Just who is this mere Department Secretary to “warn” the Chief Executive of the world’s leading economic and military power of anything? Evidently, the British Secretary is deluded enough to take up the mantle of responsibility to warn President Trump of ignorance in energy affairs. But Mr Miliband has company, ranging from leading academics to senior global leaders conferring at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos. Rather than simply dismissing his antics as another sign of Mad Ed’s silly climate posturing, it behoves us to take his warning at face value. Is the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement really such a big deal? Appearing before the House of Lords Environment and Climate Change Committee a day after President Trump’s inauguration, Mr Miliband sought to downplay the impact of America’s planned withdrawal from the international climate treaty which Mr. Trump had announced on the same day. He said Other countries believed it was in their national self-interest to remain in the Paris Agreement and to continue working on these (climate) issues, because they saw both the advantages of moving forward on this and the dangers for them of not moving forward. So I think the transition is unstoppable, not fast enough, but unstoppable. Presumably, M. Miliband was referring to Mr Trump’s previous withdrawal from the Paris agreement during his first term in office from January 2017, a move which was promptly reversed by President Joe Biden in January 2021. President Biden’s administration reversed almost every energy initiative of the previous administration. It sought to portray the first exit from the Paris agreement – and Mr Trump’s first-term Presidency – as an aberration from the liberal-progressive ‘arc of history’. After all, as it was widely claimed by the Democrat establishment and its media shills, wasn’t the Trump win in 2016 only made possible by Russian collusion? In 2017, when Mr Trump first gave notice of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, a statutory delay of four years from the date of the agreement coming into force in November 2016 applied. In effect, the US was out of the agreement for only a few months before Trump’s first term Presidency expired. This time around, the statutory delay is one year. Thus from 2026 onwards, at least to the end of Mr Trump’s second term, the US will be not participate in any of the Paris agreement commitments including any financial obligations. The US thus remained a party to the Paris agreement for almost the entirety of President Trump’s first term, during which its administrative staff continued participating in programmes and initiatives that were pursued under the Obama Presidency. The US State Department continued to participate in the ongoing negotiations, including co-chairing with China the Enhanced Transparency Framework. At the COP29 UN annual climate summit held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in the shadow of Trump’s triumphant election win, Mr John Podesta – President Biden’s Climate Envoy – had no hesitation in telling governments around the world to “keep faith” in their efforts to “combat global warming”. He confidently asserted that the Trump Presidency could only slow, not stop, the transition from fossil fuels: For those of us dedicated to climate action, last week’s outcome in the United States is obviously bitterly disappointing. … But what I want to tell you today is that while the United States federal Government, under Donald Trump, may put climate action on the back burner, the work to contain climate change is going to continue in the United States. Gina McCarthy, President Obama’s Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and later the White House Climate Adviser for President Biden, accused the Trump administration of having “abdicated its responsibility to protect the American people and our national security” by leaving the Paris Agreement. Now representing an environmental NGO, Ms McCarthy assured her audience that “our states, cities, businesses and local institutions stand ready to pick up the baton of US climate leadership and do all they can — despite federal complacency — to continue the shift to a clean energy economy”. The belief that the global climate agenda signified by the Paris agreement is undiminished despite the re-election of Donald Trump is not restricted to US Democrat and environmental NGO activists. At last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: The coming years will be vital well beyond Europe. All continents will have to speed up the transition towards Net Zero and deal with the growing burden of climate change. …The Paris Agreement continues to be the best hope for all humanity. So Europe will stay the course and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming. President Trump’s second term is unlikely to repeat the mistakes of his first one. He has taken a sledgehammer approach to replacing Democrat activists in Government with staff more inclined to his ‘MAGA’ vision. President Trump has long said he believes the biggest mistake he made during his first term was hiring people disloyal to his campaign promises. Harvard University’s Robert Stavins – a leading academic who has done decades of research and published extensively on international climate negotiations – seems to find it disappointing that “Trump now seems determined to purge the upper ranks for the executive branch of anyone other than loyalists”. As if an incoming President would seek to hire disloyal staff! Few would disagree with White House spokesman Steven Cheung, who said that: “No one should be surprised that those being hired should align with the mission of the administration. Nobody in private industry would ever hire someone who isn’t mission focused, and the Government should be no different.” Brian McCormack, Chief of Staff to National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, finds President Trump’s hiring decisions similarly unexceptional: “Every President is entitled to have a staff and the advisers that he needs to implement the goals that the American people elected him to pursue.” President Trump’s detractors have suggested that despite his pulling the US out of the Paris agreement, it will matter little to the global climate agenda. The ‘show must go on’ and true believers will step in to the breach. Thus, last week’s Reuters headline about billionaire climate warrior Michael Bloomberg who “steps in to help fund UN climate body after Trump withdrawal”. Climate alarmists Ed Miliband, Ursula von der Leyen, Gina McCarthy and Michael Bloomberg share an underlying presumption that the energy transition away from fossil fuels to the brave new world of renewable energy and ‘clean tech’ is made inevitable because ‘markets demand it’ and technological change has made it possible. In the great moral crusade to ‘save the planet’, they share the fatal conceit that what they want is what the world needs. Yet, Trump’s second term takes place in a vastly changed world from his first. The rise of populist parties in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland, France, Germany and the UK – dismissed as the ‘far Right‘ by the mainstream media – in a Europe stricken with deindustrialisation and recession has fundamentally altered the policy presumptions that held sway just a few years ago. Ms Von der Leyen’s own party, a constituent of the European Parliament’s EPP which is the EU’s most influential political group, is now recommending a freeze of the CO2 duty, abolishing renewable energy targets and reverting to pre-2019 ‘green wave’ policies. If Brussels is looking shaky in its anti-Trump predilections, the world of international business seems to have collapsed like a house of cards in its previous trumpeting of the ESG agenda. The ESG movement, a crucial pillar in the business sector’s buy-in of the Paris agreement, has had a series of reversals recently. The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Climate Action 100+, which pushed ESG goals and decarbonisation of the American economy, suffered a flurry of high-profile exits by companies such as BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management company. “More than 70 companies have left woke ESG organisations like NZAM and Climate Action 100+ since the Committee’s investigation started,” Republican Jim Jordan told the Daily Wire. The Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) was established in April 2021 under the auspices of the United Nations and its champion Mark Carney, the ‘rock star central banker‘. It was dedicated to helping lenders reduce their carbon footprints. The group has been abandoned in quick succession by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley. The ESG colossus, which seemed to have reigned supreme in business boardrooms the world over in the past decade, has now been irretrievably compromised. The adage ‘go woke, go broke‘ was right on target. No, the markets do not drive the so-called energy transition and technological change obeys the laws of physics and economics. For instance, in the transportation sector, neither markets nor technology has made electric vehicles affordable or popular. Within hours of being sworn into the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order meant to end policies supporting EVs. In his inauguration speech, Mr Trump said: “We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. … In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.” President Trump has not only given Americans their freedom to buy cars of their choice, a very big deal in that country. He has also eased bureaucrat-imposed efficiency standards for dishwashers, showerheads, refrigerators, laundry machines, toilets, gas cookers, incandescent lights and the like. Mr Trump, in short, has rescued the American consumer from the dead hand of an impoverishing green ideology that yields ultimate power to an efficiency technocracy. These measures are part of President Trump’s flurry of executive orders which remove regulatory obstacles to the rapid development of fossil fuel resources and all associated infrastructure while seeking to prevent wind farms from being built on federal lands and waters. President Trump’s executive order for the US to exit the Paris agreement is a huge deal, not least in saving the nation hundreds of millions of dollars which would have been spent on climate boondoggles such as President Biden’s euphemistically termed Inflation Reduction Act and vast transfers in climate funds pledged to developing countries.

Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe “…co-chairing with China the Enhanced Transparency Framework.”? China, the world’s largest producer of carbon pollution (and probably the largest producer of actual pollution), all while producing the most equipment for Green Energy, has no interest whatsoever in transparency. This revelation, by Dr. Doshi, is sufficient justification for resigning from the Paris accord. Dr. Doshi is also right on about Trump house-cleaning in his second Administration. And that’s the rub. The people that think they can control the weather by eliminating fossil fuel CO2 emissions cannot even reduce let alone eliminate those emissions. Global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have continued to rise over the last 30 years and at best, may be looking at those emissions leveling off in the next 5-10 years. It’s a complete farce. Pied piper Xi is happy to lead his useful idiots off the net zero cliff. The US greenies do not know it yet, but they are in free-fall, because Trump will systematically take away their $lollipops, by installing people loyal to MAGA, which means getting out the chainsaw and cut, cut, cut. When the greenies hit bottom, they will splatter into the dust of awful history Not to mention disbanding the Climate Youth Corps or whatever it actually is called. That group reminds me of 1930s Germany. Biden’s henchmen are Nazis. Yes, he is! Xi must be shocked at how easy it is to manipulate Western politicians. And no doubt, is very happy about it as it makes his job easier. But,now he is going to have to deal with Trump. Which might end up working out for all concerned. Trump is a Game Changer. Game Changer, yes, but first he has to disrupt the status quo, which he is doing vigorously. Xi will not lead his useful idiots off the cliff. He’s smarter than that. What he will do is to lead his useful idiots up to edge of the cliff and then give them a shove. After his useful idiots are gone, he will be the only man standing and he can do whatever he wants to do. With India increasing like China had and the rest of the underdeveloped world playing catch up, 5-10 years is unrealistic. Emissions will continue from China at 35–40% of global emissions until India surpasses them around 2060. Emissions will likely increase unabated until well past 2100. All the better for the Biome! “It’s a complete farce.” Yes, it is. There is no “carbon pollution.” Please stop spreading propaganda by adopting their falsehoods as part of your language. Word play is what the ****s are good at. There is Carbon Pollution though in the form of Soot. Black Soot that can cover part of the surface of Greenland yearly and is responsible for some ice melt. But CO2 is not Carbon anymore than H2O is Hydrogen Please notice that I qualified the “carbon pollution” meme by using the term “real pollution”, as a reference to smog, smoke, industrial acids, covid, etc. Lot’s of vocabulary used by the Climate Syndicate is bogus and we all need to stop giving them credibility by using their words. Control the words, control the ideas. — K. Marx Industrial wind facility does not equal a “farm” Same with using “gender” when the meaning is “sex”. A favourite quote of mine from Alice in Wonderland — which is where a lot of climate maniacs seem to live: When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.””The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.””The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “Which is to be master—that’s all.” As Uncle Karl said, “control the words, control the ideas”! Orwell warned us as well. I agree and we can help stop this but dumping the “Green House Gas effect” meme in favor of “Infrared Absorption effect” or “IA effect” for short. We can go with “Infrared Absorption and Emission effect” (or IAE effect for short). I’d stay away from “IRA effect” for obvious reasons. :-)…. Personally I’m using “IA effect” because its the absorption that matters as its about ‘storing the incoming energy in the earth system’. Once you get there than its one step more to identify that the earth system stores the energy in multiple ways not just via IA. And of course its one more step to demonstrate a minor change in the system that allows for more of the Sun’s energy to be available to store (the Albedo changing) can explain all the supposed increase in the stored energy. Long story short we need to use the proper language to properly educate not confuse and obfuscate. The climate doomers rely on an ‘uneducated populace’ to push their hoax. Proper language and concepts educate people, and an educated population is serious trouble to socialists/doomers. Control the words, control the ideas I can’t find any reference to that being an actual quote from Karl Marx. Can you point it out for us? Marx did claim that the “ruling class” maintains their power by shaping social consciousness through the way they use language. So I think it’s true that Marxists applied the theory of manipulating language that Marx originally claimed was a tactic of the capitalists oppressing the workers. For example, Saul Alinsky observed in Rules for Radicals (1971): He who controls the language controls the masses It’s also a theme of George Orwell’s novel 1984 (1948) although from an anti-Marxist point of view: Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? It’s similar to how today’s Green activists seem to cultivate perverted aspects of religion to manipulate people into accepting sacrifices for Net Zero, in line with Marx’s view that religion is the opiate of the masses. I’m not trying to be difficult. I agree that Marxism is a disastrous evil. It’s double-plus-ungood to use the Newspeak. But it’s not a good way to influence people to misrepresent the ideas of those whom we oppose. Marx was commenting on what he thought to be the unjust actions of the ruling class, not recommending a new approach for communists to control the masses. Socialist followers of Marx such as Stalin and Hitler applied the theory to their goal of becoming and remaining the ruling class. In a similar vein, we often see quotations from Hitler (actually Goebbels) about repeating a big lie often enough that it will be believed. But the original quote is taken out of context to make it seem that the Germans were so depraved as to be receptive to Nazis openly proposing telling lies to manipulate the public. In this case it was supposedly the Jews who were employing that tactic. And also quite similarly, Nazis actually ended up doing what they claimed that their enemies were doing. If you’re not seeing where I’m going with this, it is that “the truth will set you free”. We should never use any form of deception to influence others, If we misrepresent the thoughts and words of our enemies, those whom we hope to influence may discover our deception (which I will charitably assume is usually just an innocent error), and may conclude that nothing we say is true. Fair enough. Although that quote is often (in error) attributed to Marx. I did not do my homework. It is Carbon Dioxide Enhancement. MAGA will lead to CO2 enhancement to promote growth of flora and fauna, which increases greenery all over the world and increases crop yields to feed hungry people. What is not to like?. Net-Zero by 2050 is a Suicide Pact “Dr. Doshi is also right on about Trump house-cleaning in his second Administration.” Yes, he is. Most of the people Trump is firing are Democrats. They are the “Swamp”. Trump is draining the Swamp. In this last presidential election, in Washington DC, Harris and the Democrats got 93 percent of the vote, and Trump got seven percent of the vote. That ought to tell you just how big the Swamp is in Washington DC. It needs a lot of draining. Yes, excellent article, Dr. Doshi. And never, never agree to making D.C. at State [with 2 Senators & 1 Rep.]. If they need representation in Congress, we should cede all the non-government used land [ie the residential areas] back to Virginia &/or Maryland where it came from. Today it is just Maryland. Virginia pulled out during the great war of Secession. One thing that is quite clear is the fact that Flywheel Miliband and his ilk do not live in the world as we know it. In the UK we are going in the opposite direction to Trump, most notably on freedom of speech [and thought]. The big thing – thus far – is to label opponents… All part of controlling people. “Apparently, complaints of ‘two-tier policing’ are one example of a ‘right-wing extremist narrative’.” https://www.spiked-online.com/2025/01/28/outraged-by-grooming-gangs-youre-an-extremist/ By that token opposing net zero makes one instantly right wing, a fascist etc. “In a recent study, CSSN Scholar Matthew Paterson delves into the emergence of “anti-net zero populism” in the UK, analyzing how right-wing populists use discourse to undermine climate policies and the net-zero emissions target across various policy areas.” https://cssn.org/the-rise-of-anti-net-zero-populism-in-the-uk-comparing-rhetorical-strategies-for-climate-policy-dismantling/ You can’t have a serious discussion with the 6th form student protest brigades, in or out of office. Thinking for yourself? That’s a far-right idea for a start. And the science is settled. News that amuses Rachel Reeves is set to deliver her much-touted ‘growth’ speech in Oxfordshire this morning after months of economic woes— […] Reeves will warn that “growth will not come without a fight”—a fight that’s looking to be against her own Cabinet. She’s expected to back airport expansion, including at Gatwick, Luton, and Heathrow. Tractors and protesting farmers have turned up outside Reeves’ event in Oxford. Starmer is in the Times likening himself to Thatcher again. Another reset… By reaching a negative rating of -41 Starmer has beat Rishi’s lowest ever point of -41 at the time of the election. When asked to describe Starmer in one word, respondents where most likely to choose: “Useless,” “Liar,” and “Bad.” https://order-order.com/#_@/wJLubnJnb8s3yA Of course, they will continue to delude themselves Emma Barnett (BBC) cut in: “And contribute to climate change with an extra runway?” She pointed to eco-entrepreneur and Labour donor Dale Vince’s attacks on the plan, after he called it “an illusion of growth”. But Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said he still believes there is “no tension” between the UK’s climate goals and the possibility of Heathrow expansion. “No tension? How is an extra runway no tension?” Barnett replied. He said there would be the same emissions, and “people are still going to fly”. The presenter hit back: “You don’t expect emissions to go up if there’s an extra runway?” Reynolds said Labour is committed to decarbonising aviation. https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/minister-no-tension-between-airport-expansion-and-climate-goals_uk_6799d83ce4b01949837eefe9 Here endeth the lesson. This reminded me of the alternative fab four – The Rutles. Did you ever get the feeling That the truth is less revealing Than a downright lie? The Starmer government should be declared persona non grata in the US for the next 4 years and 8 more years under Vance, for actively trying to make America worse again, MAWA “analyzing how right-wing populists use discourse to undermine climate policies” The only reason “discourse” is effective is because the discourse amounts to skeptics saying climate alarmists don’t have evidence that CO2 does what they claim it does, and since the climate alarmists *don’t* have any evidence, the discourse is effective. When you say show us the evidence, and the other side can’t come up with any evidence, then the impartial observer has to think there must not be any evidence to substantiated the climate crisis claims. Climate Alarmists have no evidence to back up their claims of climate change doom. THAT is their problem, not skeptic discourse about it. The problem surrounding discourse is that in the realm of activism subjectivity rules. Mere consensus, even the illusion of it, is treated as evidence. Speculation is accorded the status of solidity, and the act of questioning is perceived as violence. When you present data refuting a claim, “Yes it is!” is considered a sufficient response. Reason and logic have no hold on such a paradigm. Good comment. It’s not so much what the USA does which undermines Net Zero; it’s China. While emissions have been falling in the USA, they have been rising in China. And that rise sems likely to continue. So the UK can continue to reduce its measly one percent contribution to global emissons. The EU can continue doing the same. But at the end of the day global emissions will continue to rise. And Ed Milliband can jump up and down and wave his arms up and down and it will make absolutely no difference. Not forgetting India. As goes China So goes India And the rest of the developing world to follow Nobody ever mentions Africa. Africa has scarcely begun emitting CO₂ Funny that China, the second largest economy and second largest population in the world is classified as “developing” and therefore exempt. It’s not funny at all. It was planned that way by western politicians. Think about it. China is a 6000 year old culture with nuclear weapons and a space program and is only called “developing” by western nations who think they own the world. Not exactly, unless you view the UN as western only. If Ed jumps up and down and waves his arms fast enough he can become his own personal wind turbine and that will show them! But the sub-text in so many comments (right across the board, not solely on WUWT) is the implication that China and India should not be allowed to pollute when the rest of us are doing our best to “save the planet”. “The planet” has been around a lot longer than we have and the idea that the planet needs ‘saving’ or that humanity can do anything effective towards that end is hubris of the first order. And things aren’t improved when we don’t (most of us) properly understand what we are supposed to be doing. You refer twice to ‘global emissions’. Your one percent is 1% of 3% of 0.042% which is the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. We could treble our emissions and the planet would not notice the difference except that it would be greener and crop yields would be better. The ’emissions’ associated with mining and processing rare earth minerals for wind turbines, not to mention the construction, shipping, installation of those things and the environmental damage they cause are a different matter and that is what should be concerning us. CO2 is an irrelevance as far as climate is concerned. And to be honest, so are we! story tip In First White House Briefing, Youngest Press Secretary Ever Eschews TraditionPress secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would open the briefing room to bloggers, podcasters and social-media influencers https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/drones-influencers-and-medicaid-what-to-know-about-the-first-white-house-briefing-of-trumps-second-term-4446b719?mod=hp_lista_pos2 To eliminate the monopoly of the leftist-biased Corporate Media, which is decades overdue Karoline Leavitt went into the news conference without a briefing book. She had all the answers in her head. She also knew the names of all the reporters in the room. I thought she did a good job. She needs to relax a little. I’m sure she will as she gets used to the job. Not too many “gotcha! questions” from the reporters. They seem to be handling the situation the way a legitimate reporter should be handling it. So far. The Trump Juggernaut has them a little intimidated. Heritage Foundation? From the article: “According to the UK’s Telegraph, just hours after President Trump issued executive orders to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”.” I bet Trump got a good laugh out of that. Trump will be visiting the UK shortly, and he and Miliband can discuss it. Miliband will end up looking like the Mayor of Los Angeles after her conversation with Trump last week. She couldn’t agree with Trump fast enough, she was so intimidated by Trump, and the truth he was speaking. Trump will lay a little truth on Miliband, too. The Paris accord won’t be able to do much without US cash. From the article: “Other countries believed it was in their national self-interest to remain in the Paris Agreement and to continue working on these (climate) issues, because they saw both the advantages of moving forward on this and the dangers for them of not moving forward. So I think the transition is unstoppable, not fast enough, but unstoppable.” This is why the UK is going down the Net Zero Road to Ruin. Their politicians look at the world this way, and see no option but to install windmills and solar and battery backup even though it should be obvious by this time to a rational person that windmills, solar, and battery storage are not fit for the purpose of powering human society. They are, in fact, detrimental to human society. From the Telegraph; too little, too late? Lord Mandelson: I was wrong to call Trump a danger to the world ﻿ Lol Wonderful to see Mandelson grovelling…. Ed Miliband, the British Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, “warned” Mr Trump that the rise of Net Zero is “unstoppable”. Nothing to worry about. ﻿Ed’s referring to the number of brain cells he (Ed) possesses Other Countries Believed… Most of those “Other Countries” are receiver nations from the climate graft fund that the US was required to be one of the few “Funding Countries” From the article: “The belief that the global climate agenda signified by the Paris agreement is undiminished despite the re-election of Donald Trump is not restricted to US Democrat and environmental NGO activists.” This is called “Whistling past the graveyard”. Three cheers for Trump. Three boos for Minibrain whose Net Zero plans spell poverty for nil return. My understanding is the Paris Accord is an international treaty that was never ratified by the US Senate and is, therefore, non-binding. The delay for exit is contrary to US Treaties per the Constitution. If it was never ratified, it was never binding from the beginning. This is another case where Presidents have overreached and ignored the Constitution and the US Senate failed in their responsibility of checks and balances. I still believe that this Paris agreement should be submitted to the Senate and voted down for a lack of 2/3 majority. After that happens, throw it into the burn bin that provides heat for the Capitol. I concur. Presidents Executive powers . You may have heard of that in last few days The Paris Accord is wrong in its reasoning but the President can and does sign treatys that are binding. Thats why Trump had to ‘legally undo’ the original binding agreement by Obama The President can enter into an executive agreement (which can include a treaty as that term is used in international law). This can be: a. A “Congressional-Executive” or “legislative-executive” agreement, made by the President under authority granted by Congress under an existing statute; or b. A “sole executive agreement,” created under the President’s own constitutional authority to “take care” that the United States’ laws be faithfully enforced (U.S. Constitution, Art II, § 3) and under the bundle of Constitutional responsibilities collectively referred to as the President’s foreign affairs power (See U.S. Constitution, Art. II, §§ 1, 2, 3; United States 11 Foreign Affairs Manual § 723.2- 2(C)). That took a deep dive. Well done. Note that it is in the context that the US laws can be faithfully enforced. The Paris accord, standing on its own, is not a US law unless/until Congress passes the applicable legislation. As the term is used in international law. That is not the same as in the US Constitution. The Paris Accord is defined as an international treaty. Biden signed an executive order effecting agreement, but that is not the same as ratification, which requires Advice and Consent of the US Senate. As such, it is not Constitutionally binding, nor does it automatically become US Law, which ratified treaties do. As such, all Trump needed to do is exactly what he did. Issue an executive order ending Biden’s agreement. Since it was not a treaty ratified by the US, the US can just walk away. If the UN or other organization wants to sue, let them try. The US is not bound to the ICC, so it will be an interesting read as the drama unfolds. The UN and all of its minions will be wise not to push too hard. After all, the lion’s share of funding comes from US tax dollars and should they push too hard, they might find themselves on a street corner selling pencils. “Mr Trump, in short, has rescued the American consumer from the dead hand of an impoverishing green ideology” Actually Trump has rescued all Americans from the socialist liberal tyranny of the Democrat Party and its prior dictators. If we succeed in Making America Great Again, does it not follow that this success creates opportunities to Make the World Great Again? Curious minds are asking…. I think so. Success is infectious. A successful leader shows the way, and then others take up the quest, after the leader has shown them what can be done, and how it can be done. The freeze on Federal grants has been reversed. Yes another memo went rescinding the earlier one Trumpanzees dont keep up, thats not ‘sucess’ ‘In the memo distributed to federal agencies, Matthew J. Vaeth, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, states that OMB memorandum M-25-13 “is rescinded.” That order, issued Monday, instructed federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance.” Why the need for insults? Only the few wealthy countries of Germany, Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, other EU countries, and the USA, representing less than one of the eight billion on Planet Earth, that have “green” agendas, are mandating social changes to achieve net zero emissions in their “small worlds within this planet“. And not one of them has called for the elimination of concrete and termites, two of the biggest sources of global atmospheric CO2. Termites also emit lots of methane. Humans emit about 8 billions pounds of CO2 everyday. To this add the amount of CO from domestic animals. We can not get complacent. Trump’s efforts will likely be important for the next 4 years but these crazies pushing the climate hoax are well funded, well organized and very deep in to the political spectrum. Consider just how crazy and devoted you have to be to promulgate the biggest hoax ever on the human population. Barnham of “Barnham & Bailey” fame must be laughing in his grave. The ability of these crazies to be able to convince a significant portion of the population that a trace gas, absolutely necessary for all life on the planet is a ‘pollutant’ that will end all life instead of growing it is amazing. The power of telling a lie over & over again is demonstrated by this hoax. Of course the goal isn’t to ‘save the planet’, its to ‘control the masses’ and socialists will use anything at their disposal to do that. I’ve never much expected politicians to ‘do the right thing’, but they need to step up and not just role back regulations but step-by-step put a dagger in to this hoax. Demonstrating through the climate crazies own words that Net Zero has NOTHING to do with ‘saving the planet’ but about ‘controlling the masses’ (they’ve said it time and again, USE those words!). With the US withdrawing from the Paris Accords, this means that the top 3 countries in terms of CO2 emissions, are all ignoring them. Burying the Paris Accords in a crossroads with a stake in its heart is apparently needed. Submitting the Accords as a formal treaty to the Senate would lead to its formal rejection. Not required . Presidents executive powers suffice especially the foreign affairs powers. The senate only gets the minor treaties these days such as this during Trumps time The reason Paris was not submitted as a treaty is that Obama knew quite well there was no way he could have gotten two thirds in the Senate. The Democrats sit still for that dimunition of the power of the Senate, as they approved of the content, and the Republicans tend to be wussies. John Roberts is very cautious, and “conservative” in the worst sense. Cartoons of DT always seem to add 20 lbs. Must be “fatism”. he is obese. Just the image people told him years ago to wear dark loose suits Except on golf course Ideology whiplash. Had there been a legal vote in America in 2020 we wouldn’t be going through this. I get the feeling that Trump is going to fully investigate the 2020 vote to calm his ego and get the truth out. The 50-60 Trump legal challenges all failed. The recounts all confirmed the original result. The Arizona senate Audit came to the same result. For the 2016 election Trump had his own blue ribbon commission to prove that he won the popular vote . He didnt. Same voting machines or mail ballots and process this time gave the clear winner , just as in 2020, just it wasnt Harris As for mail ballot fraud One such instance took place in North Carolina in the 2018 midterms when Leslie McCrae Dowless, a political operative working for Republican House candidate Mark Harris “defrauded voters by collecting unfilled ballots and then filling in the rest of it to favor the campaign’s candidate,” according to a report from MIT’s Election Lab. As a result of the incident, a new election was held, and Dowless was convicted of fraud in 2020 99.22 Million Ballots Processed in the 2024 General Election https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2024/1202-usps-releases-2024-post-election-analysis-report.htm Duker, the court cases on the 2020 election were all decided on the basis of either laches, the case should have been brought earlier in the process, i.e. before the election, or on standing. No cases were decided on the merits. Extensive use of unvetted mail-in ballots and same day registration led to a lack of any chain of custody. Wisconsin had a literally unbelievable growth in turnout, for example. But you know that, and are gaslighting. “No cases were decided on the merits.” That’s right. I bet duker knows that. So he is spreading disinformation. Add to it that only something like 17 of the something like 67 claims ever made it before a judge, none of which were decided on merit. Very nice. I will say it again no committee, council, bureaucracy, agency or any other gaggle of humans can come close to a lightly regulated free market. It couldn’t be more clear. Let us buy and use the things we want produced in a safe and clean manner and life will be grand. To hell with all those worthless government entities. It’s about time that the US made such action official, anyway. These climate agreements and COP conferences have been accomplishing next to nothing anyway since, among other things, the planet still depends on 82% of its primary energy generation on fossil fuels, while China , India and much of the developing world are still constructing coal plants. At the same time, even though Canada and the US liked to talk about their progress in introducing renewables, last year both set new highs in oil extraction and production. Canada is a classic example of a country that talks a good game about some sort of green transition. Yet during the last two decades it has achieved only 20% of its 2030 emissions-reduction target and might need as much as another 75 years to do so, which won’t bother most citizens in the least. So with such overall global lack of commitments, the Paris deal’s chances of success, like its predecessors’, was a long shot from the outset. Two points for Mr Miliband: 1 The US has done more to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions than almost any other country. https://www.epa.gov/system/files/images/2024-04/total-ghg-over-time-2024.p2g ht2., 2. Forcing development is often dangerous and is always very expensive. Its wasnt a 4 year statuary delay but 3 years It was Trump that added the extra time by not starting the clock till Jun 2017 Even though the agreement was signed in December 2015, the treaty only came into force on 4 November 2016, 30 days after at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it. No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification. No country could give notice to leave the agreement until three years had passed from the date of ratification. True, but the US did not formally ratify it as a treaty. Maybe it’s all for the best, and the crash will propel the eevil populist nationalists into power in Europe. And Ed Miliband will go down as the prototype of the politician that literally understands nothing. Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: Ten Greek CEOs making global history

Time Published: 2025-01-29T09:03:15Z
Full Content:
At a time when the rate of replacement of CEOs in large corporations worldwide has skyrocketed to historic highs (1,800 layoffs or voluntary departures between October 2023 – October 2024 were recently reported by “Financial Times”), Greek or Greek-born CEOs are not only staying in their positions, but new ones are being added. From the most influential across the international business world, such as Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase or Ron Vachris of Costco and Albert Bourla of Pfizer, to new entrants such as Duke Energy’s Harry Sideris, the Greeks and Greek heads of multinational conglomerates and national business leaders of major economies, e.g. Germany, Australia, etc, have proved resilient. They have managed to adapt and successfully reshape the business plans of the huge companies they lead in the rapidly changing economic, commercial and business environment. In conditions of long-term inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and constant turmoil in supply chains, Greek leaders are withstanding the relentless competition and moving forward…All of them are writing their own chapter now in international business developments, all over the globe. Their main weapons include excellent training, creative spirit, flexibility and adaptability, as well as strong personal ambition, elements that make up the profile of a successful CEO. Many are quick to associate their successful careers with the Greek DNA, which means combativeness, perseverance in the goal, ability to survive in adverse conditions. What is certain is that these are indeed common elements that are found in everyone’s individual success story. And some of them do justice to their Greek roots, as they exert their influence in the implementation of significant investments in our country. Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou – LVMH Fashion Group Mr Fendi On March 5, 2024, on the day of his birthday, one of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnaud called one of his close associates, the Greek-born Pierre-Emanuel Angeloglou, and gave him a great gift: he announced his promotion to CEO of several brands in his empire. He’s the new CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, which houses brands like Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Stella McCartney, Patou and Off-White. He comes from L’Oreal, where he rose to the top of its hierarchy as its global general manager in 2017-19. At that time, the company’s active cosmetics business saw record sales growth of +15.5%. In 2019, however, the resourceful Arnaud has thrown him into the deep end at Louis Vuitton as director of strategic missions, in charge of fashion and leather goods. In 2022, he became deputy general manager and executive vice president. His responsibilities include men’s products, where during his tenure revenues soared to €5 billion, as well as women’s accessories, digital innovation, communications, and events. The latter two areas are vital for a company with more than 50 million followers on its Instagram and TikTok accounts. A new surprise for Angeloglou followed. At the end of May last year, it was announced that he was personally taking on the role of CEO of Fendi. And many don’t believe that the next internal restructuring of Louis Vuitton patriarch Bernard Arnaud (who will hold the reins until 2029, before handing it over to his five children) will likely elevate him even higher, to the position of CEO of the giant. After all, he is a “multinational”, as he speaks seven languages, and now has all the necessary credentials. However, he doesn’t speak Greek. Ron Vachis – Costco From forklift driver COSCO, the Chinese giant that manages the port of Piraeus, and Costco, little known in Greece, are separated by just one… “t”. But also an abyss of tens of billions of dollars. The just 42-year-old American retailer is a multinational giant, spread across dozens of countries, with 890 warehouses/stores, operating mainly through the membership/subscriber system and with revenues last year of $254 billion. Third largest global retailer, behind only Walmart and Target Corporation, at No. 12 in the Fortune-500. Its big competitive advantage is its private label products, discount prices and subscription system. And with 333,000 employees, led by a Greek-born, highly capable manager. His name is Ron Vachris. He took over as president and CEO of Costco in January 2024, having previously, for 28 years, worked his way up through all ranks. Starting as a seasonal forklift driver (!) while studying Business Administration at Glendale Community College in Arizona, he climbed all the rungs to the top. He is the epitome of technocratic genius, hard work, perseverance, and immense modesty. “Throughout the company, there are many like me. But there is only one CEO position, so I happened to be in it,” he said recently. Lucky? Costco shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, and others) probably think differently to set him apart from the rest of the executives at the company, whose doctrine is to elevate its leaders from within. The 60-year-old Vachris works in an office on the 9th floor of Costco’s headquarters, just a little larger than his colleagues. His favorite spot in the new building, in a city of just 40,000 people called “Issaquah,” in Seattle, Washington state, is the ground-floor cafeteria, where he socializes with employees. Last year’s earnings topped $12.5 million. He was born in Staten Island, New York, and moved to Arizona as a teenager. He and his 58-year-old wife, Kim, have two boys, 37 and 33, a daughter, 26, and a granddaughter. Constantina Kanellopoulou – Deutsche Wohnen S.A. Leader in real estate Konstantina Kanellopoulou, 42, has been one of the heavyweights of the German real estate market in recent years. A senior executive at Vonovia for seven years since 2014, she became co-managing director of Deutsche Wohnen S.A. on January 1, 2022, when her company was acquired for €19.1 billion by the country’s real estate leader, which manages more than half a million properties. After a productive stint as co-CEO for DW, she moved in August 2023 to become chairman and CEO at subsidiary GSW Immobilien AG, which celebrated 100 years in business last year. GSW owns around 61,000 residential units in Berlin and is focused on long-term management of rental apartments. Its real estate portfolio is valued at around EUR 3,3 billion. In 2011 it was listed on the Stock Exchange and was acquired by DW two years later. Its Greek head studied business administration at the University of Minster. He worked in Customer Service at Arvato and Deutsche Annington Immobilien, Bochum. And then in 2014 at Vonovia, where the launch came. She believes that climate change and an aging society will shape the housing market in the coming years: ‘The demand for living space is one thing, but we also have to look at how we can renovate that space energy-wise,’ she says. Although she is one of Germany’s most important technocratic personalities, Konstantina Kanellopoulou is projected strictly for her work alone. She is a recognizable face at the opening of a new project or through an interview about the apartment market in the country, a topic that “burns” Germans. Merilyn Paspaley – Paspaley Pearls, Pinctada Hotels & Resorts The Queen of Pearls 74-year-old Marilyn Paspaley started as an actress, but life led her into business. It makes sense, since her father Nicholas Paspalis, starting in the 1930s, managed to build an entire empire on the coast of Western Australia, arriving there from Castellorizo. An empire in the pearl market primarily, Paspaley Pearls, but it expanded into wine, aviation, real estate, and even the “Wall Street Hotel” in New York. At the multinational giant, the successor was Nicholas Paspaley Jr. and his sister Rosalyn Bracher. The second sister, Marilyn, after a career in television series, took the helm of the company. This may have happened without much effort, but it does nothing to diminish Marilyn’s status and successes as CEO of the company. In 2008 she was awarded the Order of Australia for her contribution to the marketing and promotion of Australian-designed pearls and jewellery. She has focused on the development of the hotel market-leading subsidiary Pinctada Hotels & Resorts in the world-class resort of Kimberley in north-western Australia, with a range of ultra-luxury resorts. However, on her frequent European trips she prefers luxury Swiss destinations such as St Moritz. Hari Sideris – Duke Energy The new leader Harry Sideris is the youngest to join the list of the world’s top Greek-born CEOs. The definition of an executive who has fought for three decades very hard, with diligence, consistency, and professionalism, climbing step by step up the ladder of a great energy company like Duke Energy. Raised in Asheville, North Carolina, by Greek immigrant parents, he studied chemical engineering and then charted an upward trajectory at the same company, reaching the presidency last year and, as of April 1 this year, will take over as CEO, succeeding Lynn Goode. The company whose helm the 53-year-old Sideris will keep is no accident. It’s listed on the NYSE, with 121 years of history behind it. Its headquarters are at the Duke Energy Plaza in Charlotte, North Carolina. Other than that it electrifies and supplies natural gas to Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Indiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, and Puerto Rico. It operates 11 nuclear power plants at six sites in North and South Carolina. With revenues of $29.06 billion in 2023, over 30,000 employees, and nearly 8 million customers, it was ranked as the 141st largest company in the US in 2024, steadily climbing up the rungs of the Fortune 500 list and aiming for the Top 100 this year. Harry Sideris lives in Charlotte with his wife Catherine and their two daughters, Marie and Zoe. Evangelia Wletta – Skyline Equities Realty He “built” Miami Evangelia Gouleta is a first-generation Greek-American businesswoman. Her company’s sales reach over $5 billion in many parts of the US, particularly in the greater Miami area. For a time she was also the “first lady” of New York City, between 1981-82, as the wife of then-state governor Hugh Carey, whom she divorced in 1989. Her parents were originally from Euboea and Santorini, while Guleta was born in Athens during the difficult years of the Occupation. Her family soon immigrated to Chicago where, when she was 17, her father bought a building with 6 apartments. She then gave him $700, which she had saved from jobs she did in the afternoons after school, as a down payment on one of the six apartments and paid the mortgage payment for the remaining amount each month. Today, the demonic Greek is president and CEO of Skyline Equities Realty, a company that acquires, builds, and develops luxury real estate in upscale areas. She has sold tens of thousands of properties and the name “Evangeline” is synonymous with prestigious addresses. Its portfolio includes “Buckingham Plaza” in Chicago, “Barclay Tower” in Denver, “Lafayette” shopping center, “Century of Progress” in Chicago, and “Skyline” on the famous Brickell Avenue, also known as “Millionaire’s Row” in Miami. Goleta is interested in Greece and is involved in many Greek-American organizations, including the Hellenic American Women’s Council (HAWC). In recognition of this quiet contribution, AHEPA Greece honored her at the first AHEPA Awards last December with the Greek American Personality Award for her promotion of Hellenism, dedication to family and personal development, and contributions to social and charitable causes. Jamie Dimon – JP Morgan Chase The most influential When Jamie Dimon speaks about the economy, the stock market, and geopolitical developments, everyone in the US listens intently. His opinion carries weight with the markets, investors, and governments of major countries. His predictions rarely miss. It was his brilliant moves that averted the collapse of Wall Street and the US financial system in the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis. A legacy that has enshrined him as by far the most influential manager, if not in the world, certainly in American finance. He has led, for the past 20 years, as chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, the leading US bank, and has repeatedly been included in Time magazine’s annual lists of the “100 most important people in the world”. One of the few managers who became billionaires by receiving staggering pay packages. For years the highest-paid CEO in the US, with an annual salary of $28 million. The 69-year-old third-generation Greek-American Dimon was born in New York to Greek immigrant children. But also bankers. Theodore’s father rose to executive vice president at American Express. Jamie studied psychology and economics at Tufts University and then at Harvard. It was there that he met his future wife Judith Kent. They married in 1983 and had three daughters. After a working stint in consulting firms, in March 2000 Dimon was appointed CEO of Bank One, then the 5th largest bank in the US. When JP Morgan Chase acquired it in July 2004, he became president and chief executive officer of the merged banks. A year later, on December 31, 2005, he became CEO of JPMC and then its chairman. An “unrepentant” banker, though the “sirens” to cross over into the political arena, even running for president, was constant, coming from both camps, Republican and Democrat. His relationship with Trump has gone through forty waves. Sometimes calm, sometimes cloudy. Same with Musk. In the campaign season (for party nominations) Trump, thinking he would support the Democrats, attempted to verbally disparage him. But quickly, when Dimon spoke sympathetically about his policies in 2017-20, he raised eyebrows. He even floated the idea of making him Treasury Secretary. He got no response. However, his key warning about the risk of stagflation in the US if the announcements of increased tariffs are implemented, the planetary leader seems to be ignoring it for now. Dimon does not forget his Greek roots. He is interested in the Greek economy, pushes investments to our country, both JP Morgan and others, and meets frequently with the current Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Albert Bourla – Pfizer The businessman of the pandemic One of the most talked-about faces of the last five years, 64-year-old Albert Bourla, as the pharmaceutical company he heads, Pfizer, was the first, in partnership with BioNTech, to manufacture and distribute billions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Born in Thessaloniki, of Jewish descent, he studied at Aristotle University and obtained a PhD in Biotechnology of Reproduction at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. A professorship at AUTH awaited him, but he was beaten to it by the tempting offer from Pfizer to join its staff. He set off for Athens, but after two years the journey continued to four different countries. In January 2018 he became general manager of operations, in October CEO, and in January 2020 he became executive chairman of the pharmaceutical giant. His international accolades and awards are innumerable. With his name synonymous with the battle against coronavirus, CNN chose him as Businessman of the Year, where he beat out Ilon Musk. Of all the Greek-born CEOs who excel internationally, Bourla is the best known, but also the most… Greek. He lives permanently in New York, but has a home in Halkidiki where he comes for summer vacations with his wife and their two children. Bourla has given a huge boost to Pfizer’s investment in Greece, signalling for other US giants to follow. In October 2021, Pfizer’s Global Digital Innovation Center and Global Operations and Services Center opened in Thessaloniki, creating hundreds of new jobs. Hundreds of hundreds of jobs have been created and hundreds of employees have been employed. Although under his tenure Pfizer’s profits soared, nevertheless a new minority shareholder, the Starboard Value fund, accused him months ago of bad choices that damaged the company and demanded an explanation. However, the operation to reinstate Burla failed. The major shareholders (Vanguard Group, BlackRock, etc.) of the giant fully supported the Greek CEO. Despite this, he remained among the 100 most powerful people in business, according to Fortune, and the most influential in health care, according to Time. While last April he received the American Association for Cancer Research’s Outstanding Achievement Award in San Diego, California. Ted Sarantos – Netflix From the video stores… Third-generation immigrant, Netflix strongman Ted Sarantos, was born in New Jersey and raised in Phoenix, Arizona. His grandfather had emigrated from Samos to the US, also changing his last name from Karyotakis to Sarantos. He gave up his studies in journalism at the University of Arizona to run the video store he worked at when he was in high school. He soon managed to run 8 stores until he became an executive at one of the largest videotape distribution companies in the US, East Texas. By March 2000, Sarantos was vice president of Products and Merchandise for the nearly 500-store chain. His next career move was to join Netflix, which had nothing to do with today’s global streaming giant but was simply a mail-order movie distribution company. Having met then CEO Reed Hastings in March 2000, he took over as Head of Programming and his choices proved to be the key man in its evolution into the powerful conglomerate it is today. The rest is a deafening success story. As of summer 2020, Sarantos was upgraded to co-CEO. He and his first wife Michelle had two children, film producer Sarah Sarandos and film editor Anthony Sarandos. In 2009 he married former US Ambassador to the Bahamas Nicole Avant, daughter of former Motown chairman Clarence Avant. They now live in Hancock Park, Los Angeles. A staunch Democratic supporter and interlocutor of former President Barack Obama. He frequently visits Greece for business and vacations. In July 2022, he even became the recipient of Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s desire to have a successful Greek-language series on Netflix, during a discussion at the Herodesion at an Endeavor Greece event. Among other things, the two men discussed the prospects of Greece becoming a country for film and series production. Michelle Dukeris – AB InBev The King of Beer Greek-Brazilian, eminent technocrat, currently based in Belgium and the city of Leuven, “King of Beer”. This is briefly the profile of 52-year-old Michel Dukkeris who respects and honours his motherland, namely Greece. And he often declares himself proud of his Greek roots. From July 2021 he will lead the management of the world’s largest brewery, AB InBev, with over 150,000 employees in 24 countries. Born in Lagos, Brazil, the son of a first-generation Greek immigrant, a chemical engineering graduate from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, and with a rich post-graduate background in management in the US, he joined AB InBev in 1996. He worked first in Latin America and then as the company’s head of China and Asia-Pacific for seven years. The first achievement was a 400% jump in corporate revenue. He was promoted to head of global sales and then CEO of North America, where he took the company from loss to profit. All this led him to the top of the hierarchy of the giant that has 400 brands under its umbrella, including Budweiser, Corona, Stella Artois, Beck’s, Leffe,and others. An earlier Financial Times feature on Dukkeris said he was fascinated by China’s five-year growth programs and adopted their philosophy in his business strategy. He operated the company based on a ten-year growth plan, always aiming to stay ahead of its competitors. From the result, he was vindicated. Among his major successes, he drastically cut costs to reduce the company’s debts, which when he took over the helm amounted to $80 billion. “Every dollar counts,” he says, asking every regional manager to justify every single expense, even the paper for the printer. The severe cost-cutting has saved thousands of positions for the company’s staff. It also credits the implementation of AB InBev’s first e-commerce platform, where it also increased sales.

Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said in an interview with Financial Times (FT) that he will present a bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank diversify 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves into the leading cryptocurrency by market value. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good," Michl said, according to an interview published by the FT and quoted by Reuters. Michl pointed to broader investor interest in the cryptocurrency since BlackRock and others debuted spot ETFs a year ago. "An asset under consideration is Bitcoin. It currently has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. Worth considering. Right now, it’s only at the stage of analysis and discussion. The Bank Board decides, and no decision is imminent. Thoughtful analysis is needed," Michl said in a statement on X. "Bitcoin has significant volatility, which makes it harder to take advantage of its current low correlation with other assets. That’s why I will ask our team on Thursday to further assess Bitcoin’s potential role in our reserves. Nothing more, nothing less," he added.

Title: Who to watch in Ireland's U20 Six Nations campaign
URL: https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/czxkvkxznkro
Time Published: 2025-01-29T07:09:25Z
Full Content:
Eanna McCarthy, Michael Foy, Henry Walker and Ciaran Mangan at Ireland Men's U20s squad announcement Ireland will aim to banish the heartbreak of missing out on a third successive Grand Slam in this year's Under-20 Six Nations. Neil Doak has named a 31-man squad after being appointed head coach in December, with England - the team who denied them a third straight clean sweep last year - first up on 30 January. There has been a proven pathway in recent years from age-grade level to the senior side. Look no further than Sam Prendergast, a player who won a Grand Slam with the under-20s in 2023 and now finds himself fighting for Ireland's 10 jersey in this year's Six Nations. As we look ahead to this year's tournament, BBC Sport NI picks five players who might catch the eye for Ireland's youngsters. Eanna McCarthy will captain Ireland at this year's U20's Six Nations Championship Province: Connacht Club: Galwegians Age: 19 Position: Back row While he may be a new face in the side, and donning the title of captain, Eanna McCarthy is no stranger to responsibility. Before heading to the west coast over the summer to join the Connacht academy, Cork native McCarthy captained the Munster Under-19s through their 2024 campaign, defeating both Ulster and Connacht. At club level, McCarthy has been a regular name on the team sheet for Galwegians RFC, who play in the All-Ireland League [AIL] Division 2B. Alongside his leadership qualities, McCarthy is praised for his work rate on and off the ball, bringing physicality in his attack and defence, something which Doak will look to utilise throughout the campaign. Alex Usanov played for Emerging Ireland in October's tour of South Africa Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Prop Alex Usanov is one of the six members in the current squad who returns to the fold for a second consecutive year, and it is fair to say he's been busy since then. A player credited for his physicality and power in the scrum, the Leinster academy prop was included in the Emerging Ireland squad in October, gaining valuable minutes and experience along the way against three tough South African sides. For the past two seasons, Usanov's had huge involvement at AIL Division 1A side Clontarf, and his contribution's have been crucial in the sides challenge for top spot. They currently sit two points behind league leaders St. Mary's College. Some years before his rise in Irish Rugby, Usanov was a successful martial arts competitor. He became All-Ireland champion for Judo in 2018 and 2019, a sport which he believes taught him different disciplines. Hooker Henry Walker returns for a second year hoping to claim an U20 Six Nations medal Province: Ulster Club: Queen's University Age: 19 Position: Hooker Another returning face to the side is hooker Henry Walker. Just like his front row partner Usanov, Walker was involved in last year's Championship, and was unlucky to miss out on selection for the Junior World Cup last summer due to injury. The former Hartpury College player has progressed into year two of the Academy at Ulster and has impressed in appearances for his local side QUB who find themselves seventh in AIL Division 1B. A dynamic hooker who plays a physical game with or without the ball, he too shows the qualities of a leader having captained the under-20s to a win in a friendly against Italy in December. He will no doubt look to push Ireland all the way this time after narrowly missing out last year. Leinster academy centre Connor Fahy splits the Italian defence in a friendly Province: Leinster Club: Clontarf Age: 19 Position: Centre A product of his local team Wexford Wanderers, Connor Fahy is certainly an exciting prospect. Playing for club side Clontarf in AIL Division 1A, Fahy provides a powerful outlet at Doak's disposal in the centre of the pitch. As another graduate of the Leinster academy, Fahy featured in the IRFU 150th 'A' Interprovincial Championship last November against Munster 'A'. Versatility is a key component to his game, with the capability to cover inside and outside centre. As physical player who promises to cross the gainline, there is no doubt he can create a problem for defenders. Ciaran Mangan faced his brother in a pre-tournament friendly December Province: Leinster Club: Blackrock College Age: 19 Position: Centre A versatile back who can cover centre and both wings, Ciaran Mangan is expected to cause plenty of problems for any opposition. Credited for his electric pace on the ball, accompanied with a strong work ethic, Mangan has also found himself in the centre of the park for AIL Division 1B side Blackrock College. This type of flexibility might be of use to Doak, who may look to deploy a player of Mangan's quality across the backline, rather than tying him to one position. Another product of the Leinster Academy, Ciaran faced his older brother Diarmuid in a final warm-up game against Leinster 'A' ahead of Doak's squad announcement. Diarmuid, who has featured for the Leinster senior team over the past two seasons, was involved with the under-20s side who won back to back Grand Slams in 2022 and 2023.

(Reuters) - Czech National Bank Governor Ales Michl said that he will present a plan to the central bank's board to invest in bitcoin and added that it was "very likely" the bank would cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week, according to an interview published by the Financial Times on Wednesday. Michl said he will present the plan to the board on Thursday, and if approved, the bank could eventually hold as much as 5% of its 140 billion euro ($146.13 billion) reserves in bitcoin, according to the FT. "For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” he said. He added that bitcoin would trend higher even without the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump since it's an alternative investment for many people. Bitcoin hit a record high earlier this month when Trump, who has pledged to be a "crypto president," was sworn in. It has more than doubled in value in 2024, driven by the U.S. market regulator's approval for exchange-traded funds tied to its spot price, and optimism over easing regulatory hurdles under Trump. Michl, too, highlighted wider investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other firms last year launched bitcoin exchange traded funds, according to the FT.

Title: Continuity Sinn Féin the order of the day as Mary Lou McDonald sticks with her tried and trusted

The great purge of Parnell Square turned out to be a weak Milk of Magnesia effort in the end. In an interview before Christmas, Mary Lou McDonald promised a “significant reshuffle” at parliamentary party level come the new year. “Nobody is in a position indefinitely,” declared the woman who became leader of Sinn Féin once Gerry Adams decided to step down after 34 years in charge. Certainly, her party has never been found wanting over the years when justifying why nobody is indispensable. So news she was about to announce her new front bench prompted much speculation about blood on the carpet in Kevin Barry Memorial Hall. That struggle never materialised. Reports of a big clear-out of familiar faces were greatly exaggerated. It seems Mary Lou was gilding the Easter Lily when she made her Yuletide prediction. The new front bench is remarkably like the old one. Having feasted on the red meat of Dáil Éireann in tumult last week, political reporters had been hoping she could keep the carnage going with this “significant” switcheroo. But all she delivered was a minor tweaking of the usual cast of characters. Longford-Westmeath’s Sorca Clarke was the only one dropped while two first-time deputies – Donna McGettigan (Clare) and Joanna Byrne (Louth) – joined the team. Consolation may come soon for erstwhile frontbencher Sorca. “When the Government appoints junior spokespersons we will follow suit,” said her leader during Tuesday’s disappointing unveiling in the Alex Hotel near Leinster House. The list of new Minister of State is out on Wednesday. This should bring some relief to a nation battling to cope with the aftermath of Storm Éowyn while simultaneously fretting over who will get what consolation prize for missing out on a seat at the Cabinet table. Or maybe not. Because, let’s face it, nobody is that bothered. So back to Mary Lou and her still in situ stalwarts, who found themselves in this hotel meeting room at the last minute because rain forced them to abandon plans to hold the event outside on the Leinster House plinth. But in a nice twist, the four-star Alex is situated on Fenian Street. So they felt very much at home. Not to be outdone by the Shinners, the new Coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Michael Lowry’s leg is now frantically searching for a venue on Tribunal Street, Balls-up Boulevard or Audacity Avenue to host its ceremonial roll-out of the Juniors. On Fenian Street, there was wasn’t enough time to set out tables for display purposes so the new old front bench stood in two lines in the middle of the parquet floor behind Mary Lou. There was more than enough space for everyone to launch into an impromptu Walls of Limerick. Instead, the party leader took to a small lectern and made a “simple pledge to the working people of Ireland”. An evocative reminder of the working people stood at the end of the first line. For it was Eoin Ó Broin, the party’s Blackrock College educated spokesman on housing, poignantly wearing the honest workwear of the toiling Irish navvy from the last century – a black donkey-jacket with distinctive leatherette patches on each shoulder. [ The Michael Lowry issue is still unresolved and may escalate. GUBU’s the word for itOpens in new window ] English comedians of old used to joke about Paddy being asked the meaning of the word “fascinate”. And Paddy would say “Oi, I have 10 buttons on me donkey-jacket but I can only fasten eight”. Mary Lou’s simple pledge to the working people was to guarantee that Sinn Féin “will be up and at it from day one, working for you, non-stop”. As for Eoin, the toil never stops either. He kept his portfolio in the mini-shuffle as did high-profile performers Pearse O’Doherty (finance), David Cullinane (health), Mairéad O’Farrell (public expenditure and reform) and Claire Kerrane (children, disability and equality). Sinn Féin’s top team may have hit the ground running, but Mary Lou called out the Government for going straight into a two-week recess as soon as it was reinstalled after the long break for Christmas and the general election. Why do they need extra-time to familiarise themselves with the job? “They have no excuse now: they’ve been in Government forever. At least it feels like forever.” But never mind. Sinn Féin will get straight down to business when they “come back off their holibops”. In the meantime, the row over the Regional Independent group and its controversial Stroke Whisperer demanding Opposition speaking time rumbles on. “Michael Lowry simply will not be allowed to masquerade as an Opposition TD,” said the Sinn Féin leader, stressing that the combined Opposition remains firmly united on this issue. And speaking of working together, what does she make of the call from Labour’s Ivana Bacik for parties on the left to consider nominating an agreed candidate to contest the presidential election later this year? “It would make sense to have a joint approach, if that’s possible,” said Mary Lou. But the party has yet to discuss finding a successor to Michael D Higgins. “Who ever gets elected will have big shoes to fill.” Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Elon Musk, head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is exploring the use of blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures, aiming to enhance transparency, secure data, streamline payments and build management. This initiative aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability, building on proposals like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 idea to put the entire federal budget on a blockchain for public scrutiny. DOGE officially launched on Jan. 21, with the goal of modernizing federal technology and software. The department, created by an executive order from President Trump, is tasked with identifying spending cuts and delivering recommendations by July 4, 2026. While blockchain offers potential benefits, experts warn of the complexities and challenges in applying it to a large, complex entity like the U.S. government. Issues include loss of control with public blockchains and the sufficiency of conventional databases for similar tasks. Despite concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain for specific purposes, such as the California DMV and BlackRock. If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste.

Despite concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain for specific purposes, such as the California DMV and BlackRock. If DOGE proceeds, it would be the largest government blockchain project in U.S. history, reflecting the administration's commitment to using advanced technology to tackle inefficiency and waste. In a bold move to modernize federal operations and curb wasteful spending, Elon Musk, head of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is reportedly exploring using blockchain technology to track and manage U.S. government expenditures. According to sources familiar with the discussions, the initiative aims to enhance transparency, secure sensitive data, streamline payments and build management. This effort aligns with Musk's mission to eliminate trillions of dollars from the federal budget and ensure accountability in government operations. The discussions, which have included consultations with representatives from public blockchain networks, mark a significant step in the Trump administration's push to integrate digital assets into federal systems. While the initiative is still in its early stages, it has already sparked debate about the feasibility and necessity of using blockchain for such large-scale government projects. The idea of leveraging blockchain technology to increase government transparency is not new. In April 2024, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. proposed putting the entire federal budget on a blockchain, allowing citizens to scrutinize every expenditure in real-time. "Every American can look at every budget item in the entire budget, anytime they want, 24 hours a day," Kennedy told a rally in Michigan. "We are going to have 300 million eyeballs on our budget. If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody will know about it." Kennedy's proposal resonated with small-government advocates and fiscal conservatives, who have long criticized the federal government's unchecked spending. Musk's initiative appears to build on this momentum, with the DOGE exploring how blockchain could be used not only to track spending but also to secure data, facilitate payments and manage federal infrastructure. DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement. However, the department's mission extends far beyond memes and cryptocurrencies. Created by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, DOGE is tasked with modernizing federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity. The department is expected to work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget to identify spending cuts and deliver recommendations by July 4, 2026. Musk has already enlisted about 100 volunteers to write code for his projects, signaling his commitment to rapid implementation. The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history. The effort underscores the Trump administration's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to address longstanding issues of inefficiency and waste. (Related: Bitcoin's bull run may extend into 2025, but regulatory shifts and market indicators suggest caution.) However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Previous attempts by large corporations to implement blockchain solutions have often stalled due to governance issues and the discovery that existing database technologies are often more cost-effective. As Hammond noted, "The question is whether you really need a blockchain to do that, since conventional databases can be used in a similar way and with fewer downsides."

"We are going to have 300 million eyeballs on our budget. If somebody is spending $16,000 for a toilet seat, everybody will know about it." Kennedy's proposal resonated with small-government advocates and fiscal conservatives, who have long criticized the federal government's unchecked spending. Musk's initiative appears to build on this momentum, with the DOGE exploring how blockchain could be used not only to track spending but also to secure data, facilitate payments and manage federal infrastructure. DOGE takes its first steps The DOGE officially launched its website on Jan. 21, adopting the logo of Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that inspired its name. The move caused a brief surge in Dogecoin's price, which rose approximately 11 percent to $0.38 following the announcement. However, the department's mission extends far beyond memes and cryptocurrencies. Created by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, DOGE is tasked with modernizing federal technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity. The department is expected to work closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget to identify spending cuts and deliver recommendations by July 4, 2026. Musk has already enlisted about 100 volunteers to write code for his projects, signaling his commitment to rapid implementation. The blockchain initiative is one of several technological tools being considered to reduce costs, eliminate fraud and address the ballooning federal deficit â a key issue Trump campaigned on in 2024. While the potential benefits of blockchain technology are clear, experts caution that applying it to an entity as vast and complex as the U.S. government is uncharted territory. Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history.

Sam Hammond, chief economist at the Foundation for American Innovation, noted that "an internal government blockchain could be used to track spending, documents and contracts in a way that's fully secure and transparent." However, he questioned whether blockchain is necessary for such tasks, given that conventional databases can achieve similar results with fewer complications. Public blockchains, like those used by Bitcoin and Solana, present additional challenges. Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, pointed out that "one issue with the government using a public blockchain is that they would have no control over the entries. I think that loss of control would be a problem for governments." Despite these concerns, some institutions have successfully implemented blockchain technology for specific purposes. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has digitized millions of car titles on the Avalanche blockchain and BlackRock has issued a money-market fund on several cryptocurrency ledgers. If DOGE moves forward with its blockchain initiative, it would represent the largest government project of its kind in U.S. history. The effort underscores the Trump administration's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to address longstanding issues of inefficiency and waste. (Related: Bitcoin's bull run may extend into 2025, but regulatory shifts and market indicators suggest caution.) However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. Previous attempts by large corporations to implement blockchain solutions have often stalled due to governance issues and the discovery that existing database technologies are often more cost-effective. As Hammond noted, "The question is whether you really need a blockchain to do that, since conventional databases can be used in a similar way and with fewer downsides."

Title: JOHN STOSSEL: Woke ESG Culture Going Down In Flames During Trump Era

“Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential climate envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism — producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

Title: Ondo to Bring Tokenized US Treasurys to XRPL
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/ondo-to-bring-tokenized-us-treasurys-to-xrpl/

Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasurys to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, the companies said in a Tuesday (Jan. 28) press release. “This integration is the natural convergence of a compliance-first, yield-bearing product with a network purpose-built for institutional adoption, setting the groundwork for forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain,” Ondo Finance Vice President of Partnerships Katie Wheeler said in the release. Ondo and Ripple have secured commitments to seed OUSG liquidity upon deployment, according to the release. The companies’ collaboration will meet institutional demand for tokenized U.S. Treasurys that offer liquidity, efficiency and transparency in capital markets, the release said. Bringing OUSG to XRPL will provide a solution that provides institutional-grade security, accessible liquidity, and seamless tokenization and trading of real-world assets (RWAs), per the release. “The 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG marks a transformative shift in capital flow management, breaking free from traditional trading hours and slow settlements,” Markus Infanger, senior vice president, RippleX, said in the release. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. Ripple and Archax extended their existing collaboration in June, saying they aimed to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized RWAs onto XRPL. Because Archax works with financial institutions to enable them to tokenize their financial RWAs, the collaboration will allow those institutions to select the XRPL to do so. In February, Ondo Finance and Aptos Foundation partnered on the integration of RWAs with blockchain technology, beginning with the integration of Ondo’s tokenized U.S. Treasurys product, USDY, onto the Aptos blockchain. The partnership also sets the stage for a series of financial products using the strengths of the two organizations. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
