We recently published a list of 15 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing. The regulator has initiated an inquiry into the licensing framework for satellite-internet providers to provide clear rules for potential operators in the country. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In Japan, multinational conglomerate Softbank has partnered with chipmaker NVIDIA in a partnership that aims to turn communication base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets. The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services. Softbank estimates a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.

Market Capitalization: $3.6 Trillion NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Latest reports published by DigiTimes Asia contend that the NVIDIA RTX 50 series display cards, also known famously as Blackwell, are set to launch and suppliers are optimistic about the market impact of these cards. The report claims that Auras Technology, a Taiwan-based cooling components supplier for the chipmaker, has predicted that the latest GPUs may seize the whole market starting in December. Auras Technology expects demand for its cooling products to grow across the PC, GPU, and server markets next year. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of AI news and ratings you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: D&D: ‘Monster Manual’ Previews Hidden In The Free Adventures

Trending Topics Follow BoLS Explore our other sites It won’t be out for a few months yet, but these Monster Manual previews, scattered in some of the new adventures, foretell things to come. The new 5.5E Monster Manual won’t be out for a few months yet. February is, at press time, not yet right around the corner. Which is a relief, because I’m finally getting the hang of September. But though time stands between you and the completion of the 5.5E core rulebook set (first printing), you can still catch a glimpse of what lies in store. Monster Manual previews are scattered throughout the books and adventures released so far. Scions of Elemental Evil, Uni and the Hunt for the Lost Horn, and the adventures included in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, as well as stat blocks in the Player’s Handbook, all point to what the new Monster Manual will be like. Here are a few things we’ve learned. First things first, Monsters in 5.5E look a lot like they did in 5E. The wheel hasn’t been reinvented; it’s just had its numbers crunched a bit more. At least, that’s what they say. I haven’t actually done a number crunch myself. Every time I think of the phrase “number crunch,” my brain just sort of short circuits to WoW Guild Pals For Life’s seminal video about a man who returns from being AFK to grab some chicken, which came out 19 years ago now. But we’re not here to see what happens when Blackrock Whelps overwhelm a party. We’re here to talk about the Monster Manual previews sprinkled throughout the adventures. One of the first lessons we learn is all about mages and other magic-using enemies. And that is the return and evolution of the “magic attack” from Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse. In Hunt for the Lost Horn, we see the Mage, a new CR 6 NPC that could potentially be an enemy or ally NPC spellcaster. It follows a familiar format. A unique “magic attack,” in this case an Arcane Burst, which is a ranged or melee spell attack that does 3d10 damage and can be made three at a time thanks to its multiattack feature. The mage also has a handful of spells, including Fireball and Cone of Cold. Another quick lesson we learn from the same adventure is that some previous things like Pack Tactics seem to have been folded into the attacks themselves. It’s like weapon mastery properties but for monsters. Take the Worg from the same adventure. It has a Bite Attack. But an innate part of the bite attack is that the next attack roll made against a target bitten by a Worg has advantage. It’s no longer a separate trait DMs are likely to forget. It’s a subtle change, but one I think makes Monsters a bit more dynamic and interesting. Another thing we see is a lot more monsters with ranged attacks. The Bugbear Warrior, featured in Scions of Elemental Evil comes with a Light Hammer. Ignore for now that Light Hammer is an awful name for a weapon. Because while it’s a bad name, the hammer can be thrown or used in a grapple. Sometimes, though, your enemies will roll up armed with a brace of pistols. Take the Pirate Captain out of Scions of Elemental Evil. They can just shoot you with a pistol as much as they like (up to three times per round). Each shot does 2d10 + 4 damage on a hit. They get to ignore the Loading property of a pistol. But if that bothers you as a DM, don’t worry. You can just say it’s a brace of pistols and determine when they run out. D&D being the way it is, they’ll be dead before they can make more than a handful of attacks. But this is a trend we see a lot of: monsters with multiple attacks and multiple modes of attack. I think monsters may feel a little more dynamic overall. The DM may have more options for monsters to use to adapt to the unfurling situation of combat. Look for the Monster Manual in February 2025!

That’s what the hedge fund legend said in an interview last month, and it's part of why he's long been an outspoken Bitcoin bull. And Tudor Jones walks the walk, too: His hedge fund has massively upped its exposure to “digital gold” via the largest Bitcoin ETF in the United States. A new 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week shows that Tudor Investment Corporation held over 4.4 million shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF), as of September 30. That stash was worth about $160 million at the time, but is now valued at $230 million at the current price. Back in June, the hedge fund held just 869,565 shares of the ETF, which trades under the ticker IBIT. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now allows more traditional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin via its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. An ETF is a popular investment vehicle allowing people to buy shares that track an underlying asset—which could be anything from foreign currency and gold to U.S. equities or copper. The SEC in January approved Bitcoin ETFs, allowing them to trade on stock exchanges and opening the doors to a new class of crypto investors. BlackRock’s ETF has received the biggest inflows and day-to-day trading action. Jones, who has spoken about Bitcoin for years, earlier this month said that he thought the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was a good bet because of increasing U.S. federal debt. He added that gold and commodities were also what he’s favored for his portfolio as of late. “I think all roads lead to inflation,” he said in a CNBC interview. “I’m long gold, I’m long Bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously underowned—so I’m long commodities.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: CSO’s launches new housing portal

Full Content:
Home completions have jumped nearly five-fold in a decade, Glenageary in south Dublin has the highest average monthly rent in the State while the average price paid for a property in Dublin is now over €600,000. These are just of some housing data points contained the Central Statistics Office’s (CSO) new housing hub, described by the agency as a “one-stop shop” for key information about the sector. “The purpose of this new housing hub is to collate statistics on housing in Ireland from the CSO and other public sector organisations in one easy to find location,” the agency said. It comes as housing emerges as the main political issue in the general election campaign with parties presenting different policies for dealing with the crisis. The CSO denied the launch had anything to do with the election though, noting the hub “has been in development for months and has been on our online release calendar since mid-September”. The CSO said its new resource provided a range of information, broken down into four main themes: home building; home prices and rents; cost of building homes; and housing features. It showed the top 10 highest average monthly rents were all located in Dublin, with Glenageary being the highest at €2,808 followed by Sandymount (€2,654), Dalkey (€2,651), Booterstown (€2,549), Ballsbridge (€2,523), Sandycove (€2,506), Clonskeagh (€2,497), Pembroke (€2,482), Blackrock (€2,455) and Killiney (€2,439). The most expensive area outside Dublin was Greystones, Wicklow (€2,155) followed by Bishoptown, Cork (€1,912) and Castletroy, Limerick (€1,849). The hub also indicated that the average or mean price paid for a home nationally in the 12 months to August this year was €419,893 while the average in Dublin was €613,492. The figures also show that in 2022 the population grew by 8 per cent while the State’s housing stock grew by 5 per cent. They also show that new dwelling completions rose from just 6,994 in 2011 to a post-crash high of 32,548 last year.

Title: 'I'm One Of You' – How 'Anti-Woke' Warrior Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire At Only 38

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Vivek Ramaswamy is a name making waves. Whether it's his stance against corporate "wokeness" or his ambitious political moves, people have started paying attention to him. But behind all the headlines, Ramaswamy has an intriguing story: a child of Indian immigrants who turned his biotech gamble into a billion-dollar fortune – all by age 38. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett Flipped His Neighbor's $67,000 Life Savings Into A $50 Million Fortune — This Would Be Worth Over $500 Million Today Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Born to Indian immigrant parents, Vivek Ramaswamy grew up with a strong work ethic. Forbes reports his dad worked as an engineer and patent attorney while his mom was a psychiatrist. He didn't coast by in school – Ramaswamy graduated from Harvard with a biology degree and cofounded a startup that helped student founders pitch business ideas to investors. It wasn't a big moneymaker but gave him a taste of entrepreneurship. After Harvard, Ramaswamy worked at QVT, a hedge fund specializing in pharmaceutical investments. By 28, he had become a partner, earning about $7 million. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. At 29, Ramaswamy took a big swing. He left his hedge fund job to found Roivant Sciences (NASDAQ:ROIV), an investment company focused on rescuing abandoned drugs. His bet? That some forgotten treatments could still be worth billions. He was right. Just a year after founding Roivant, one of its subsidiaries, Axovant, went public with a valuation of $2.2 billion. Ramaswamy had bought the Alzheimer's drug that Axovant was based on for only $5 million. While that drug ultimately didn't work out, it didn't stop Ramaswamy from scoring big elsewhere. However, as Forbes writes, in 2020, a Japanese pharmaceutical company bought several of Roivant’s drugs for $3 billion. That sale alone made Ramaswamy an instant multimillionaire. By then, he'd pulled in about $260 million in salary, bonuses and capital gains from Roivant. He invested his gains wisely, mostly in stocks and bonds and riskier bets like Bitcoin, ethereum and Rumble, a YouTube competitor. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share In 2021, Ramaswamy decided to switch gears. He stepped down as CEO of Roivant and focused on politics. He wrote a book called Woke, Inc., where he tore into corporate America’s focus on social justice and the environment. He argued that big companies forgot about making quality products and focused too much on "good PR." The book turned heads and put Ramaswamy on the map as a vocal critic of what he called "woke capitalism." Not long after, he launched Strive Asset Management, an "anti-woke" version of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), one of the largest asset managers in the world. Ramaswamy's firm encouraged businesses to focus on profits, not politics. Investors seemed to like it; Strive was recently valued at about $300 million. Heavy hitters like Peter Thiel, Bill Ackman and Joe Lonsdale even backed it, helping Ramaswamy grow his wealth further. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Ramaswamy has tried to position himself as a regular guy, unlike other wealthy figures. He's got two homes in Ohio worth $2.5 million combined, which may sound like a lot, but it’s far less than many other political figures. He insists that his lifestyle is modest compared to other rich people, though he does admit to owning stakes in three private jets. "If we could buy time, we would buy time. And that's the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family," he says. See Also: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you. During a campaign stop in New Hampshire, a woman thanked him, a billionaire, for visiting the "cow-town people." Ramaswamy smiled and said, "I'm one of you." He's not, of course – and that might be part of the appeal. People see someone who took big risks, succeeded and isn't apologizing for his wealth. Now, Ramaswamy is stepping even deeper into public life. Recently, President-elect Donald Trump appointed him and Elon Musk as coheads of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new initiative to cut government waste and slash regulations.

Title: Is Illumina, Inc. (ILMN) the Best Immunotherapy Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Immunotherapy Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) stands against the other immunotherapy stocks. The global immunotherapy drugs market is rapidly expanding, with projections to grow from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2033. The growth is driven by the global rise in chronic diseases such as different types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Cancer, particularly is becoming more prevalent among people globally. The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, which highlights the increasing burden of cancer worldwide. In 2022 alone, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease. By 2050, annual cancer cases are expected to reach 35 million, driving demand for innovative treatments like immunotherapy. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to traditional therapies, and its applications are expanding as research advances. It can be applied to various types of cancer, either alone or alongside treatments like chemotherapy. Immunomodulating agents, a type of non-specific immunotherapy, help improve the body’s immune system's capability of detecting and attacking cancer cells. Read Also: 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20 and 10 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now. Due to the growing demand for treatments, leading pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in research and development to expand the range of immunotherapy drugs available. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. Combining different therapies and tailoring treatments to individual patients is helping to unlock new applications for immunotherapy, positioning it to revolutionize cancer care and other areas of medicine. North America led the global immunotherapy drugs industry in 2023, capturing over 48.19% of total revenue, driven by medical advancements and regulatory approvals, particularly in the US. The FDA's approval of immunotherapy for cancers with specific genetic traits, regardless of origin, highlights the region's leadership in innovative treatments like tumor-agnostic therapies. With over 2 million new cancer cases expected in the US in 2024, demand for effective treatments like immunotherapy will continue to grow. Organizations such as Canada’s National Research Council are also developing new immunotherapies, aiming to provide hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers like B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We selected stocks from ETFs with immunotherapy exposure and narrowed down the list to the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The hedge fund sentiment has been sourced from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A research facility with medical professionals surrounded by diagnostic equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a leading genomics company that provides advanced tools for analyzing DNA and RNA. Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) plays a key role in advancing immunotherapy research, particularly through its next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. These tools help scientists study the mechanisms by which tumors evade the immune system and identify therapeutic targets that could boost immune responses against cancer. Wall Street analysts and investors are optimistic about Illumina, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:ILMN) future, especially after the Grail spin-off in 2024 and the acquisition of Fluent Biosciences to improve its single-cell analysis and multiomics capabilities. In Q2, Illumina exceeded expectations, achieving Core Illumina revenue of $1.1 billion and operating margins of 22.2%, supported by steady progress on its strategic goals. The stock has received a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy.” Here’s what Patient Capital Management said about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) is a good example. We entered the name late last year as the company began to trade at a 5-yr low. The company is a leader in the genomic sequencing space but made an ill-advised acquisition of Grail, a blood-based multi-cancer early detection product, in 2021 for $8B dollars. Grail was an annual ~$600m drag on profitability hitting the financials at the same time that competition began to pick up and the overall demand environment began to weaken. Despite increased competition in the genome sequencing space, Illumina continues to be a leader with ~80% market share today. With the successful separation of Grail Inc. (GRAL) in June, Illumina has now returned to a pure-play sequencing company. As the company returns to historical profitability post Grail spin-off and as the demand environment normalizes post COVID, we believe you can buy a market leader in a secularly growing industry for less than a market multiple.” Overall ILMN ranks 5th on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ILMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ILMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: There are 'no natural sellers' in stocks: BlackRock's Rick Rieder

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. “There are no natural sellers,” Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He’s the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. “I think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.” Second, “The technicals are crazy for equities,” Rieder said. That’s in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. "Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations," he said. "We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years." Of course, that’s not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited “animal spirits” in the market. “I think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,” Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed, and in addition to that, a lot of deregulation. So we're upping our estimates for what profit margins are going to be doing over the next couple of years.” Rieder and Stoltzfus agree that a far-off potential risk for stocks and the economy more broadly could be the ballooning of the US deficit and debt, and a possible resultant buyers' strike in the Treasury market that could send yields higher. However, markets aren’t concerned at the moment. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rieder said. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026 unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and, then obviously, inflation relative to that.” Last week showed euphoria was dampened but perhaps not eliminated. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, falling 2.1%. That also means it closed 2.1% below its record high of 6,001.35, a level that could be quickly surpassed if the “animal spirits” that Yardeni invoked reassert themselves.

Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have surged to become some of the fastest-growing ETFs of all-time following their January debut and led by BlackRock's $42 billion bitcoin fund, could be about to be approved for options trading after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an advisory notice. "[I]n light of relevant precedents in the courts, it is substantially likely these spot commodity ETF shares would be held to be securities," a CFTC spokesperson wrote. "Therefore, [the Division of Clearing and Risk's] DCR position is the listing of these shares on [Security and Exchange Commission] SEC-registered national securities exchanges does not implicate the CFTC’s jurisdiction, and therefore, the clearing of these options by OCC would be undertaken in its capacity as a registered clearing agency subject to SEC oversight." Bitcoin spot ETF options were given the green light by the U.S. SEC in September when BlackRock's proposal to list and trade options for its IBIT fund was approved, with the CFTC notice the "second hurdle they needed to clear," according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. Options trading for the fleet of a dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs is expected to "attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish" to the market as institutions and market regulators warm up to the technology.

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, a so-called innovation and disruption investor who runs the Ark Invest fund, has reiterated her $1.5 million bitcoin price prediction—which she expects will make bitcoin a $30 trillion asset by 2030. "We have a 2030 target, in our base case it’s around $650,000, in our bull case, it’s between $1 million and $1.5 million," Wood told CNBC, adding "regulatory relief" in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory and increased interest from Wall Street will fuel a bitcoin price boom. "It is a new asset class and what that means is institutions, and asset allocators are saying 'this asset is behaving differently from all our other assets and we need to include it,'" Wood said.

Title: Is Immunocore Holdings plc (IMCR) the Best Immunotherapy Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Immunotherapy Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Immunocore Holdings plc (NASDAQ:IMCR) stands against the other immunotherapy stocks. The global immunotherapy drugs market is rapidly expanding, with projections to grow from $240 billion in 2023 to $1.3 trillion by 2033. The growth is driven by the global rise in chronic diseases such as different types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Cancer, particularly is becoming more prevalent among people globally. The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 Global Cancer Statistics report, which highlights the increasing burden of cancer worldwide. In 2022 alone, approximately 20 million new cancer cases were diagnosed, and 9.7 million people died from the disease. By 2050, annual cancer cases are expected to reach 35 million, driving demand for innovative treatments like immunotherapy. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative to traditional therapies, and its applications are expanding as research advances. It can be applied to various types of cancer, either alone or alongside treatments like chemotherapy. Immunomodulating agents, a type of non-specific immunotherapy, help improve the body’s immune system's capability of detecting and attacking cancer cells. Read Also: 10 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $20 and 10 Best Cancer Stocks To Buy Now. Due to the growing demand for treatments, leading pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in research and development to expand the range of immunotherapy drugs available. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapies, and monoclonal antibodies. Combining different therapies and tailoring treatments to individual patients is helping to unlock new applications for immunotherapy, positioning it to revolutionize cancer care and other areas of medicine. North America led the global immunotherapy drugs industry in 2023, capturing over 48.19% of total revenue, driven by medical advancements and regulatory approvals, particularly in the US. The FDA's approval of immunotherapy for cancers with specific genetic traits, regardless of origin, highlights the region's leadership in innovative treatments like tumor-agnostic therapies. With over 2 million new cancer cases expected in the US in 2024, demand for effective treatments like immunotherapy will continue to grow. Organizations such as Canada’s National Research Council are also developing new immunotherapies, aiming to provide hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers like B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. We selected stocks from ETFs with immunotherapy exposure and narrowed down the list to the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. The hedge fund sentiment has been sourced from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company's flagship product, KIMMTRAK, has gained approval in multiple countries and is a leading treatment option for metastatic uveal melanoma.

In the second quarter, Immunocore Holdings plc (NASDAQ:IMCR) generated $75.3 million in net revenue from KIMMTRAK, marking a 7% increase from the first quarter. Growth was largely driven by an 11% revenue increase in the US, supported by a focus on community outreach and extended therapy duration. The company estimates a 65% market share in the US with room for further expansion. Overall, Immunocore Holdings plc (NASDAQ:IMCR) achieved a solid first half in 2024, with net sales reaching $146 million—a 34% increase over the same period last year. Immunocore Holdings plc's (NASDAQ:IMCR) pipeline also includes promising treatments for chronic hepatitis delta and chronic hepatitis B, currently in advanced stages of development. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects, driven by the continued success of KIMMTRAK. The stock has received a consensus Buy rating. Overall IMCR ranks 10th on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of IMCR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

November 18, 2024 08:15 ET | Source: Watershed Watershed SAN FRANCISCO, CA & LONDON, UK, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watershed, the enterprise sustainability platform, announced today that it has facilitated the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) on behalf of customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block. The purchases, coordinated with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), will add high-integrity sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) directly to Alaska Airlines passenger flights, and the SAFc will be applied to the companies’ corporate footprints to compensate for business travel emissions. This investment supports the production and use of SAF, an emerging climate technology for air travel. The purchases are part of SABA’s largest-ever collection of deals, announced in April 2024: commitments expected to result in $200M of SAFc worth roughly 50 million gallons of SAF, or 500,000 tonnes of abated CO2e over the next five years. Watershed is an aggregator partner of SABA, which accelerates investment in, and adoption of, sustainable aviation fuel. With this purchase, Watershed customers including BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block are participants in SABA. “We see collective engagement in the SAF market as a compelling demand signal,” said Claire Kiely, Head of Watershed Marketplace Carbon Supply. “Watershed consolidates our customers’ demand for high-impact, low-carbon technology like sustainable aviation fuel, then works with SAF suppliers, airlines, and experts through SABA to meet that demand and grow an essential new sector. By participating in this historic investment, Watershed customers are providing a powerful demand signal for SAF and affirming the role SAFc will play in corporate emissions reduction initiatives.” “Alaska Airlines is all-in on advancing the market for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), a critical element in the path to decarbonize aviation,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Alaska Airlines. "We are one of the founding members of SABA’s Aviators group because we know that we will only reach our destination if we’re tackling this challenge from all angles–business, policy, financing, and more. Investing in SAF alongside partners like Watershed, BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block helps us scale up use and provides critical demand signals for the market. We’re grateful for their leadership and partnership, and look forward to even more collaboration as they join SABA." “Aggregator partners like Watershed play a pivotal role in helping accelerate the growth of green commodity markets. By consolidating demand among its customers, Watershed is helping SABA send a larger demand signal to the SAF market while enabling us to welcome a new set of leading corporations. SAFc purchases from BlackRock, Ripple, Samsara, and Block further our efforts to decarbonize the future of flight,” said Kim Carnahan, Head of SABA’s Secretariat and CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation. "Ripple remains committed to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and joining the push for sustainable aviation fuel is an important step in our journey to net-zero carbon by 2030,” said Ken Weber, VP of Social Impact & Sustainability at Ripple. “We’re thrilled to work with SABA, Watershed, and alongside other leading organizations to help advance the most promising, scalable climate positive energy solutions. We see sustainable aviation fuel as a key pathway toward decarbonizing air travel, a vital global industry, and through collaboration with Watershed and SABA we are not only supporting the growth of SAF, but also empowering other companies to take similar meaningful steps in reducing their emissions footprint.” SAF is made with renewable or waste feedstocks. It can be used in today's aircraft without investments to upgrade existing fleets and infrastructure, and can significantly reduce the carbon emissions from flights. SAF purchased through the SABA transaction will achieve, on average, an 80% reduction in carbon intensity relative to conventional jet fuel. While the industry is growing rapidly, SAF still makes up less than 0.5% of global jet fuel supply and today sells at a premium compared to fossil jet fuel. To scale and meet its full potential, the nascent SAF sector needs both market support—through strong corporate demand and investment—and robust infrastructure. SABA’s book and claim model is designed to set up intentional, high-integrity market infrastructure for the long term. In addition to pooling corporate demand for SAF purchasing, SABA has put in place tracking, registry, and reporting mechanisms that validate SAF as a carbon dioxide reduction commodity. ### ABOUT WATERSHED: Watershed is the enterprise sustainability platform. Companies like Airbnb, Carlyle Group, FedEx, Visa, and Dr. Martens use Watershed to manage climate and ESG data, produce audit-ready metrics for voluntary and regulatory reporting including CSRD, and facilitate real decarbonization. Watershed is the platform of choice for companies seeking to reduce emissions, meet customer, investor and regulatory requirements, and modernize their sustainability programs. Watershed customers also have exclusive access to a marketplace of pre-vetted, high-quality carbon projects and groundbreaking virtual power purchase agreements.

Title: ‘Dying A Slow Death’: Has Ethereum Lost Wall Street’s Favor To Bitcoin?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2024/11/18/dying-a-slow-death-has-ethereum-lost-wall-streets-favor-to-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-11-18T12:51:05Z
Full Content:
Blackrock Ethereum has broken an eight-year support trend against Bitcoin, raising questions about the second-largest cryptocurrency’s future. “Dying a slow death”—that’s how Tuur Demeester, founder of Bitcoin hedge fund Adamant Capital, described Ethereum, pointing to the broken trendline to a canary in the coal mine. Crypto analysts blame Ethereum’s setback on slow institutional adoption, where Bitcoin continues to dominate. This could have deeper implications for Ethereum’s positioning as an asset class. Ethereum’s struggles come during a mixed week for the broader crypto market. Bitcoin’s price is flat Monday, hovering around the $90,000 mark, while Ethereum has dropped 0.3% to $3,080. Altcoins are a mixed bag: Solana is up 4.6%, Dogecoin is flat, XRP has gained 7.2%, BNB is down 2.3%, and Cardano is up 2.9%. According to Kaiko, a crypto data firm, Bitcoin’s dominance over Ethereum is due to its superior adoption among institutional investors, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The disparity became more evident with the launch of crypto ETFs—with Bitcoin ETFs drawing significantly higher trading volumes than Ethereum ETFs. In fact, Bitcoin ETFs garnered more than $47 billion in assets within their first 30 days, while Ethereum ETFs brought in just over $6.7 billion, according to Amberdata, a crypto analytics firm. “The divergence in performance and on-chain activity can also be attributed to the distinct value propositions of Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Amberdata noted in a recent report. “Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ has a simple and well-defined narrative as a store of value and inflation hedge, thanks in part to its fixed supply of 21 million BTC.” Bitcoin benefits from its fixed supply and simpler use case. Ethereum—though more versatile—suffers from scalability challenges and regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding its transition to a proof-of-stake model. The divide extends to institutional endorsement. Bitcoin ETFs have already earned their name on Wall Street. For example, earlier this year, Fidelity added Bitcoin ETFs to 401(k) plans, while Morgan Stanley allowed its financial advisors to recommend these ETFs to clients. Ethereum, by contrast, has not received as much institutional backing. Even the best-performing Ethereum funds lag behind Bitcoin in terms of adoption and media attention, according to Amberdata. Demeester’s remark may be a bit of a stretch, but it reflects growing concerns about Ethereum’s positioning as an alternative asset class. To regain its edge, experts argue that Ethereum must address scalability issues and redefine its role as a technology-driven asset rather than competing directly with Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Until then, institutional dollars appear to favor Bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

November 18, 2024 07:17 ET | Source: FBS Markets FBS Markets SINGAPORE, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FBS, a leading global broker, explores the rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and their transformative impact on international finance. Representing tangible and intangible assets like real estate and private credit digitally on blockchains, RWAs are redefining asset ownership by enabling fractional ownership and boosting liquidity. This innovation is reshaping global finance, offering retail and institutional investors more accessible and diversified portfolios. FBS analysts emphasize the significant advantages of RWAs, including reduced barriers to entry, streamlined operations, and democratized access to high-value assets. The surge in adoption is evident, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where institutions like BlackRock and UBS are integrating tokenized assets into their offerings. These advancements highlight the role of RWAs in bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, addressing inefficiencies and expanding global market participation. However, FBS also notes the challenges that come with this innovation. Scalability, regulation, and the need for robust blockchain infrastructure are key hurdles. FBS analysts suggest that as technology advances, solutions to these challenges will further solidify RWAs as a cornerstone of future financial ecosystems. For traders, understanding the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market is critical, offering new opportunities to align with emerging trends. Tokenization offers the potential to unlock trillions of dollars in otherwise inaccessible assets, broadening their availability to a wider audience. This innovation is reshaping industries like real estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property. By integrating RWAs into the global economy, tokenization is driving changes in asset management, trading practices, and portfolio diversification strategies. FBS analysts highlight the importance of keeping a close eye on the tokenized asset space. By staying informed about regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market trends, traders and investors can strategically position themselves to capitalize on this transformative wave. RWAs represent a significant evolution in financial systems, marking a shift toward a more inclusive and efficient global financial ecosystem.

Check out our latest analysis for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: I earn $200,000 at Google after starting my career earning under $40,000. The reality is that money does buy happiness.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Khayla McCoy, a 33-year-old business analyst who more than quadrupled her income over 10 years. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I grew up in Madisonville, Tennessee, where many people live below the poverty line. The only conversations we had were about lacking things — having enough money for basic needs felt far-fetched. I always knew I wanted to achieve financial freedom. I graduated in 2013 with a degree in biology and landed my first job in New York City as a sessions assistant, making $39,000 a year. I was the first person in my family to make that much money. By 2019, I was making $90,000. Now I make over $200,000 annually in total compensation. Having more money has truly made me happier. When I moved to New York, I had two roommates and had to stick to a strict budget to afford my expenses, from rent, about $1,250, to student loans and everyday costs. My salary barely covered my bills, but I was committed to finding ways to afford living there. I knew my first job would be a stepping stone to bigger roles and higher-paying salaries. I enrolled in a personal-finance course from Ellevest and attended events I found on Meetup. I learned financial discipline and started planning ahead for unforeseen expenses and developing a method for organizing my money. I set up different cash accounts for recurring bills, emergency savings, and everyday spending needs. I hesitated to take risks with my money. At first, I deferred investing in stocks and a 401(k). Shortly after I turned 24, I finally felt like I was finding my financial footing and began investing about 5% of my salary in my 401(k). I started to understand the benefits of investing in the market. As my salary increased, I invested more in my 401(k) and other investment accounts. My family was proud of me, and I achieved many people's dreams of living and working in New York City, but I had a paralyzing fear I'd mess up my career and end up with no money. I stayed at my sessions-assistant job for two years, and my salary grew to $42,000. In 2015, I had a family emergency and left the workforce for two years. When I could work again, I moved back to New York, decided to pause my career in healthcare, and pivoted. I enrolled in an associate degree program from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in beauty-industry merchandising and marketing, which cost $30,000. I took out more student loans for this degree. In 2017, I landed a job in consumer packaged goods, making $50,700. After two years at that company, I decided I needed a better-paying job. I took a data-science course at General Assembly to learn how to use, analyze, and drive insights from data. The course cost $4,000, which was covered by a tuition-reimbursement program at my former company. In 2019, I got a job at BlackRock as a data analyst, which doubled my former salary. I was proud of myself, but I still had recurring anxiety about losing the job and the money. In 2021, I landed a job at Google, bumping up my salary again. That's when my finances seriously changed — and so did my level of happiness. When I started at Google, my base salary was $132,000. I felt financially stable for the first time. I knew I had the money to pay for whatever was thrown my way. When I faced a health scare this year, I had health insurance and a savings account to help me pay for those expenses without taking on medical debt. My total medical expenses were over $60,000 — I never could've covered them without my current salary and benefits. When you come from a lower socioeconomic background, you become accustomed to believing many things you need are actually wants, such as going to the dentist for an annual exam and cleaning. I'd convince myself to skip it because I thought I needed to stretch my cash to see how far it could go. It took a while to redefine my budget. When I was 30, I felt like I finally figured it out because I'd seen myself change my circumstances and create a much different life than the one I grew up in. When I was making less money, I felt like I had to be perfect at that job because I wanted to be considered indispensable to the company. Now I don't want to lose my job, but I would have a cushion if that happened. The other reason work feels less stressful is that my mindset has become more peaceful now that I'm not always thinking about money. I became the person in my friend group everyone came to for financial advice, so I started an online community that helps women define their relationship with money. I hope to use my money lessons to help others make better financial decisions. When people say money doesn't buy happiness, I tell them I disagree and give examples of how healthcare, safe shelter, and the ability to engage in hobbies and take healthy risks all support health and happiness. If I can't afford to make doctor's appointments or get my car fixed, those things directly impact my ability to show up in the world how I want. I always had a voice in my head that said if you want to have a chance to live a comfortable and productive life, you'll need to make a lot of money. That's the reality of it for me. Jump to

Title: Is Ericsson (ERIC) A Cheap NASDAQ Stock To Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (NASDAQ:ERIC) stands against other cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. The stock market has been following an uptrend since it rebounded from the bear market in Q4 2022. The bear market that ended in Q2 2022 was regarded to be a fed-induced low as the interest rates were high during that time. However, since then the S&P 500 has finished higher in seven out of the eight quarters, including four consecutive quarters of growth. Over the last four quarters, the index has returned 36.3%. This figure is significant because such high return rates were last seen when the market was recovering from 2020 COVID-19 lows. READ MORE: 8 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 10 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now. There has been significant stimulus for the bull market to continue ranging from the Fed cutting rates to the China stimulus, and an easing economy with strong data points. Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and WisdomTree chief economist shared his note on November 11 talking about the economic landscape and his perception of the election results. He describes last week as one of the most pivotal in recent memory, starting with the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points during its November meeting. This decision reflects a cautious approach, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s omission of phrases like “further progress” about inflation suggests a recognition that inflationary progress has plateaued. Siegel aligned with Powell’s assessment of rental inflation, indicating that the Fed is now fully aware of disinflationary trends within the housing sector. Siegel anticipates another rate cut at the December meeting, contingent on upcoming economic data, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), retail sales figures, and the November jobs report. He notes that if these indicators show weaker-than-expected results, it could increase pressure on the Fed to implement further cuts. Over the past 2 years starting from November 16, 2022, the NASDAQ composite has seen a 73% rise during this bull market. Analysts are now debating whether we can have a third year of this bull market or not. To discuss this, Nick Colas, DataTrek Research co-founder, joined CNBC on October 26. Colas thinks that this is a positive sign for the index and that there is still room for the NASDAQ to run higher. He pointed out that if we look back at 1971 when the index started, since then we have had 10 instances where the index rallied for two straight years. Historic data shows that in six of these 10 times, the NASDAQ index continued to rally for the third year as well and in four instances it didn’t. Colas mentioned that the overall average return of these 10 years was 4.4%, which was not very impressive, however, the lower return rate was due to the 4 losing years when the index failed to rally. The four losing years as pointed out by Colas were 1984, 1987, 1990, and 2011. Three of these 4 years were characterized by crises including the 1987 market crash, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and the European debt crisis in 2011. If we take these 4 years out of the equation, the overall return for the NASDAQ in year three is 13.3%. Therefore, Colas believes that as long as we don’t have any crisis events, the momentum is historically said to continue in year three. Colas thinks the index should have at least a 10% return during the third year as historically speaking the index has delivered as much as 20% return rates during the third year. He acknowledges that many analysts think that since we have had two very strong years of growth the third might be a disappointment. However, Colas believes that today’s market environment is much healthier than the one we have had in history, and, based on that, the NASDAQ still has room to run. To curate the list of 10 cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. We used the screener to get an aggregated list of NASDAQ stocks that are trading below the average Forward P/E of 25.37 (as per Wall Street Journal). Next, we checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order, based on the number of hedge funds holding each stock in Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks Forward Price to Earnings Ratio: 18.15 Earnings Growth: 9.30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 8 Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), commonly known as Ericsson, is a Swedish multinational company specializing in telecommunications and networking technology. Founded in 1876, Ericsson provides essential infrastructure, services, and software to the telecommunications industry and other sectors. The company operates through three main business segments including Networks, IT & Cloud, and Media. It generates revenue by selling hardware for mobile networks including the emerging 5G technologies. Moreover, the company also generates substantial revenue from its managed services and consulting related to cloud infrastructure. In its recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 report, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) emphasized its strategic focus on developing programmable networks that enhance performance and enable new revenue-generating applications. This approach is designed to go beyond traditional consumer mobile broadband by creating new use cases for enterprises and mission-critical operations, which are currently underutilized in revenue generation. Although the organic sales of the company declined during the third quarter by 1% year-over-year, it was still an improvement subsequently. North America became one of the strongest contenders with a strong 55% growth, driven by significant contract wins. As a result, the gross margins of the company improved from 39.2% during the previous year to 46.3% in Q3 2024. Moreover, EBITDA also improved to $728.66 million from $438 million in the comparable quarter last year. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) also demonstrated strong free cash flow generation capability during the quarter which came at $1.20 billion for the quarter, up from negative $46.71 million during last year. It is one of the cheapest NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. Overall, ERIC ranks 10th on our list of cheap NASDAQ stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of ERIC to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ERIC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, cautioning the U.S. to "make the wise choice" for the sake of bilateral relations. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" — shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example — were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week — both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high. Those were the worries weighing on markets last week, which brought the S&P back to its level in mid-October, noted CNBC's Michael Santoli. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. — CNBC's Michael Santoli, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for an unique experience

Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. Joanne Cronin Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

Caught in the crossfire China may be the target of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's hawkish trade policies, but U.S. companies could suffer in the crossfire. If Trump does implement his tariffs on China, the Chinese government could retaliate by introducing its own tariffs, diversifying its imports away from the U.S and increasing scrutiny of U.S. firms operating in China. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, saying: "China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences." To infinity Pure-play space companies have seen their shares soar over the past week. For example, shares of Rocket Lab, an aerospace manufacturer, popped 41% on a weekly basis. While that was ignited by positive news from the company's earnings report, analysts say the "Trump-Elon" trade is also behind the gravity-defying moves of space stocks. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" — shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example — were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week — both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high – which were the worries weighing on markets last week. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the ARK Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against ARK Invest's top stock picks for 2024. ARK Investment Management LLC, more commonly known as ARK Invest, is an American investment management firm headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, that oversees several actively managed ETFs. It was registered in 2014 by Catherine Wood, who is known for making big bets on disruptive technology like self-driving carse and genomics. The investment fund has around $6.7 billion in assets under management. READ ALSO: Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks and Jim Cramer November Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks. Wood’s flagship fund has faced pressures for the third straight year, with outflows at nearly $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2024, which was close to triple the outflows seen in 2023. Its closing price of $57.85 on November 11 was down 60% from the highs of early 2021. In a letter posted to investors in July, she acknowledged that the fund’s performance was challenged by certain stock picks and the overall macroeconomic environment, but added that ‘our conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered’. The ARK Invest CEO argued that the fund’s holdings were set to benefit once the Fed rate cuts begin and that she anticipates another period of strong returns, reminiscent of the gains witnessed during the initial days of the pandemic. In August this year, in the hope of buying the dip, Wood piled into several tech stocks whose shares had tumbled in the months prior. Since the announcement of interest rate cuts in September, ARK’s flagship ETF has grown 25%, with a major upward spike in the week running up to and following the presidential elections, which Donald Trump won on November 5. In a post-election message released to investors, Wood likened the country’s current economic situation to the Reagan era in the early 1980s, when the interest rate and tax cuts resulted in robust economic growth, eventually helping the United States grow out of deficit and into a surplus in the Clinton era. Cathie Wood predicts a bright future and has stated that Trump’s policies will ‘turbocharge’ the American economy more powerfully than the Reagan Revolution did. She expects the newly elected president to slash regulations and cut tax rates, as he did during his first term. Trump during his election campaign vowed to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15%, after having already cut the rate from 35% to 21% in his presidency between 2017 and 2021. Having said that, Wood believes that businesses will put investments on hold until the promised cuts are delivered, which means the positive anticipated impact on the economy will be delayed. We scanned the ARK Investment Management portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:SQ) is an American company that offers financial services to clients through its two segments: Square and Cash App. The Square segment includes managed payment services, hardware, software solutions, and other financial services that help sellers start and run their businesses. The Cash App segment offers consumers financial tools via the mobile app, allowing them to make payments, invest in stocks and bitcoin, and more. The company was formerly known as Square, Inc., until 2021, when it decided to change the name to Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), reflecting its growing focus on crypto and blockchain technologies. On November 7, the company held its third-quarter earnings call, announcing results that trailed Wall Street’s revenue expectations. Revenue for Q3 was posted at $5.98 billion, falling short of the expected $6.24 billion, signaling softening consumer demand. However, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) narrowly beat profit expectations, logging an EPS of $0.88. This was one cent higher than estimates and was powered by company-wide expense discipline. Shares have fallen 4% since these results, but analysts remain bullish on the stock and have a consensus BUY rating, with a median share price upside potential of 10.3%. They believe that a soft landing for the economy with Fed cuts is likely to boost consumer spending in the months ahead. ARK Invest has the largest stake in the company, valued at over $444 million, as of September 30, 2024. The investment represents 4.06% of ARK’s portfolio, making Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) one of the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio. Overall SQ ranks 5th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) on Substack by Lorenzo Bastianelli. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ODD. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD)'s share was trading at $45.70 as of Nov 12th. ODD’s trailing P/E was 28.04 according to Yahoo Finance. A data analyst using cutting-edge analytics to accurately interpret complex sets of data. Oddity Tech's recent performance has garnered attention, with the stock surging 20% in the week following its November 7 earnings release, signaling that the market may finally be recognizing its potential. The company reported strong third-quarter results for the period ending September 30, 2024, exceeding its financial guidance across all key metrics. Net revenue reached a record $119 million, reflecting a 26% year-over-year increase, well above its targeted 20% growth. The company also demonstrated an increase in free cash flow per share, a positive indicator for future stock performance. Repeat purchases from loyal customers continued to grow, now accounting for over 50% of revenue, even as the company expanded by more than 25%. Looking ahead, Oddity is primed for further growth. The company is set to launch two new brands in the second half of 2025—Brand 3, a telehealth platform for skin and body concerns, and Brand 4, which will also cater to its existing customer base. CEO Oran Holtzman shared insights into the progress of Brand 3, including the establishment of a telehealth infrastructure, a physician and pharmacist network, and large-scale consumer studies for testing new products and treatments. This direct-to-consumer platform, coupled with the use of generative AI in treatment planning, is expected to further enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth. Holtzman also highlighted the strategic importance of Oddity Lab, which now boasts 60 scientists and a newly expanded facility in Kendall Square, Boston. This investment in research and development underscores Oddity's ambition to become one of the largest beauty companies globally. Despite some concerns about the lack of transparency around key performance indicators, the company’s promising financial results and ambitious growth strategy position it for continued success. Oddity’s stock remains undervalued, priced as though it’s in a worst-case scenario, offering investors significant upside potential. Oddity presents a compelling investment opportunity, with strong consumer loyalty, a promising pipeline of new brands, and an expanding scientific team positioning the company for sustained growth. The recent surge in the stock price, combined with a high short interest of 32.29% as of mid-October, indicates that there could still be significant upside potential. When a stock with high short interest performs well, it can trigger a "short squeeze," forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further driving the price higher. This mix of solid earnings and elevated short interest suggests that the stock may continue to rise as market sentiment shifts and adjusts to the company’s strong fundamentals. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held ODD at the end of the second quarter which was 23 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ODD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ODD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:PATH) is an artificial intelligence software and enterprise automation company that offers a range of robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. It was founded in Bucharest, Romania, in 2005 and is now headquartered in New York City. The stock has lost 47% of its share value year-to-date due to an abrupt CEO change and lower guidance for the full year declared at the end of the first fiscal quarter, which spooked investors. Despite the crash, Cathie Wood, in late May, purchased shares worth $28 million of one of her favorite AI stocks. The share price is beginning to recover and has gained 5% since the announcement of strong results for Q2 2025 on September 5. During the quarter, the company beat its guidance and posted significant growth in key financial metrics. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)’s ARR grew 19% year-over-year to a total of $1.55 billion, attributed to a net new ARR of $43 million. Revenue for the quarter was posted at $316 million, up 10% from last year. The company also witnessed a robust increase in its cloud ARR, for both hybrid and SaaS, which ended the quarter at $850 million, representing a 65% increase. The number of customers with $1 million or more in ARR increased to 293, while those with at least $100,000 in ARR grew to 2,163 customers. EPS for the quarter was logged at $0.04, beating expectations of $0.03. After impressive results in Q2 2025, UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) has raised its guidance for the third quarter. It anticipates revenue between $345 million and $350 million, an ARR between $1.60 billion and $1.605 billion, and a non-GAAP operating income of around $27 million. The company is committed to focusing on its growth products and enhancing partnerships to become a more customer-centric organization. Wall Street analysts are still cautious about the stock, with a consensus Hold rating. However, they forecast a median share price upside potential of 12% for UiPath. It is among the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio, representing 2.45% of its holdings. Overall PATH ranks 10th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024.

Title: Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY): A Bull Case Theory

Time Published: 2024-11-17T22:00:26Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) on Substack by Idea Hive. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMPY. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY)'s stock was trading at $6.74 as of Nov 12th. AMPY’s trailing and forward P/E were 4.35 and 5.48 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A drilling rig fueled by the energy and expertise of the oil & gas exploration and production company. Amplify Energy (AMPY) continues to present a compelling investment opportunity within the energy sector, trading at undemanding multiples of approximately 4x 2024E EBITDA and 8x FCF. These multiples reflect the company’s solid cash generation from its low-decline, long-reserve-life oil and gas assets, especially as it ramps up development at its Beta oilfield. The Beta development is particularly promising, with the potential for substantial value creation as AMPY drills new wells and further expands its output. Recently, AMPY reported positive progress on this front, with the second well drilled in Q2 exceeding expectations, achieving production rates of 500 bpd, well above the company’s initial guidance. The third well drilled in Q3 also produced impressive results, with a 30-day production rate of 590 bpd, significantly higher than the initial forecast of 350 bpd. The well’s capital expenditure was in line with projections, and management expects it to pay out within 6 to 9 months, highlighting the strong economics of the Beta asset. With a new well expected to come online in mid-November, AMPY’s ability to scale the Beta development looks promising, with further updates expected in Q1 2025. Operationally, AMPY delivered another strong quarter, maintaining steady production and ample free cash flow. However, the company’s decision to retain its Bairoil asset, after evaluating various proposals, reflects the challenges in the crude oil market and the volatility in pricing. While a divestiture would have been ideal for reducing debt and potentially initiating a large capital return, AMPY’s management has indicated that they are open to future transactions if market conditions improve. Despite this setback, AMPY remains focused on its core assets, particularly Beta, which is key to its growth. From a valuation perspective, AMPY’s stock remains attractive. The market currently ascribes minimal value to the Beta asset, pricing it at around $66 million based on current multiples. However, given the successful drilling results and strong cash flow potential of Beta, this figure seems conservative. In fact, modeling Beta’s potential cash flow generation, including a more optimistic production scenario, suggests that the asset could generate up to $280 million in free cash flow over the next four years, potentially representing 70% of AMPY’s current enterprise value. As the market becomes more aware of Beta’s value, AMPY is likely to experience a re-rating, particularly as management updates its reserve figures by year-end. Given the continued success of Beta and the company’s overall solid performance, AMPY remains an attractive investment. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) is also not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 13 hedge fund portfolios held AMPY at the end of the second quarter which was 18 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMPY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMPY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We came across a bullish thesis on APi Group Corporation (APG) on Substack by Kairos research. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on APG. APi Group Corporation (APG)'s share was trading at $36.96 as of Nov 12th. APG’s forward P/E was 17.61 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. API Group, a leader in industrial services, has carved a strong niche in fire safety, primarily through targeted acquisitions and a strategic shift towards recurring, inspection-led revenue. Over the past decades, API has built a portfolio of around 100 niche businesses, primarily fire safety providers, which align with its recession-resistant model grounded in regulatory mandates, such as those from the National Fire Protection Association. This core fire safety segment contributes 70% of revenue, driven by recurring, high-margin inspections and monitoring services. Rather than pursuing large, cyclical contracts for new installations, API’s sales force focuses on winning recurring inspection services for existing buildings. This inspection-led approach not only secures ongoing revenue but also uncovers compliance issues that lead to additional services, offering a substantial revenue multiplier. For each dollar earned through inspections, API often generates an additional three to four dollars in follow-up services, all at a higher margin, which strengthens its bottom line. This model also allows API to selectively target high-margin specialty projects, further enhancing profitability. Since going public in 2020, API has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy, completing 25 acquisitions to bolster its fire safety portfolio. A recent high-profile purchase of Chubb, acquired at a premium valuation of 14x EBITDA, underscored API’s commitment to expanding its safety services. Typically, API seeks acquisitions with strong cultural fit and synergy potential, paying disciplined valuations in the 4x to 7x EBITDA range. By transitioning newly acquired businesses to its inspection-focused model, API optimizes margin performance across its portfolio. The company targets an EBITDA margin of 13% by 2025, with potential to expand to 15%, driven by recurring revenues that now make up 53% of sales. API aims for 10% organic growth in its inspection segment, with some investors advocating a divestment of its lower-margin specialty segment to concentrate on high-margin safety services. API's capital allocation strategies reflect its focus on quality revenue. The company has actively divested cyclical assets and lower-margin clients, creating a leaner revenue mix centered around high-margin fire safety. This approach has led to incremental margin gains, and with leverage reduced to a 2.4x net ratio, API has initiated a $1 billion share repurchase program, with $400 million still available. Despite a seemingly low return on invested capital (ROIC) due to goodwill and debt, API’s adjusted ROIC is closer to 7% and could improve as the safety segment grows. The company’s parallels with high-margin peers like Otis Worldwide and TopBuild suggest the potential for ROIC in the 10-20% range if capital allocation remains disciplined. Risks to API’s growth include regulatory shifts in fire safety codes, which could affect inspection demand, although regulatory tightening is more probable than loosening. Cyclical pressures in the specialty services segment, which remains economically sensitive, may mask API’s underlying fundamentals. The Chubb acquisition offers growth potential but underscores the importance of prudent integration to avoid value erosion. Valuation projections indicate that the safety segment will continue to outpace specialty services, likely accounting for 81-83% of revenue by 2030, driven by bolt-on acquisitions and organic demand. Maintaining net debt below 2.5x EBITDA remains a priority as API balances growth with financial stability. With an 18% upside, API offers compelling long-term returns, provided it maintains growth in its asset-light safety business. If API succeeds in sustaining demand for inspections and focusing on high-margin services, the company is well-positioned to deliver attractive returns for investors. APi Group Corporation (APG) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 52 hedge fund portfolios held APG at the end of the second quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. According to the September updated edition of the report, “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff Advanced Nuclear” by the US Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. nuclear power sector is set to triple in capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to around 300 GW by 2050, driven by increased electricity demand and the need for reliable, carbon-free power. Recent demand surges from artificial intelligence and data centers are encouraging significant investment in nuclear power. Nuclear also plays a vital role in the energy transition, the United States power systems require an additional 700–900 GW of clean firm capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. The current nuclear fleet, comprising 94 reactors across 54 sites, provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and nearly half of its carbon-free power. To support nuclear expansion, the U.S. government has bolstered the sector with tax credits, loans, and research funding. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) production and investment tax credits for new reactors and existing plants are expected to play a pivotal role. In 2024, Congress provided a $2.72 billion allocation for developing a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain and passed the ADVANCE Act to improve licensing process efficiency. Congress also allocated $900 million specifically for Gen III+ Small modular reactors (SMRs). Small modular reactors (SMRs) are an alternative to traditional nuclear plants and offer a promising new opportunity for nuclear energy. SMRs are a type of nuclear reactor with a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit. They are manufactured off-site and shipped to the location for installation, making them more cost-effective and suitable for a wider range of areas. In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 1, Aniket Shah, Global Head of Sustainability and Transition Strategy at Jefferies, discussed the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States, particularly in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where plants are set to reopen to support the growing demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. Shah emphasized that this development is not surprising, given the long-known need for increased power demand and the role of nuclear energy in the energy transition. Shah highlighted that the International Energy Agency’s long-term forecast has consistently shown the need to double or triple global nuclear capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. He also pointed out that the US signed an agreement at the Conference of the Parties (COP) nine months ago to triple nuclear capacity over the next couple of decades. Shah attributed the recent momentum in nuclear energy to the growing demand from the tech industry, which is willing to pay a premium for firm and clean power to meet their climate commitments. Shah noted that Big Tech companies will play a significant role in driving the nuclear renaissance, not only by investing in nuclear power but also in small modular reactors and potentially nuclear fusion. He also emphasized the bipartisan support for nuclear energy in the US, citing the passage of the ADVANCE Act to streamline nuclear approvals and the willingness of politicians from both parties to support nuclear energy. However, Shah acknowledged that the industry faces significant challenges, including a lack of skills and capacity to deliver on the required scale, and that the process of building a new industry will take time. The tech industry’s demand for energy is driving a surprising trend as big tech companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power to fuel their operations. As demand for clean electricity grows, tech companies are recognizing its potential to provide a reliable, low-carbon source of power for their data centers and AI operations. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now.

The company’s Point Beach facility in Wisconsin produces about 1,200 megawatts of power, which is around one-sixth of Florida’s electricity. Whereas, Seabrook Station generates over 1,250 megawatts of electricity. NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) Duane Arnold Energy Center, Iowa’s only nuclear power plant, located northeast of Palo, Iowa ceased operations in August 2020 after serving for 45 years. In Q3, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced that the company is considering restarting Duane Arnold nuclear plant in response to increasing demand from data centers. During the Q3 earnings call, John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and CEO of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), noted that Duane Arnold, a 601 MW boiling water reactor (BWR), is generally less complex and costly to recommission than pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The company expects to pursue this project at an attractive cost with minimal risk. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is currently conducting engineering assessments and coordinating with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on a possible restart due to significant interest from data center clients. Overall, NEE ranks 6th on our list of best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now.

Title: AIL round-up: St Mary’s strike late to hold Cork Con to draw as Ballynahinch march on

Newly-promoted St Mary’s underlined their play-off credentials with a hard-earned 27-27 draw away to the champions Cork Con, which maintained their record of gleaning at least two points from each of their seven games this season and kept them in second place. Con gained an additional bonus point. Thepick of their tries came from the returning Billy Crowley and was created by Eoghan Smyth’s lovely left-to-right pass as the former Midleton player continues to impress. But St Mary’s drew level through a late try by 36-year-old prop Andy Keating. “This is the most competitive league I’ve known in all my time involved in the club game,” said Con’s Brian Hickey, “and a very, very good standard in my opinion.” Leaders Ballynahinch recorded their fifth bonus-point win in succession since losing 51-21 in Temple Hill. Their latest victory was a 24-19 home triumph over UCD, earned thanks to tries by winger Ethan Graham, hooker Claytan Milligan (two) and George Pringle, with conversions by James Humphreys and Conor Rankin. As UCD were bulk suppliers to Leinster A’s 28-7 win over the Connacht Eagles, this was a creditable bonus point for them. UCD’s tries were scored by Bobby Sheehan, who captained the side, Mark Canniffe and Oisin Spain. Lansdowne will be buoyed by a badly needed 26-17 win over Clontarf on the Aviva back pitch. It came courtesy of a brace of tries by their ever-dependable, go-to centre Andy Marks and one by flanker Paul Wilson. Terenure returned to winning ways and remained in the top four in an entertaining 42-26 win over Garryowen at Lakelands Park. The home side started strongly and had a bonus point by the 50th minute thanks to ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey, who made an impressive first start, Adam La Grue, Adam Melia and a penalty try. But Garryowen kept bouncing back. Winger Colm Quilligan scored off a long pass by Tom Wood, and a rampaging run by number eight Brian Gleeson. When a penalty try of their own was augmented by lock Finn McCall, who recently won a Meades Cup medal with Thames Valley, that made it 32-26 inside the last 10 minutes But a penalty by Aran Egan and a slaloming finish by Conor Phillips sealed a Terenure win that was tarnished by Marcus Hanan and Harrison Brewer being helped off. Old Belvedere continued to set a hot pace in 1B with a 43-24 win in Queen’s, although Nenagh Ormond’s 42-15 win away to Shannon underlined a shift in the balance of power between those two. The 2A leaders, Corinthians, suffered their first defeat of the campaign but, despite missing eight players with the Eagles, achieved two bonus points in a 41-39 defeat at home to Cashel. Instonians and Greystones ensured one point covered the top three by scoring 19 tries between them in 61-29 and 71-8 wins at home to Barnhall and Buccaneers.

Title: Who Really Profits From The Ukraine War?

November 18, 2024 Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business – namely, opportunity. It’s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine’s vast agricultural lands – among the most fertile in the world – are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. RFK Jr. Deftly and clearly explains. JP Morgan and BlackRock — From Financiers of Destruction to Half-Trillion Dollar ‘Heroes’ of Reconstruction – The Hypocrisy of Reconstruction of Ukraine by the Same Corporations that Profited from the War JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country’s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a “blended finance” approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The “fund of reconstruction” proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country’s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company’s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey’s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process. Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Title: Ann-Marie McGlynn and Keelan Kilrehill prove a class apart to claim national cross country titles

Keelan Kilrehill of Moy Valley AC, Mayo, cannot believe he is about to win the senior men's race at the Cross Country Championships at Castle Irvine Estate in Irvinestown, Fermanagh. Photo: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile For Ann-Marie McGlynn and Keelan Kilrehill, this afternoon’s 123.ie National Cross Country Championships served up the chance to write their own pieces of Irish athletics history. The pair proved a class apart in the senior races over 7,500m at the Castle Irvine Estate in Fermanagh, with McGlynn winning the women’s title by 11 seconds and Kilrehill the men’s by a whopping 28 seconds. McGlynn, a Tullamore native running for Letterkenny AC, became the first athlete to win the national marathon and cross country titles in the same year, the 44-year-old’s victory coming just three weeks after she clocked a 2:34:05 marathon in Dublin. “It just shows it can be done,” she said. “I can’t believe it. I’m not going to lie: it wasn’t even in the plan. I went to the Dublin Marathon and I suppose I didn’t have to go to the well and I came off it in great nick. I wasn’t sore. I took a full week off, no running, then called the club the week after and said, ‘Let’s go to the nationals.’” She hit the line in 27:05, 11 seconds clear of Niamh Allen, who led Leevale to the team title, with Tullamore’s Danielle Donegan taking bronze. The U-23 title went to Dundrum South Dublin’s Emma McEvoy, who finished eighth overall. McGlynn’s goal had been solely to help Letterkenny qualify for the European Clubs Cross Country but now she will lead the Irish team at next month’s European Cross Country in Antalya, Turkey. “I’ve done very little the last three weeks but I’m very fit so just have to tap into that wee bit of speed,” she said. “My strength probably paid off in the end as it was a tough, honest course – a workhorse course. You just had to grind it out and I’m very good at grinding it out. It was just my day.” Kilrehill (24) became the first man from a Connacht club to win the title for 111 years, the Sligo native giving Moy Valley AC one of their finest days after a devastating last two laps. Niall Murphy of Ennis Track claimed the U-23 title in second, just ahead of last year’s senior champion Cormac Dalton in third. “The minute I saw Efrem [Gidey] make a move and go to the front, I felt like I was so concentrated and ready for it,” said Kilrehill. “I went with him straight away and then when I felt like he wasn’t pushing on like I wanted, I was like, ‘Why not me? Why not have a go at this?’ “I ran with so much confidence, I was so proud of the way I ran it. It’s that one title I can’t finish athletics without, the one I’ve dreamt of and to win it like that, it’s unreal.” Gidey finished fourth while rising star Nick Griggs faded to seventh, the 19-year-old nonetheless assured of his place on the U-23 team for the Europeans and leading the Candour Track Club to victory in the team event. UCD’s Jonas Stafford showed all his class to claim the U-20 men’s title with a powerful last lap, coming home six seconds clear of Lagan Valley’s Frank McGrath, while Lucy Foster of Willowfield Harriers was a dominant winner of the U-20 women’s race, clocking 15:43 ahead of Annabel Morrison (16:04).

Title: monday.com Ltd. (MNDY): A Bull Case Theory

We came across a bullish thesis on monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) on Rijnberk InvestInsights’ Substack by Daan Rijnberk. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MNDY. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY)'s share was trading at $268.90 as of Nov 14th. MNDY’s trailing and forward P/E were 625.35 and 68.97 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A tech savvy businessperson working on multiple devices, utilizing the company's cloud-based platform. Monday.com recently experienced a significant stock price drop despite a strong third-quarter performance that beat expectations on revenue and earnings. Contrary to typical reasons for such a decline, Monday’s results were solid—management is effectively driving growth, expanding margins, and increasing retention rates. The company exceeded Wall Street's top- and bottom-line estimates and even raised its full-year 2024 guidance. Yet, shares fell by 20% in just two days due to an elevated pre-earnings valuation of 93x earnings and 16x sales, which set high market expectations that couldn’t be met without an extraordinary outperformance. Thus, despite its operational success, Monday’s stock price retracted to August levels, around $270 per share, just above the $250 range previously identified as a buying opportunity. The fundamentals of Monday.com remain strong, with the company’s Q3 performance reinforcing confidence in its growth and profitability. Its low-code, no-code Work OS platform, which allows users to build custom work management solutions, continues to gain popularity. Since launching as a collaboration tool in 2014, Monday has expanded into other enterprise software areas, including CRM, human resources, and software development, allowing it to serve a diverse range of businesses. With a growth rate averaging 35% over the last three years and a 30% free cash flow (FCF) margin, Monday.com has established itself as a high-performing SaaS company worthy of its premium valuation. In its latest results, Monday reported Q3 revenue of $251 million, marking a 33% year-over-year increase. Demand remained strong, with limited slowdown despite industry-wide budget constraints. The company’s net retention rate climbed to 111%, up from 110%, driven by improved retention across both small and large customers. Monday’s strategy of expanding within its existing customer base through cross-selling and upselling has been key to sustaining growth. For instance, Monday’s second-largest client recently doubled its seat count, highlighting the effectiveness of its land-and-expand approach. By initially securing smaller deals and gradually offering additional products or upgrades, Monday maximizes revenue potential from each customer, expanding its footprint with both new and existing clients. The company’s dual growth engines—adding new customers and increasing revenue per existing user—are yielding positive results. Large customer accounts are growing faster than the company’s revenue, up 40% in Q3, as major clients continue to adopt more seats and products. This focus on innovation has seen Monday introduce new offerings within its platform each quarter, bolstering its ability to meet evolving business needs. Management expressed confidence in Monday’s role in shaping the future of work by continuously investing in new technologies and expanding its product suite. Currently, Monday is enhancing its AI capabilities with no-code AI features that allow customers to create tailored applications. Although still in beta, these AI features saw rapid adoption between Q2 and Q3, with usage increasing by 150%, underscoring a strong growth area that is likely to provide additional revenue streams. Beyond innovation, Monday’s efficient platform architecture gives it an edge in cost-effective product development, with multiple software stacks sharing a common core on its Work OS platform. This shared structure has enabled Monday to launch new solutions quickly and with minimal resources while maintaining high levels of customizability, a feature highly valued by users. Upcoming releases, such as Monday Service, are expected to attract further adoption and deepen existing client relationships, reflecting the platform’s continued evolution and Monday’s capacity to respond to shifting market demands. Financially, Monday has been making impressive strides in margin expansion. The company maintained a gross margin of 90% last quarter, surpassing its long-term target. Operating and net margins have also grown, although they recently plateaued as Monday increased R&D spending. This slight dip, however, is viewed positively as it reflects investment in new product development, which aligns with the company’s long-term growth objectives. Ultimately, Monday.com’s robust performance and sustained innovation affirm its premium valuation and status as a leader in the SaaS market. While the recent stock drop highlights market volatility, it does not reflect any fundamental issues with the business, making this an intriguing entry point for long-term investors. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 43 hedge fund portfolios held MNDY at the end of the second quarter which was 46 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of MNDY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MNDY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Gold Loses Some Luster After Trump’s Decisive Win

(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s victory immediately buoyed markets from stocks to Bitcoin. Gold is going to take a lot longer to turn things around. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions In the two days immediately following the Republican candidate’s win, the precious metal’s performance was the worst in at least 13 US presidential election windows, according to Deutsche Bank. Gold prices have dropped almost 7% since Election Day, even as several other asset classes enjoy a post-campaign boost. “When people get really interested in gold is when nothing else is working,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank. “Equities are working well; you’re even seeing solid returns for low-quality corporate credit. So you’re less likely to seek out alternative sources of portfolio growth.” Related: Your Guide to Trump’s Day-One Agenda, From Taxes to Tariffs Gold’s slide is a marked turnaround for a commodity that had surged by more than 30% in the year leading up to the US vote, hitting record after record as geopolitical and economic risk drew investors in. Although longer-term uncertainty remains in place, with Trump known for his at-times wildcard positions, much of gold’s safe-haven appeal apparated after the most bullish scenario for gold — a contested election — failed to materialize. A rallying dollar in the days since Trump’s re-election is also negative for bullion as it’s priced in the US currency. At the same time, the US economy appears to be in pretty good shape, with inflation easing and the Federal Reserve not in a rush to keep lowering interest rates. With the rest of the US economy looking so strong right now, “gold would be a contrarian call,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “The sentiment right now is there’s very little risk, whether it’s fundamentally, geopolitically. These types of environments, it’s not easy to go against momentum.” Some investors may not personally agree with the President-elect’s platform, but just knowing what to expect during Trump 2.0 has helped remove some of the recent uncertainty that helped propel the precious metal to new highs. The confirmation of a Republican clean sweep also means there’ll be more leeway to carry out the policies he telegraphed on the campaign trail. Trump’s agenda, ranging from tax cuts to financial deregulation to tariffs, has hedge funds piling into sectors that could benefit, including large-cap banks and domestic industrials. “We just have more compelling places to put capital” than gold, said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, citing opportunities in financials and other riskier assets. “Who wants to miss the 10% rally in Goldman Sachs?” Cryptocurrencies have also surged since Election Day amid expectations that Trump’s policies will boost digital assets. Total assets of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, BlackRock Inc.’s spot-Bitcoin ETF, surpassed $40 billion for the first time this past week. That surge coincided with a sharp outflow in SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest physically-backed gold ETF. “With a Trump win, one key implication is that we’re likely to see less regulation on cryptocurrencies. That should pull at least some capital away from gold; that pocket of demand that’s speculative may very well move to cryptos now,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco Advisers. Still, gold may still have some room to run longer term. Trump’s hardline pledges on taxes and tariffs are likely to eventually result in higher deficits and inflation, which could trigger the return to buying gold as an inflationary hedge. If a second Trump term disrupts global trade and geopolitics, it may also prompt central banks such as those in China and Russia to continue to buy gold to diversify away from the dollar-reserve system. “A lot of reserve managers of ‘friends’ and ‘neutral-ish’ countries, they’re going to be a little bit more worried about a more erratic foreign policy and implications on the safety of their reserves,” said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. The current selloff is “a buy-the-dip story more than anything else,” he added. “After the sharp decline since the US elections, gold has entered a more affordable range.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek FedEx’s CEO Is Charting His Own Path—in the Smith Family’s Shadow Political Ads Can’t Buy the Presidency CEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump Martha Stewart’s Empire Monetized More Than Just Domesticity Elon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump’s Government ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stands against the other department store stocks. With the holiday season approaching, discussions and concerns about expected consumer spending are increasing. According to Deloitte's annual holiday survey, shoppers are feeling more optimistic despite concerns about inflation, and are planning to increase their holiday spending by 8% year over year. On October 19, Brian McCarthy, Principal of Retail Strategy and Transformation at Deloitte, joined Brad Smith on Yahoo Finance's Wealth! to discuss what he calls an expected record-breaking shopping season. As per Deloitte's latest holiday retail survey, consumers are planning to spend more money in this year's holiday season, primarily due to a "rosier economic outlook." He says that we are seeing a 9 percentage point increase in positivity towards the economy's future. In addition, the overall consumer perception of higher prices is also a factor, with around 70% of shoppers believing that their prices for gifts in 2024 will be higher than in 2023. Retail executives are also optimistic about the upcoming season, with 80% expecting to see stronger sales both online and in brick-and-mortar. As per the survey, consumers plan to spend a record-high average of around $1,778 this year, with the average consumer spending experiencing an 8% increase from the 2023 survey. These trends are expected to emerge despite the inflationary and price pressures that some consumers have cited. McCarthy told Yahoo Finance: "We're seeing after this year of frugality and restraint, consumers are feeling a bit more optimistic about the economy. They're planning to have a very festive holiday season." An interesting brand loyalty crisis is also emerging this holiday season. Consumers are looking for better prices and deals instead of going back to the brands they always shop at. They are looking for the best value and are generally inching away from brand loyalty, prioritizing quality and price over brand names and tags. According to McCarthy, consumers seek quality, value, and variety when they go holiday shopping. He says that: "With the perception of higher prices still top of mind, consumers are really caught between trying to stretch their wallets and being festive and so this really means they're torn between seeking value and remaining loyal." He further says that around two-thirds of consumers are expected to switch brands if they find the price too high, and around 50% are willing to switch retailers to save. In addition, 78% of shoppers plan to participate in promotional events this October and November. Trends also show that privately labeled brand sales are expected to grow faster than national brand sales this year. He suggests that retailers must ensure that they provide good quality, good value price points, and a variety of selection that attracts consumers. He also offers advice to consumers looking to save some dollars without slashing items from their holiday list, saying that: "Shoppers are encouraged to explore multiple retailers to look for a competitive deal or a price point that they think is going to work for them." He adds, "I have found AI is a really interesting thing to start asking for where you may find particular products or promotional deals so you can use technology to be a bit more savvy that way. We recently published an article on the 10 Cheap Retail Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Here is an excerpt from the article: "According to the WTW Global Retail Survey for 2024, around 52% of retailers this year expect increased profitability in the coming two years. In addition, approximately 48% of retailers are looking to leverage artificial intelligence in their operations to offer their customers a personalized and efficient shopping experience. However, with more and more businesses turning towards AI, around 43% of the respondents voiced concerns about high cybersecurity risks likely to arise with increasing reliance on new technologies. Despite the risks, a majority of retailers are incorporating AI into their operations, streamlining and expediting their functioning". Our Methodology To compile a list of the 7 best department store stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we consulted the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screener to compile a list of the top 15 department store stocks. We then choose the top 7 stocks with the most number of hedge funds. The list of the 7 best department store stocks to buy according to hedge funds is arranged in ascending order of number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024.

Title: What happened in crypto this week
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/what-happened-in-crypto-this-week-4/
Time Published: 2024-11-16T23:16:22Z
Full Content:
What a week it’s been with the crypto market: Bitcoin hits $93,000, FTX sues Binance and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for $1.76 billion, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, investors withdraw appeal in Dogecoin lawsuit against Elon Musk, and ‘Crypto Dad’ denies interest in becoming SEC chair. Let’s look at these and recap what happened this week in crypto. Bitcoin reached a record $93,000 earlier this week, partly due to Donald Trump’s victory in the US election at the beginning of November. At the beginning of the week, Bitcoin broke the $82,000 mark before pushing to $84,000 and then $87,000. While Trump’s win has helped push Bitcoin to new heights given his pro-crypto stance during his campaign that isn’t the sole reason behind the recent bull run. According to Jesse Myers, co-founder of Onramp Bitcoin, the main reason is that the crypto market is at the “6+ months post-halving mark.” In Myers’ opinion, “supply shock has accumulated,” meaning “there’s not enough supply available at current prices to satisfy demand,” adding that a “supply-demand price equilibrium must be restored.” Earlier this month, James Toldeano, COO of self-custody wallet Unity, said it was “disingenuous” to say that the US election results directly caused Bitcoin’s price rise. With Bitcoin reaching new heights, Matthew Sigel, head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, forecasted that the current Bitcoin rally is in its early phases. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance and Changpeng Zhao over an alleged fraudulent transfer. According to a November 10 filing, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s former co-founder and CEO, fraudulently transferred “at least $1.76 billion” to Binance and Binance executives in July 2021. In 2019, Binance acquired a 20% stake in FTX and in 2020, Binance acquired a further 18.4% in WRS, an umbrella company of Bankman-Fried based in the US. However, in July 2021, the two exchanges agreed on a deal that saw FTX buying back Binance and its executives’ entire stakes in FTX and WRS. This amounted to around $1.76 billion in FTX’s FTT token, BNB, and BUSD (Binance’s stablecoin) The filing states that the transfer was fraudulent because Alameda Research – FTX’s sister company, which funded the transfer – was insolvent at the time and couldn’t afford it. According to testimony from Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, Alameda spent around “$1 billion of FTX Trading’s capital received from depositors to fund the repurchase.” BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hit a new record this week. In 211 days, it reached $40 billion in net assets. The record comes two weeks after it reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. With BlackRock’s new achievement, it’s surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas added that “[BlackRock’s] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.” At the time of publishing, BlackRock holds more than 471,000 Bitcoin, valued at $42.8 billion, according to data from iShares. Investors who’d sued Elon Musk and his company Tesla for manipulating the cryptocurrency Dogecoin earlier this week withdrew their appeal. Filed by Dogecoin investors, the lawsuit, claimed that Musk had used his influential public platform to artificially inflate the price of Dogecoin for personal gain. As evidence of a pattern of market manipulation, the investors pointed to Musk’s tweets and public appearances. However, according to US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein – who dismissed the case – the investors couldn’t establish claims of securities fraud based solely on Musk’s public statements. The judge stated that Musk claiming Dogecoin was the “future currency of Earth” or could be “floated to the moon” by SpaceX were not credible grounds for claims of insider trading or fraud. Christopher Giancarlo, former CFTC chair, and known as ‘Crypto Dad’ has denied rumors that he’s being considered to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a post on X, Giancarlo, known as Crypto Dad, said: “I’ve made clear that I’ve already cleaned up [an] earlier Gary Gensler mess @CFTC and don’t want to have [to] do it again,” adding: “DC rumors that I’m interested in some #crypto role @USTreasury are also wrong.” Giancarlo served as a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) between 2014 and 2019. In January 2017, he was designated as acting chair of the CFTC and in August 2017 he was confirmed to serve as the chair until 2019. Speculation over the future head of the SEC comes as Donald Trump promised to remove Gensler following his re-election to the White House earlier this month. Other possibilities for the role include Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, and Mark Uyeda, a current SEC commissioner.

The bulk of this money, nearly $5 billion, will be raised through sovereign funds in the Middle East. The funding will be used to purchase 100,000 NVIDIA chips, according to the news outlet. xAI plans to build a supercomputer with these chips. This supercomputer would then be integrated with other Musk companies, most notably Tesla, as plans to improve Full Self Driving continue at a rapid pace.

CNBC claims that the billionaire has started working closely with Donald Trump, the president-elect, on the approach of the new White House administration to AI and tech more broadly.

The technology world has been dealing with the impact of a change in the US presidency, as Trump is widely expected to increase tariffs on firms doing business with China. He is also expected to urge tech firms in the country to relocate manufacturing operations from overseas to the US.

Vigorous Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is more bullish than ever about the price of the premier cryptocurrency now that President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January. Saylor plans to have a New Year’s Eve party when BTC reaches the long-awaited $100,000 mark, which he expects by the end of this year. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor forecasted that Bitcoin would hit the coveted $100,000 at some point in December. “The red wave is probably the biggest thing that’s happened in the past four years for Bitcoin,” Saylor opined. “But we’re also getting a lot of very constructive support from Wall Street. BlackRock has been a very, very strong voice articulating the Bitcoin value proposition.” The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed post-Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6. The win heralds a potentially softer approach from regulators toward the crypto industry. Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet and to fire current SEC chair Gary Gensler on day one of office. Soon, we’ll see whether and how he’ll deliver on those promises. Nevertheless, Saylor believes the President-elect is “incredibly auspicious for Bitcoin” and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. “I think this is incredibly bullish for digital assets. It’s very good for the crypto industry. We’re going to see a lot more pro-Bitcoin policies. We’re going to see a digital assets framework. We’re going to see an end to the war on crypto. We’re going to see a lot of pro-business policies. I think that, clearly, the SEC will be a big part of it,” he continued. As of press time, one Bitcoin was worth $90,836 after hitting around $93,500 on Wednesday, as per data from CoinGecko. “I’m planning the $100K party,” Saylor opined. “I’m thinking it’s probably going to be New Year’s Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we don’t go through $100K in November or December.” Saylor ruled out the possibility of the benchmark crypto retracing to $60,000 or even as low as $30,000: “I don’t think it’s going to $60,000, it’s not going to $30,000. I think it is going to go up from here.” The MicroStrategy founder believes Trump winning the presidency has “very decidedly” determined the future of crypto in the U.S., adding, “I don’t really see any threats on the near-term horizon.”
