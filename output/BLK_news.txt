Getty Images Bitcoin is the most widely traded and well-known type of cryptocurrency. Since it was first created back in 2009, the value of bitcoin has fluctuated, often wildly at times, as awareness and interest in the digital currency shifts. Over the last decade, bitcoin's value has experienced significant volatility with large gains followed by precipitous declines. In 2017, bitcoin surged from around $1,000 in January to nearly $20,000 by December of that year. In 2018, bitcoin went the other way, with prices dropping below $4,000. 2020 was another wild swing, with value ranging from $7,000 to over $28,000 by the end of the year. The momentum continued into 2021, with bitcoin reaching a peak of $69,000 in November. Then, in 2022, the value of bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, dropped significantly during a period that is known as the crypto winter. At the time, bitcoin's price fell below $20,000 by the end of the year. However, 2023 marked a turnaround, with bitcoin closing the year at just over $42,000. 2024 has been a landmark year for Bitcoin, with several key events driving its price to new heights. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave regulatory approval for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds, including spot bitcoin ETFs. By March, bitcoin was trading at around $70,000. There was also a bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which also increased interest and value. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin's valuation was around $68,000 in Oct. 2024. After the election, bitcoin has been on a bull-run, reaching new highs almost daily. On Nov. 13, 2024, bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $90,000, providing a lofty market capitalization of approximately $1.8 trillion USD. The Nov. 2024 surge in bitcoin's value can be attributed to several factors, each playing a crucial role in driving the cryptocurrency to new heights. However, the single biggest individual driver is the victory of President Trump in the U.S. general election on Nov. 4. Donald Trump's election victory has been a significant spark for bitcoin's price explosion. During the election campaign, at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump pledged to make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the planet." At the same event, Trump promised that if he was elected, he would appoint a cryptocurrency-friendly chairperson to the SEC. The idea under a Trump Administration is that there would be less regulation to limit cryptocurrency as well as more favorable policies put in place to support usage and adoption. As part of ensuring more cryptocurrency friendly policies are in place, Trump has also proposed creating a bitcoin and cryptocurrency presidential advisory council. The council will include individuals that are in favor of cryptocurrency. Going a step further, Trump has also stated that he would not allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to create its own digital currency. The pro-cryptocurrency stance and overall rhetoric coming from Trump has provided renewed confidence and exuberance to the price of bitcoin. The Trump win also led to an overall spike across U.S. stock markets in the days following the election. The Trump win provided additional momentum for bitcoin, on top of a series of other factors. In Jan. 2024, the SEC first allowed the creation of spot bitcoin ETFs. The Trump victory made those ETFs more popular with large inflows of new investor capital. On Nov. 11 and 12, bitcoin ETFs recorded the largest volume of capital inflows, since the ETF were first allowed in January. Approximately $2 billion of capital flowed into bitcoin ETF on those two days alone. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust is one of the biggest recipients of inflows with over $40 billion since the fund was created and is larger than any other ETF launched in the past decade. It is expected that overall the tech industry will see less regulation under a Trump administration. The process of deregulation could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency. Even the talk of deregulation has already played a part in the price gains for bitcoin in November. The prospect of deregulation under Trump's presidency has already driven bitcoin to record highs above $90,000, reflecting market optimism about a cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment As part of his campaign platform, Trump signaled plans to reduce regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. Less regulation could mean more opportunities for cryptocurrency because there will be fewer restrictions. Trump's specific regulatory promises include the following: Another part of the Trump agenda that is helping to push bitcoin to all-time high price levels is the issue of taxes. There are several elements of the Trump agenda that will lower taxes and make cryptocurrency investing even more attractive to investors. Some of the proposed tax changes and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market include the following: When bitcoin started, it wasn't easy for the average retail investor to get involved. That's no longer the case. As more individuals become comfortable with digital assets, the user base for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to expand, driving up demand and prices. There are now multiple ways for retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency to gain in value. Multiple other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Solana and even Dogecoin have all had big gains. The following table shows some of the gains: The outlook for cryptocurrency appears to be mostly optimistic, albeit with some uncertainties. Trump's pro-cryptocurrency agenda, including plans to establish a national bitcoin reserve, support U.S.-based mining and prevent the development of a central bank digital currency, could boost the cryptocurrency market. His promise to make the U.S. the "crypto capital" of the world might attract global innovators and investors. While the short-term market response has been positive, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seeing significant gains, the long-term impact will depend on the actual implementation of these policies and broader economic factors. The implementation timeline for Trump's policies is uncertain. While the U.S. is an important market, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, which could impact the U.S. market regardless of domestic policies.

Title: Wall Street ponders a potential debt reckoning from Trump spending plans: Morning Brief

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Now that Donald Trump has been elected to a second term as president, investors have had to reckon with paradigm shifts to their positioning, from tariffs to “DOGE.” There’s also the bogeyman of the ballooning debt that the US will take on if Trump enacts his campaign promises. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s plans will boost the debt by $7.75 trillion. While that’s not a "today problem" for investors, they're still grappling with what that increase could mean down the road. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock, told me at the Yahoo Invest conference this week. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and then obviously inflation relative to that.” Rieder laid out a scenario where “bond vigilantes” could attack. Essentially, if regular buyers of government Treasurys decide that Trump’s fiscal policies are inflationary, they could stage a strike, or sell en masse, driving up yields. That, in turn, would increase debt servicing costs for the US government and create a ripple effect throughout markets and the economy. Of course, US debt has been rising for years, and the federal government hasn’t had a surplus (with revenue exceeding spending) since the brief window between the end of the Clinton administration and the start of the George W. Bush administration. And markets have mostly looked the other way. John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer invoked Bill Gross’s famous “cleanest dirty shirt” comparison when explaining why: “The US stands out because of our accountability, our transparency, governance, and also our capability to innovate and the size of our economy,” he said in a recent interview. That said, Stoltzfus, like most market participants, says federal debt will become a problem … eventually. For now, it’s more a discussion point than an economic obstacle.

Photo Credit: X/ @Tether_to Tether is targeting businesses and governments as customers Tether Holdings Ltd., the world's largest digital asset company, is getting into the tokenisation of stocks, bonds, funds and commodities. The platform Hadron by Tether, launched Thursday, will allow users to convert assets into products ranging from stablecoins that are pegged to fiat to digital tokens backed by commodities or other forms of collateral. The British Virgin Islands-registered company is targeting businesses and governments as customers, Tether said in a statement. Turning assets into tokens can allow them to be traded quicker and at a lower cost. The assets can be traded on blockchains by transferring them from one cryptocurrency wallet to another. These potential advantages led Wall Street companies like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Franklin Templeton to offer tokensed money market and mutual funds over the past couple years. Stablecoins, a form of crypto token pegged to another asset, use reserves to support their value. They are integral to the way crypto markets operate, acting as a less volatile alternative for traders looking to swap between digital assets and to store their wealth. Tether's stablecoin USDT, which is pegged to the dollar and backed by Treasuries and other assets, currently has over $126.6 billion tokens in circulation. The tokenisation platform is the latest effort by Tether to expand beyond its core business. The firm announced last week that it completed the funding of its first crude oil transaction in the Middle East as part of a plan to become a lender in commodities trading. The closely-held company has been the center of controversy in the past. Tether has previously faced fines from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and settled with the New York Authority General surrounding allegations that it lied about its reserves in the past and made misleading statements. © 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri shares how to invest as ETF inflows soar to records ahead of a promising 2025

Investors have poured money into the market at an unprecedented pace since Donald Trump's victory, though a veteran investment chief believes there's much more than politics at play. Inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shattered the record set in 2021 with more than a month and a half to spare, according to asset management titan BlackRock. The world's largest ETF issuer recently noted that $77 billion went into ETFs in the week after the election, which had never happened before. That surge coincided with the S&P 500's best week of 2024. Markets were especially euphoric immediately after election day. An astounding $22.3 billion went into US ETFs last Wednesday, and BlackRock's uber-popular iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) had its most active day of trading and inflows since 2007 as small caps soared by 5.8%. However, BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri doesn't think President-elect Trump deserves all the credit for this astounding market rally. The chief investment and portfolio strategist, Americas noted in a recent interview that US stocks had several strong catalysts before Trump's win. "Obviously, there have been some pretty sharp movements over the course of the last week," Chaudhuri told Business Insider. "But even as we look back to the quarter before that or since the beginning of this year, I think there have been some very solid fundamentals that have underpinned this movement." Robust growth for the economy and corporate earnings are some of the most salient market drivers, as are lower interest rates and receding inflation, Chaudhuri said. End-of-year rallies are also very common, especially in strong years for the market, as Truist recently remarked. Another convincing explanation for this recent market momentum is that investors had reduced risk as uncertainty mounted ahead of the election before quickly changing course when they got clarity on the path forward sooner and more decisively than anticipated. "Investors bringing down their portfolio risk going into elections was perhaps one of the reasons that we have seen this pretty strong re-risking in markets, especially after we got the election results," Chaudhuri said. As the new year approaches, Chaudhuri is rather confident about the US economy, even though a few recent developments seem to have given the glass-half-empty camp some ammunition. GDP growth and job additions have slipped lately, though neither is a major cause for concern for Chaudhuri. The economy didn't expand as much as expected in the third quarter, but GDP still rose at a healthy clip of 2.8%. And a weak October jobs figure appears to be largely due to the severe weather events that disrupted thousands of workers. Besides, more modest growth is a sign that the economy isn't overheating, which is welcome news to the Federal Reserve in its quest to ease financial conditions without reviving inflation. Such moderations aren't giving Chaudhuri pause about the trajectory of the US economy. "It would be very normal for us to continue to see a further normalization in the labor market, given how strong the economy has already been, how high rates are," Chaudhuri said. The investment chief added: "We haven't really seen that job destruction taking place quite yet. You're still seeing wages rising; you're not seeing layoffs pick up in a meaningful manner." Corporate earnings growth is arguably the most compelling reason to stick with US stocks following what's been another outstanding performance this year. Profits jumped about 7% in the third quarter, which is well above the mid-single-digit figure that analysts were banking on. "One of the things that the equity market has done over and over again is continue to surprise us in terms of earnings growth," Chaudhuri said. "I think companies have continued to find very innovative ways to manage their expenses. They've found a way, especially given the spend on AI, the type of CapEx that's going into finding ways to make companies have more productivity." Two sectors with abnormally strong earnings prospects are financials and industrials, Chaudhuri said. These economically sensitive groups enjoyed some of the larger post-election pops as Wall Street puts its chips on sectors that should benefit from a hot economy. And although smaller stocks have been on a heater, Chaudhuri believes that large, undervalued companies are the better place to be, given their superior earnings setup. "For a longer period of time, large cap is where we think the earnings growth is going to continue to be higher and better," Chaudhuri said. While earnings may not be under the microscope like they were when interest rates were at their peak, they're still top of mind for Chaudhuri. Larger stocks often have better earnings than their smaller peers, and the investment chief thinks that the cream will eventually rise to the top. "This catch-up trade that's happening in small caps right now has a little bit of legs," Chaudhuri said. "I think that can continue, maybe 'til the end of this month or even the end of next month." Chaudhuri continued: "But for us to believe in sustained rallies in small caps, we would need to see earnings growth, and over 50% of the small-cap index still is not very profitable." Jump to

Title: Michael Saylor: “I’m Already Planning the $100K Bitcoin Party for New Year’s Eve at My House”
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/michael-saylor-im-already-planning-the-100k-bitcoin-party-for-new-years-eve-at-my-house/

On November 14, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), joined CNBC from the Caner Crypto, Digital Assets, and AI Infrastructure Conference in Miami. The discussion kicked off with CNBC host Morgan Brennan addressing the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, asking Saylor whether the rally was linked to the anticipation of how the new U.S. administration would impact crypto. Saylor immediately acknowledged that the recent shift in the political landscape, which he referred to as the “Red Wave,” has been a significant development for Bitcoin. He suggested that the change in political leadership was the most positive event for the cryptocurrency market in the past four years. According to Saylor, this shift, combined with supportive voices from Wall Street, notably BlackRock, has created a more favorable environment for Bitcoin’s value proposition. MicroStrategy recently announced a plan to raise $42 billion to purchase more Bitcoin, which he equates to acquiring every Bitcoin mined over the next three years at a price of $85,000 or more per coin. Saylor emphasized that this bold strategy reflects MicroStrategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin-focused investment thesis and demonstrates their confidence in the ongoing bullish market conditions. The conversation then turned to regulatory matters, particularly with regard to the new U.S. administration’s potential appointment of a new SEC Chair. Saylor highlighted that while Bitcoin is regulated as a commodity, other cryptocurrencies and crypto-related businesses, including MicroStrategy, fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. He noted that the appointment of a new SEC Chair is critical for shaping the future of digital assets regulation. Saylor expects the next SEC Chair to be more aligned with pro-Bitcoin and pro-business policies. He foresees a digital assets framework that would bring an end to what he described as a “war on crypto,” leading to more clarity in the regulatory landscape. He also mentioned that the broader political shift in the U.S., with the House, Senate, and White House all leaning towards pro-crypto policies, bodes well for the future of the industry. However, he refrained from speculating on specific names for the new SEC leadership. Addressing Bitcoin’s price movement, Saylor expressed confidence that the current rally is far from over. He dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could fall below key levels such as $60,000 or $30,000. Instead, he confidently stated that he expects Bitcoin to continue rising, with a potential to breach $100,000 before the end of the year. Saylor is already planning a celebratory event for when Bitcoin crosses this milestone, hinting at hosting a party on New Year’s Eve. When pressed on potential risks that could drive Bitcoin’s price lower, Saylor downplayed any significant threats. He indicated that the biggest uncertainty had already been resolved by the results of the November 5th elections. In his view, the political landscape is now settled, with strong support for digital assets from the newly elected officials. As a result, he sees no immediate risks that could derail Bitcoin’s current trajectory. The final topic of discussion revolved around the idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, which has been proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming. Saylor drew parallels between this initiative and historical acquisitions by the U.S., such as the purchase of Manhattan, the Louisiana Territory, California, and Alaska. He argued that just as these acquisitions expanded the U.S.’s influence in the physical world, acquiring Bitcoin would establish American dominance in cyberspace. Saylor views the concept of a Bitcoin reserve as a strategic move that would secure the United States’ control over the global financial system in the digital age. He argued that owning a significant portion of Bitcoin would enable the U.S. to maintain its position as a global economic leader. According to his calculations, adopting this strategy could potentially offset $16 trillion of the national debt, making it not only a strategic but also an economically sound decision.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The speculative frenzy around Bitcoin since Donald Trump’s US election victory is moderating both in the spot and derivatives markets.

The token later pared back some of its losses trading at $90,265 as of 12:11 p.m. in London. In the derivatives sector, K33 Research said the premium paid for CME-listed Bitcoin futures over the spot market price has declined. US-based institutional investors use the contracts to take positions on the original cryptocurrency. Figures from Amberdata indicate a 24-hour surge in open interest — or outstanding contracts — for bearish options with a strike price of $80,000. “Markets seems to be cooling down,” said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, adding that the narrowing of the futures premium “might have been a subtle hint of moderating risk profiles.” Trump’s Pledges Bitcoin has jumped about 30% since the US election on Nov. 5. in response to President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance. The digital asset is now viewed as one of a suite of so-called Trump trades, and speculators are wondering how much impetus the rally has left. Trump has pledged to create a friendly regulatory framework for crypto, set up a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and make the US the global hub for the industry. A onetime crypto skeptic, Trump changed tack after digital-asset firms spent heavily during election campaigning to promote their interests. Questions remain about the feasibility and implementation timeline of his promises. Investors poured a net $4.3 billion into US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds after Election Day. The 12 funds, from issuers including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, now have total assets of about $93 billion, based on figures compiled by Bloomberg. Volatility Expected “It’s all pure speculative trading right now,” said James Davies, chief executive officer at on-chain futures and options trading platform Crypto Valley Exchange. “Expect lots of volatility and a lack of clear signals for a while, whilst we wait for policy announcements in the US.” Davies flagged $90,000 as a key marker to watch to see if acts as a “resistance level, or if we are well past it.” One of the highest concentrations of bullish Bitcoin options bets is for the $100,000 strike, data from Deribit show. Bitcoin changed hands at $87,740 as of 6 a.m. Friday in London. Smaller tokens such as second-ranked Ether and meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin were mixed, in line with easing risk appetite as traders pared bets on Fed rate cuts following Powell’s comments. --With assistance from Dave Liedtka.

Title: Ireland v Argentina: Hosts must improve or fall prey to Pumas on a mission

A week can be a long time in rugby, and especially in November. Before Ireland’s opening Autumn Nations Series game against the All Blacks, there was almost blase expectations of another November clean sweep. Now, instead, that hope has been dashed and danger looms large over the horizon. After a first November home defeat since 2016, next up are Los Pumas, and the flip side of being the biggest gunslinger in town is that it makes you the most prized target. So, one imagines Felipe Contepomi had barely assembled his squad for their end-of-year tour than he had targeted a first ever Pumas win over Ireland in this ground. With Ireland in need of a win to avoid successive defeats for the first time since February 2021, there is more at stake than the Admiral Brown Cup, named after the Argentinian naval hero William (aka Guillermo) Brown, who was born in Foxford in Mayo in 1777. Contepomi loves Dublin and Ireland after leaving an indelible imprint in his eventful time with Leinster as a player and coach. He also had many great days against Ireland, not least in the 1999 and 2007 World Cups, as well as two home wins, but he lost against Ireland five times, including all four visits to Dublin. Whereas Argentina have beaten Les Bleus five times in France, England twice at Twickenham, and have won in Scotland four times and Wales three times, they have lost all 10 Tests in Dublin (11 including the 1973 visit). So, while much of the spite from the Noughties has gone from this rivalry and Los Pumas still have to play France in Paris next Friday, beating Ireland would be the cherry on top to a landmark year. Until 2016, when Ireland achieved the feat, only Martin Johnson’s vintage English team of 2003 had beaten the southern hemisphere big three in the same calendar year. Ireland repeated the feat in 2022 and now Los Pumas in 2024 can be added to that list. The return of Guido Petti, Pablo Matera and Matías Moroni, as well as of the gifted Santiago Carreras to the bench, is a statement of intent. Granted, performances have been inconsistent, but this is a very settled Pumas side. They beat Italy 50-18 in Udine last week. This is the same front-row that started their last five games. Tomas Albornoz has solved their outhalf conundrum, they’ve pace on the edges and the classy Juan Cruz Mallia is oozing confidence. They also have licence to, selectively, play from anywhere. Contepomi once started a contender for Leinster’s greatest ever try off turnover ball near his own line and last week Albornoz instigated and finished a pitch-length try in his 20-point haul. “He’s definitely gone back to their flair a little bit,” said Caelan Doris. “They’re playing with a lot more width. He [Contepomi] is a pretty creative guy. Some of the lineout plays that he came up with, with us [Leinster], were pretty inventive. He’s quite detail-orientated as well.” With Matera alongside Juan Martín González, a slightly younger version of Doris, and Joaquin Oviedo, their back row has a typical Pumas’ dynamism and their battle with Ireland’s loose forwards could be worth the admission money alone. “I’ve said to you guys before that I love playing against really good backrow players and tomorrow is another opportunity to do that,” said Doris after Ireland’s Captain’s Run in the UCD Bowl, where he remembers winning once with St Mary’s in the AIL. Doris is doing well to remember too, given his “debs” was later that night. “Oviedo at number eight has been class as well. He’s a bit of a balance between Matera and Gonzalez in that he’s got good footwork, he’s a good athlete and he’s also extremely powerful and has the ability to play at the line as well. “Gonzalez, I’m just struck watching him by his physicality, unbelievable pace and he pops up in wider channels quite a bit. Matera, I’ve played against him before and he has a lot of power, a lot of determination in his carry. A bit of a nuisance at the breakdown, all three of them are. I’m excited to test myself against them.” As for Andy Farrell, retaining all but one of his starting XV while reinvigorating the bench is a statement of faith, while promoting Ryan Baird alongside Peter O’Mahony on the bench increases Ireland’s lineout options. Improving discipline after Nic Berry’s costly 13-5 penalty count is paramount too. “I think nine of the 13 penalties were given away by forwards, and a lot of those were around the breakdown,” said Doris. “Yeah, cleaning our stuff up is the main thing.” Statistics and damned lies. Ireland have won 22 of their last 25 Tests, but they’ve lost three of their last five. The All Blacks took a leaf out of England’s and South Africa’s manual by having the majority of the possession, reducing Ireland’s oxygen from lineouts and the breakdown. Under Farrell, Ireland have achieved many landmarks by being a possession-based side. Generating quality lineout ball would infuse Ireland with a platform and confidence. The forecasted dryer conditions should help build more momentum through phases. Jamison Gibson-Park would then have the scope to probe the blindside as he does better than any “9″ and Jack Crowley would have more front-foot ball in more dangerous areas. Although an ever-present since the World Cup, the Munster outhalf is under pressure and looks a tad short in confidence, going through the moves but not trusting his instincts. But he’s still only 24. This is all part of his and the team’s renewed growth. Based on trust in this team, and just one week on, all that could change again. Ireland: Hugo Keenan (UCD/Leinster); Mack Hansen (Corinthians/Connacht), Garry Ringrose (UCD/Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Buccaneers/Leinster), James Lowe (Leinster); Jack Crowley (Cork Constitution/Munster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (UCD/Leinster), Rónan Kelleher (Lansdowne/Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Buccaneers/Connacht), Joe McCarthy (Dublin University/Leinster)(13), James Ryan (UCD/Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Lansdowne/Munster), Josh van der Flier (UCD/Leinster), Caelan Doris (St Mary’s College/Leinster, captain).

[singing] everybody must carve stone... “Cheating...” Fair enough. But the same could probably have been said with the introduction of any new technology to the field. The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo’s David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I’d imagine that there’ll be a market for that sort of thing. all the time or just rainy days? You miss the point. Reproductions/replicas are not art, they are copies. There’s a robotic bumbershoot that helps with that. Perfect counterfeits, and if from same quarry, who can tell? You miss the point. I never said that such things weren’t copies. Are you saying if I take a picture of the mona lisa or do a step by step “paint by numbers” copy - that’s it’s different than creating the original work of art? “The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard “cheater” from the guys just using hammers and chisels.” True... but at least he had to sculpt. He couldn’t go into town for a sandwich and let the power tools do it all. Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That’s not to say that AI-created designs wouldn’t also be possible. If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let’s keep raising that minimum wage! Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

Title: Microsoft UAE power deal at centre of US plan for AI supremacy
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366615892/Microsoft-UAE-power-deal-at-centre-of-US-plan-for-AI-supremacy
Time Published: 2024-11-15T05:08:00Z
Full Content:
VLRS - stock.adobe.com Microsoft has struck an artificial intelligence (AI) energy deal with United Arab Emirates (UAE) oil giant ADNOC after a year of extraordinary diplomacy in which it was the vehicle for a US strategy to prevent a Chinese military tech grab in the Gulf region. The latest in a line of AI deals that Microsoft has struck in the UAE this year, it is the fruit of a strategic partnership the US struck with the Gulf state in September to entwine the UAE with US strategic interests and technology, after it started investing its oil wealth in a plan to become an AI superpower. It also entrenches Microsoft’s place at the crux of the environmental crisis, pledging to help one of the world’s largest oil firms use AI to become a net-zero producer of carbon emissions, while getting help in return in building renewable energy sources to feed the unprecedented demand that the datacentres powering its AI services have for electricity. The same paradox was played out at the COP 28 climate conference in Dubai last December, while Microsoft prepared to ink a $1.5bn investment in UAE state-owned AI and datacentre conglomerate G42, where Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, ADNOC oil chief, chaired a global agreement to ditch fossil fuels. But the agreement raises a question of why Microsoft needs the partnership to explore the potential for renewables to power AI, when a considerable proportion of electricity required to run the power-hungry computers in the world’s datacentres already comes from renewable sources. This came after massive investments by US big tech firms, and when a third party in the deal is Masdar, the renewables arm of a UEA sovereign wealth fund, set up to invest the state’s oil wealth in renewables. This helped the Gulf state attain a similar place in the world’s top 10 rankings for solar power output as it has in oil production. Masdar’s investments include the UK’s Dogger Bank wind farm, set to become the world’s largest. It is a crucial question for UAE, which has established its credentials in making some of the most notable breakthroughs in AI tech in recent years. This includes the Falcon large language model, which is compared for its acumen with well-known AI engines operated by US big tech firms, and is the world’s first Arabic AI model. The petrostate seeks to be a world leader in AI, while the global energy transition strips it of the oil and gas wealth upon which its economy was until recently almost entirely dependent. Al Jaber, who is also UAE industry minister, characterised these last weeks as a crisis, worsened by an anticipated population surge across the southern hemisphere, and by the unexpected and exponential growth in demand for power from datacentres housing AI computer systems. It is a crucial matter for UAE because the weather in the Middle East is so hot that it takes 50% more energy to cool a datacentre there than in the cooler northern reaches where most datacentres operate, according to Tassos Peppas, regional director of Vertiv, a supplier of datacentre power and cooling systems crucial for running the prized Nvidia computer chips crucial for the big AI systems. “The Middle East is not the best place for energy efficiency,” he said. No matter that energy in the Gulf was typically 90% cheaper than Europe, and that the same datacentre, on balance, would cost up to 80% less than one in Europe. Unanticipated until 18 months ago, the UAE has now called for a boost in all forms of cleaner energy, including the liquid natural gas to which the country has turned to as a less-polluting fossil fuel export than the oil, which is still a primary source of power across those countries where populations are booming and economies are industrialising fast, Al Jaber told a global conference of oil and energy chiefs, and state officials from across the southern hemisphere. Those countries, across Africa, Southeast and Central Asia, and the Asian subcontinent, where UAE has a long tradition of trade, have become a destination for Emirate investments in AI, energy and port infrastructure. The firms Microsoft has been doing business with have all been spreading their influence by making such AI investments across the wider region. Microsoft itself did a $1bn AI deal with the UAE in Kenya in May. That explains both Microsoft and US motives in the Gulf state, as UAE AI minister Omar Sultan Al Olama put it in an interview with US think tank Atlantic Council when the software giant took its massive stake in G42 in in April. UAE is a “gateway” to Africa, Southeast Asia and India. He likened great power competition in AI, and international negotiations over AI regulation such as the UK’s own Bletchley Park summit, to the Cold War nuclear arms race. “UAE is the perfect hub where the US can showcase its technology for the rest of the developing world in a way that asserts its supremacy in this domain,” he said. UAE’s Falcon AI was a vehicle the US could use to assert that supremacy, because it was known and trusted in Africa, for example, while Falcon would benefit from getting access to advanced US AI technology. That trade-off came at the expense last year of G42 purging its systems and datacentres of Chinese technology, paving the way for a strategic deal with the US two months ago, and a series of tie-ups. These included a $100bn investment fund that Microsoft formed with US financial giants BlackRock and Global Infrastructure Partners, and UAE state-owned AI investor MGX. Microsoft president Brad Smith joined UN environment envoy Mark Carney and the CEOs of most major oil firms to agree on the eve of the energy conference that the crisis was so great that it would need gas, as well as nuclear and renewables, to solve it. The software giant’s latest contribution will be the AI engine for a UAE effort to make its fossil gas exports more competitive, as well as its energy system greener. Microsoft will help run a national infrastructure of energy grid battery plants UAE needs to store output from what it claims is the world’s largest solar farm, as it completes construction in the next five years. Al Jaber, sitting on the boards of most of the firms involved, as well as running the industry ministry, and Microsoft’s Smith, will be at the centre of it all.

Hadron lets users tokenize various assets, from stocks and bonds to stablecoins and loyalty points, Tether said Thursday in a statement. The platform also offers tools for issuing and managing the full life cycle of digital tokenized assets, with the aim of facilitating the process of tokenizing assets for both individual and institutional investors, according to the company. Real-world asset tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights of physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain. The tokens represent fractional or full ownership of the asset, allowing it to be bought, sold, or traded more easily in digital markets while providing increased liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. “Traditional finance institutions have always pushed for closed ecosystems that are opaque to citizens,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in the statement. “By leveraging all of Tether’s technology—which today has already secured 125 billion dollars—we’re making asset tokenization easier, secure, and scalable.” Hadron supports tokenizing digital securities such as equities, bonds, and funds; fiat-pegged and commodity-backed stablecoins; and Alloy by Tethered Assets assets. Tethered Assets are designed to track a reference asset’s price "through stabilization strategies," including over-collateralization with "liquid assets and secondary market liquidity pools," per Tether's website. The company also plans to offer tokenization for digital asset-collateralized tokens, including basket-collateralized products. Currently serving several institutions in beta, the platform's team is also in discussions to work with several developing nation-states, a Tether representative told Decrypt. The Tether-linked platform operates with asset issuance and burning and capital market management, in addition to abiding by Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines and other regulatory requirements, the company said in a statement. Hadron’s launch comes amid a surge in real-world asset tokenization. RWA's total value locked stands at $6.591 billion, which is up roughly 12% since the same time last year, DeFiLlama data shows. Hadron is just one of several crypto-native players attempting to get a piece of the RWA pie. In early October, Midas launched two tokenized investment products based on mTBill and mBasis, respectively. Meanwhile, Elmnts, a tokenized investment platform for funds backed by mineral rights royalties, launched on Solana later that month. DeFi protocol Ondo also started leveraging the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) tokenized money market fund for its derivative products earlier this year.

Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news/personal-finance Musk took to his social media platform to voice his opinion on the recent surges Elon Musk, well-known for his influential voice in the tech and crypto world, has again sparked interest by revisiting his stance on digital currencies. This latest move comes during a remarkable surge in the cryptocurrency market, with bitcoin surging past $90,000 and drawing attention with its rapid ascent. The market's sharp rise follows the recent U.S. presidential election outcome, where Donald Trump secured victory, adding further anticipation for potential policy changes favorable to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, riding a wave of optimism, has climbed 20% in just a week, pushing the combined crypto market back over the $3 trillion mark for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, dogecoin, a cryptocurrency Musk has historically backed, has also rallied to levels reminiscent of the 2021 crypto boom. In an unexpected twist, Musk voiced his support for dogecoin's inflationary design. Responding to Billy Markus, dogecoin's co-creator, who engaged the community on the topic, Musk affirmed his belief in the system. "I think the flat inflation of dogecoin, which means decreasing percentage inflation, is a feature, not a bug," Musk noted on X, reigniting interest in the meme-based currency. Dogecoin, originally forked from bitcoin's code, stands out for its limitless supply, differing from bitcoin's cap of 21 million coins. This characteristic has long sparked debate, with some advocating for inflation as a tool for usability and circulation. Markus reinforced this view, pointing out that the currency's steady, predictable inflation is lower than that of the dollar, emphasizing its potential for real-world currency use. Musk's comments come amid heightened speculation that BlackRock is preparing to double down on bitcoin investments, signaling a potential shift in how major financial institutions engage with cryptocurrencies. Tesla and SpaceX, Musk's prominent ventures, already accept dogecoin for certain transactions, showcasing Musk's continued commitment to the meme-driven currency. This public endorsement, however, has not been without challenges. Musk faced legal battles when his past crypto endorsements led to accusations of market manipulation. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed a high-profile lawsuit accusing Musk and Tesla of artificially inflating the value of dogecoin in a so-called $258 billion "pyramid scheme." The market surge follows Trump's administration hinting at significant changes to crypto regulations, with experts forecasting more lenient approaches and potential leadership shifts at regulatory bodies known for their cautious stance on digital assets. Adding fuel to the speculative fire, Trump has floated the idea of a U.S. bitcoin reserve, drawing comparisons to gold and suggesting bitcoin could be an asset to address the country's colossal debt. As the U.S. gears up for a potential shift in crypto policy and the market adjusts to the latest developments, all eyes remain on key players like Musk, whose words can sway billions in market value, and on the administration that could pave the way for the future of digital currency in the global financial system. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

OpenAI’s reported proposal for special economic districts across America could unleash billions in private investment and dramatically accelerate domestic tech infrastructure, marking Silicon Valley’s boldest push yet to reshape how artificial intelligence (AI) technology gets built, analysts say. The proposal would establish government-backed zones offering streamlined permitting for data centers and chip plants while providing tax incentives to AI companies. It’s a part of OpenAI’s strategy to accelerate America’s AI capabilities amid intensifying global competition for technological dominance. “With dedicated zones, companies would likely choose locations based on these areas’ infrastructure, regulatory flexibility, and AI-focused incentives and resources,” Maxim Manturov, head of investment research at stock brokerage Freedom24, told PYMNTS. “To attract companies, these AI economic zones might have to offer incentives like tax breaks, grants or funding. Such incentives could help offset initial costs, making it more appealing for companies to grow their roots in those areas.” OpenAI’s proposal for special economic districts could impact commerce by channeling billions of private investments into AI infrastructure and attracting tech companies with generous incentives. Analysts suggest this move could accelerate innovation, reshaping the landscape for data centers, chip plants, and AI-driven businesses across the U.S. According to FedScoop, OpenAI plans to present a policy blueprint advocating for AI economic zones across the U.S. through state and federal collaboration. The proposal, set to be unveiled in Washington, outlines plans to streamline the construction of energy systems and data centers powering AI development. The blueprint reportedly calls for a National Transmission Highway Act targeting power transmission and fiber networks while proposing a North American AI compact to compete with China. The initiative, which emerges as the Biden administration pushes for increased AI infrastructure support, includes recommendations for leveraging Navy nuclear resources and developing the workforce for AI-related operations. Recent proposals in the U.S. to boost AI development include the Biden administration’s $140 million investment to establish National AI Research Institutes to promote responsible AI research. In addition, Microsoft has partnered with BlackRock to build AI-specific data centers that use advanced energy infrastructure, addressing the need for sustainable power to fuel AI advancements. The CHIPS and Science Act also includes provisions to enhance domestic semiconductor manufacturing, a critical component for AI development. Additionally, Nvidia and ServiceNow announced plans to collaborate on developing generative AI tools, illustrating private-sector initiatives to advance AI. “AI-empowered free zones would most certainly attract tech firms and startups, resulting in firms’ relocation decisions in these zones for the benefit of both resources and community,” Cache Merrill, founder of Zibtek and technology strategist, told PYMNTS. “This regional emphasis could provide for additional scattering of tech clusters in the U.S., reducing dependence on the already established tech centers and in all likelihood, creating opportunities in new cities in the suburbs.” Merrill said financial incentives in these zones may include reduced taxes, lowered compliance costs, and assistance in investing in AI R&D. He added that the plan would support workforce development programs to incentivize companies to invest in local talent training. This would benefit regional economies and create a skilled workforce pipeline for AI operations. “Another benefit of the economic zones of AI is that they could promote private firms and large public universities to work together for R&D purposes,” Merrill said. “These collaborations would be very effective in AI technology transfer, because universities are the foremost providers of basic science, while business firms are the best providers of AI applications. Such zones may facilitate collaboration on joint research laboratories, joint funding of practicum, and joint transnational corporation projects on technology acquisition.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Fiat Everything: When Decree Replaced Reality

Time Published: 2024-11-14T22:09:15Z

November 14, 2024 By Josh Stylman We live in a world where every essential human need—money, food, health, education, and even information—is controlled and manipulated by artificial systems. This matrix of artifice began with central bankers creating fiat currency: declaring something’s value, enforcing its use, and creating dependency. This template manufactured scarcity where none naturally exists, ensuring reliance on their systems. We see this pattern everywhere: money created from nothing yet always in short supply, abundant food made artificially scarce, natural healing rebranded as ‘alternative,’ wisdom replaced by credentials. The Federal Reserve conjures currency through debt monetization, each new dollar stealing value from every existing one. Through inflation, they silently rob almost all of your savings, turning your productive energy into their power. In 1913, a solid month’s work could buy a fine suit. Today it barely covers a week’s groceries. The labor didn’t change—the money did. Fiat currency itself is a kind of enforced dependency. Since the gold standard was abandoned in 1971, there has been no limit on their monetary manipulation. This isn’t just about currency—it’s about energy harvesting. Banks create money through keystrokes, then demand repayment in real human time and labor. When the Fed printed $6 trillion in 2020, they didn’t create value—they diluted every dollar in your savings account. It’s modern financial alchemy: transforming your productivity into their power. As Brownstone’s Jeffrey Tucker aptly puts it, ‘The Federal Reserve is the engine of one of the most sophisticated forms of theft in the history of mankind.’ As central banks race to implement Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), promising convenience while building the architecture for total financial surveillance, the endgame becomes clear. Hard money—constrained by natural or mathematical limits—can’t be summoned into existence. Gold and silver face physical extraction constraints. Bitcoin is hard-capped at 21 million coins. Land cannot be added to the map. Even these aren’t perfect, but they share one critical feature: they cannot be created like monopoly money by central planners. These limitations mean true value is earned, not fabricated, which is why they’re attacked—they can’t be inflated away. Just as the financial system shapes our economic reality through artificial scarcity, the information landscape engineers our perception through concentrated control. Six corporations control 90% of media outlets, down from 50 companies in 1983. Further exacerbating this consolidation, it’s not about false stories—it’s about manufacturing false reality and engineering social division. Fiat currency has created a fiat news system, where the same principles apply: declare something, repeat it, enforce it, and it enters the consciousness of the masses. The illusion of media choice masks concentrated ownership: BlackRock and Vanguard are top shareholders in every major media company (incidentally, they own the major banks too). The same firms own shares in defense contractors, pharmaceutical companies, and the very corporations making headlines. As former CBS News president Richard Salant admitted, “Our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.” By slicing society into endless opposing camps—left vs right, black vs white, vaxxed vs unvaxxed—they ensure people keep fighting each other instead of looking up to see who’s pulling the strings. This isn’t simply about silencing dissent but shaping belief. Remember how quickly “Trust the science” became “Don’t question authority”? How “Two weeks to flatten the curve” became two years of shifting goalposts? Even the most trusting citizens began noticing the narrative management. The Information Factory doesn’t just control what you see—it shapes how you think about what you see. Content curation algorithms create echo chambers while coordinated messaging manufactures the illusion of consensus. Media outlets are owned by corporations dependent on government contracts and regulated by the agencies they report on. When you follow the money—from pharmaceutical ads to defense contractor ownership—you see that they’re not reporting on the system; they are the system. The manipulation of information serves as a precursor to perhaps the most devastating expression of centralized power—the machinery of endless war. War is the ultimate racket, and bankers have perfected it since the Napoleonic Wars. Create the conflict, fund all participants, profit from the destruction, and then finance the reconstruction. The same financial interests collect blood money regardless of who “wins.” The military-industrial complex needs endless enemies to justify endless spending. When one boogeyman falls, they manufacture another. They don’t sell weapons—they sell fear. Each missile launched represents schools not built, hospitals not funded, communities not supported. The people always pay, while bankers collect the dividends. They call it “foreign policy”—it’s really population control and resource theft. They destroy independent nations that dare create their own money systems or trade outside their control while calling it “spreading democracy.” Young people die in foreign lands while suit-wearing vultures redraw maps around oil fields and trade routes. Look at Ukraine: BlackRock is already planning the “reconstruction,” buying up land and resources while people die. While physical warfare destroys bodies, the credentialing system wages a quieter battle for minds, determining who can speak with authority and what truths are deemed acceptable. We’ve created a class of experts who mistake institutional approval for wisdom. The average medical student graduates with $241,600 in debt—how likely are they to challenge a system they’re indebted to? Fiat education produces fiat expertise, reliant on institutional validation instead of true understanding. Studies show that medical education frequently emphasizes pharmaceutical interventions, while lifestyle and dietary approaches receive comparatively little attention. When PhDs questioned lockdown policies, they were silenced while social media companies became overnight “public health experts. The student loan crisis reveals the scam: $1.7 trillion in debt while real wages for graduates have stagnated. Real expertise comes from results, not degrees. A farmer who grows nutrient-dense food understands health better than many nutritionists. A mechanic who fixes engines grasps complex systems better than many economists. Theory without practice is just sophisticated guessing. Their degrees don’t measure intelligence—they measure obedience. The longer you stay in their system, the harder it becomes to see beyond it. The same institutional capture that turns education into indoctrination extends into healthcare, where healing wisdom is replaced by patented interventions. They’ve transformed medicine from healing art to subscription service. Purdue Pharma made $35 billion selling OxyContin while calling addiction “pseudoaddiction” requiring higher doses. The FDA approves synthetic THC while natural plants are federally illegal, despite legalization in some states. The difference? One can be patented. Here again, fiat principles: replace the natural with the engineered, at a steep price. The corruption is measurable: The pharmaceutical industry has faced substantial financial penalties over the past two decades due to various legal violations. Among the most significant cases are: These same companies now claim exclusive authority over human health, hooking children on SSRIs instead of teaching them to process emotions naturally. Natural healing—through sunlight, clean food, movement, and rest—gets labeled “alternative” while synthetic drugs become standard care. Your body’s innate healing power becomes suspect while their patented molecules become essential. Our bodies know how to recover when we remove the obstacles. The medicalization of health represents just one front in a broader war against natural systems—one that extends to our most basic needs for nourishment. Look at their war on our most nutrient-dense traditional foods: They demonize meat and butter—the very foods that built our brains and sustained humanity for millennia. Dr. Weston Price’s extensive research of indigenous populations in the 1930s documented zero instances of modern chronic diseases among groups eating their traditional diets, finding rates of dental caries less than 1% and virtually no heart disease. Yet they push processed soy patties and lab-grown protein while attacking regenerative grazing that could heal our planet. Raw milk, nature’s perfect food, becomes “dangerous” the moment it leaves the cow. Despite regulatory opposition, demand has surged, with buying clubs and small farmers facing scrutiny and even armed raids for selling fresh milk. This once-simple food choice has turned political, embraced by those questioning government authority, while ultra-processed ‘milk alternatives’ made from water and seed oils flood supermarket shelves. Even the sun, the source of all life on Earth, has been turned into an enemy. Instead of teaching proper sun exposure for optimal vitamin D, they push chemical sunscreens that disrupt hormones and poison coral reefs. As our connection to natural systems is severed, we’re ushered into an artificial realm that promises connection while delivering isolation. The path to our current isolation was carefully engineered. First, they separated us physically—”Just stay 6 feet apart.” Then they confined us—”Just stay home.” Finally, they sold us the ultimate fiat substitute: the metaverse—where digital avatars replace human touch. Ironically, as social connection grows artificial, real human presence becomes rarer. As someone who spent two decades as a technologist, I know these tools are powerful and should be universally accessible to all. The issue isn’t technology itself—it’s whether it’s deployed to centralize or decentralize power. Like electricity, which can power a community or an electric fence, digital tools can either connect and empower people or surveil and control them. The question isn’t the technology—it’s who controls it and how it’s used. We’ve become alone together—constantly surrounded yet deeply alone. Meta’s own research shows Instagram makes body image issues worse for 32% of teen girls. Average screen time has skyrocketed to over 7 hours daily in 2023, while rates of depression doubled. We broadcast our lives to strangers while avoiding eye contact with neighbors. We share our deepest thoughts with algorithms while struggling to have real conversations. We’re drowning in communication while starving for communion. Yes, virtual worlds can be fun escapes—there’s joy in games and digital play. But the metaverse isn’t just entertainment—it’s an attempt to replace reality itself with an artificial construct they control. A thousand TikTok friends can’t replace one real conversation. A million likes can’t substitute for one genuine hug. We’re bioelectric beings who literally resonate with each other. Human proximity affects our: They fear real human connection because it breaks their control matrix. When people gather, share stories, and exchange energy, the programming breaks down. The implementation starts locally: If you live in an urban area, join or start a food-buying club. If you have access to farmers, buy directly from them. Create a neighborhood skill-sharing network where people teach what they know—from food preservation to basic repair skills. Start a community garden or join an existing CSA. Build relationships with like-minded neighbors. Each small step builds resilience and weakens dependency on artificial systems. The beautiful truth is that every artificial system has a natural counterpart that sets us free. Artificial systems rely on your participation, belief, and, ultimately, obedience. Their money only has value if we believe in it. Their authority only has power if we accept it. Their narratives only work if we consume them. The solution isn’t complex: No one returns to fiat systems once they’ve experienced the real thing. You don’t go back to processed food after tasting nature’s abundance. You don’t trust fiat currency once you understand sound money. You don’t accept artificial authority once you’ve found your own sovereignty. The revolution isn’t coming—it’s here. Every garden is a rebellion against their food system. Every bitcoin is a rebellion against their money system. Every real conversation is a rebellion against their control system. Every home cook is a rebellion against their processed food empire. Every parent teaching real history is a rebellion against their education system. Every local market is a rebellion against their corporate monopolies. Every neighborhood gathering is a rebellion against their isolation agenda. Our ancestors thrived without fiat systems. Our descendants will view this artificial era as a dark age of manufactured limitation. The transition back to natural law isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable. Truth doesn’t need enforcement. Reality doesn’t need decree. Your DNA remembers what your mind was programmed to forget. Freedom isn’t granted by authority—it’s your natural state. What real thing will you choose today?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News You Must Read Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves. Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell: Overtime’ to discuss the market’s reaction to the election results and earnings. According to Hickey, as the President-elect's cabinet takes shape, it will provide insight into what to expect moving forward. However, he notes that election results can be overstated. Over the past 16 years, we’ve had some "very good" market returns for Obama, Trump, and Biden, he notes. Looking ahead, Hickey suggests that the AI bull market is likely to persist, driven by momentum, and will likely only change course if influenced by a significant external force. READ ALSO: 10 AI Headlines Making Waves Today and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet Hickey’s remarks demonstrate how the market is resilient in adapting to different administrations. The current AI boom stands to be a case in point, where innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been attracting investors and consequently driven substantial capital inflows. Therefore, it is safe to say that companies harnessing AI for productivity gains, efficiency improvements, and new revenue streams have become the focal point of market optimism. As more industries integrate AI technology into their operations, the resulting growth potential could sustain the bull market for an extended period. With AI momentum showing no signs of slowing down, there seemingly isn’t anyone who doesn’t want to reap all the benefits that AI delivers. Every year, more than a thousand startups join Station F, an iconic startup in Paris. Station F selects the top 40 most promising startups from the pool of 1000, sharing a list of what it calls the “Future 40”. 34 of the 40 startups this year have been using artificial intelligence, implying the significance of the technology. Artificial intelligence is just as much a focal point nationally as it is at the local level. That said, OpenAI recently revealed its plans to work with the new administration on AI policy. Known as the official “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure”, it involves artificial intelligence economic zones, tapping the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power experience and government projects funded by private investors, notes CNBC. The blueprint also includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China’s initiatives and a National Transmission Highway Act “as ambitious as the 1956 National Interstate and Defense Highways Act.” As per OpenAI, investment in the US AI is going to result in tens of thousands of jobs, GDP growth, a modernized grid that includes nuclear power, a new group of chip manufacturing facilities, and billions of dollars in investment from global funds. While Trump plans on repealing Biden’s executive order on AI, OpenAI has, in turn, highlighted a plan of AI economic zones co-created by state and federal governments “to give states incentives to speed up permitting and approvals for AI infrastructure”, amongst other things. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: World of Warcraft's in-game anniversary event could've been a joyous celebration of the last 20 years, but instead it's a disappointing grind

The anniversary event is full of sound and fury, thus far signifying no thing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The 20th anniversary of World of Warcraft deserves an epic event: a celebration of the world's most successful MMO, one that has transcended generations. Instead, it's a jumbled mess of nostalgia with no clear throughline and a grind to earn anything fun. Let me start by announcing my bias: I adore Warcraft. I've been writing about it since six months before the game's release, and despite its many flaws, I've largely stuck with it nearly continuously since then. I was absolutely looking forward to the celebration of the anniversary, certain that truly legendary gameplay was in store. Instead, what I got was a mishmash of unrelated celebration, connected only by a grind that locks away any interesting items. Most of the rewards for the event—some really nice high-resolution retro cosmetic armor sets, toys, weapons, and pets—are earned by collecting frustratingly scarce Bronze Celebration Tokens, which are available to some degree by playing other activities in the game and partially from anniversary events themselves. We've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. Blizzard massively buffed the amount of tokens that drop after the celebration had been out only a week, but it still feels like it's not enough; particularly because the anniversary events themselves are a bit of a yawn. One of the easiest ways to complete a weekly quest for tokens, for example, involves turning yourself into your pet, jumping into a basket… and sitting there for a full minute while a counter slowly ticks up. Various iconic raid bosses are now dotted about the landscape, waiting patiently to be killed by groups that rarely come. You can show off your transmog armor sets or your mount collection, turn into your favorite raid boss or your favorite pet, and watch (and participate in) the reenactment of crucial events from the game. The biggest new offerings feel like an extension of previous Timewalking events: a new raid, based on the overly-long Blackrock Depths dungeon from vanilla WoW; and new scaled-up vanilla Timewalking dungeons, including Deadmines and Dire Maul. These are fun because they're new, if initially over-tuned. The raid in particular has required a series of nerfs to be playable by random groups. (A group from my Mythic raid-clearing guild struggled with the later bosses of Heroic difficulty BRD when it first launched.) But even those instances don't feel overly special, because we've had Timewalking dungeons and raids before, even without an anniversary event. The Korrak's Revenge PvP event is a returning feature, and the stalls and vendors at the anniversary area in Tanaris are fairly similar to the stalls and vendors from previous anniversary events—which weren't as dramatic as this one should be. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I love transmog. I love pets and mounts and toys. I ground through every level of the PvP Plunderstorm event last spring—even though I despise fighting other players—to get those cosmetic rewards. I played Pandaria Remix until I had fully leveled a dozen new alts just to buy every available mount, appearance, and toy. I should be all over this event trying to earn everything, and yet it's been a struggle just to play through it all to write this piece. It's not the rewards—they're lovely. Tier 2 was a glorious era for Warcraft raid armor, and the high resolution versions are very pretty. I want them all. The meta-achievement blue phoenix for the event, while nothing like the iconic Ashes of A'lar mount Blizzard shamelessly compares it to, is still beautiful. (It's not the skeleton, my artist friends, that makes players love the Ashes, it's those wildly over-the-top glittery streamers as you fly.) The new armor appearances modeled after Blizzard employee rewards are a nice touch, rewarding players in a similar way for loyalty, and they’re attractive to boot. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. But every single one of them requires a grind. In previous anniversaries, I got something just for logging in. This year, there were no free items. Even the typical reputation and experience buff requires a quest to unlock every few days, albeit an easy one. Token rewards drop eight at a time from significant weekly activities, but you need 60 to buy your first armor set. The cost lowers over time, but you don't get any for free. It would be like telling a Blizzard employee they get that cool sword or shield as a loyalty reward—but only if they put in 60 hours of overtime. Will I grind all those nifty appearances and rewards at some point before the event expires on January 6? Yes, begrudingly. Partially by doing content I don't care for, and partially by picking my way through the jumbled smorgasbord of activities that are fun but meaningless in combination. Did it have to feel this way? Absolutely not. Mindlessly grinding for currency is one of the least enjoyable aspects of Warcraft, and it's part of what brings down these anniversary events. The lack of any real incentive to do any particular event, since they all offer largely interchangeable rewards of that currency, doesn't help. (I am not the only person to feel this way.) The meta-achievement that rewards the Coldflame Tempest phoenix mount is a step in the right direction. It at least asks you to try everything out, which is a good reason to do everything once. But what if the entire event had been structured that way? What if the event was just a series of 20 achievements (or 30, if you wanted to represent the 30-year anniversary of the Warcraft universe)? Each achievement could bestow one of the nifty rewards, and lead to the next. You could even take the additional step of adding story quests for each. If it were more linear, it could feel like a grand adventure, from start to finish, a combination of battle and exploration and dungeoneering and showing off, instead of all of those things thrown into a messy catch-all basket with a ‘for sale for 60 tokens’ sign thrown on top. I'm honestly fine with having to grind for the other armor sets for other classes, but the first one should be my reward for participating, not grinding.Perhaps the game could even give me a terrific, engrossing story to go with my achievements too. Clearly, there were writers involved in this project; getting them together as a team and making this a real questline would have gone a long way toward hyping up this event. What about an epic achievement-wrapping mini-film from Blizzard's terrific cinematics team? It's insulting when the trailer announcing the 30th anniversary Warcraft Direct broadcast or the announcement of the 15th anniversary and the release of Warcraft Classic feel more inspiring than your 20th anniversary celebration. The most promising part of the entire event is another not-new feature: a secret-finding exploration (similar to the Secrets of Azeroth event in Dragonflight), which is still underway. There are precious few new rewards from this series if you did the last one. But at least one heart-tugging appearance of an old character has occurred thus far, and I have hopes for more.The celebration is hardly over. But so far, the 20th anniversary event has sadly been reduced to just another grind. World of Warcraft might not have invented the wheel, but it certainly made it popular—and 20 years on, the MMO titan has fundamentally changed gaming's DNA After 'regrets and lessons learned,' and 2 months of tuning, Blizzard is 'happy' with Delves as WoW's newest endgame destination It's not quite the end-of-generation sale price I've been holding out for but an RTX 4070 for a penny under $500 isn't too bad PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Share this article Franklin Templeton expanded trading of its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to the Ethereum blockchain, adding to its multi-chain presence in the tokenized asset space. The $410 million fund, which launched in 2021 as the first money market fund to use public blockchain for tracking transactions and ownership, now ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) leads with $545 million, followed by Ondo’s U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) at $452 million. The asset manager has been actively expanding the fund’s blockchain support, recently adding Coinbase’s Base, Aptos, and Avalanche networks, while maintaining Stellar as its primary public blockchain. BlackRock also expanded its BUIDL fund yesterday to include blockchain networks such as Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet and Polygon. Ethereum currently dominates the tokenized treasury market with $1.6 billion in assets, positioning itself ahead of Stellar (XLM) and Solana (SOL). Currently, approximately 71% of tokenized Treasury fund assets under management (AUM) are on Ethereum, followed by 17% on Stellar and 5.8% on Solana, according to data by rwa.xyz. The remaining funds are distributed across smaller networks, including Arbitrum, Noble, Optimism, Mantle, Aptos, Sui, and Base. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: New BusConnects routes pushed back until January due to risk of Christmas confusion

New BusConnects services which were due to come into effect in December have been deferred until January, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has announced. The NTA said introducing the changes in the run up to Christmas may have caused confusion among bus passengers. They were originally planned to be implemented on December 8th. The routes affected include two 24-hour, cross-city “spine” routes E1 and E2. These routes are to areas including Bray, Dublin city centre, Ballymun and Santry. Radial 19, a route running between Dublin Airport, DCU and Parnell Square is also affected, as are routes X1 and X2 from Kilcoole, Co Wicklow, to the city centre, and Newcastle, Co Wicklow, to the city centre respectively. A series of L routes serving Bray, north Wicklow and South Dublin are also affected: Together the routes form Phase 6A of the wider BusConnects project. The exact revised implementation date for Phase 6A in January has yet to be announced. A spokesman for the NTA said “we believe that the short-term disruption that the changes would involve for some customers would be an unwelcome complication in the run-up to Christmas”. “The rescheduling of Phase 6A will free up resources, allowing additional bus services, including additional night services, to operate over the Christmas period. “This will contribute to the city centre promotional campaign planned by Dublin City Council and businesses, and will support the retail and hospitality sector in the city and suburbs during the busy December period.” Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust Sees Explosive $3 Billion Inflows Amid BTC Surge

The spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen over $3 billion of inflows over the past five days. According to data from Farside Investors, on November 7 BlackRock’s fund saw $1.119 billion inflows, while on the following day its inflows topped the $206 million mark. At the start of this week, the fund saw $756.5 million coming in, while on November 12 it brought in $778.3 million. On November 13, IBIT saw $230.8 million inflows. In total, the fund saw over $3 billion inflows, at a time in which cryptocurrency prices were surging. Over the past week, BTC’s rise rose 21.1% to now trade at $90,700, down from a new all-time high around $93,000. As CryptoGlobe reported, the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States earlier this year have seen their total assets cross the $90 billion mark after seeing a $6 billion ump in a single day, and are now over three-thirds of the way of surpassing gold ETFs in assets. That’s according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) pointed out that spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $6 billion jump in a day came with $1 billion of inflows, and $5 billion of market appreciation amid a significant BTC price rise. According to Farside Investors’ data, spot Bitcoin ETFs’ total cumulative flow is at $28.3 billion. Notably, cryptocurrency investment products have also been seeing significant inflows, bringing in $1.98 billion in the week after Republican candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. According to CoinShares latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the inflows couple with the cryptocurrency market rally have pushed the total assets under management of crypto investment products to a $116 billion high. The report details that Bitcoin-focused investment products saw $1.79 billion inflows over the past week, while Ethereum-focused products saw $157 million inflows. Featured image via Pexels.

Title: BlackRock Expanding Tokenized Fund BUIDL to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon

BlackRock announced on Wednesday that it is expanding its tokenized liquidity fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to operate on multiple blockchain platforms. According to the press release, the fund, originally launched on Ethereum in March 2024 and tokenized through Securitize, will now extend to new share classes on Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism’s OP Mainnet, and Polygon. This strategic expansion, as BlackRock and Securitize claim, is part of an ongoing push to enhance tokenization in the financial sector. By integrating with these blockchain networks, BUIDL reportedly aims to offer improved interoperability, enabling applications and users to interact with the fund more efficiently. The fund is expected to provide users with on-chain yield opportunities, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, flexible custody options, and the ability to accrue and distribute dividends on-chain. The firms involved highlight that BUIDL has already reached a significant milestone, becoming the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) within 40 days of its initial launch. BlackRock asserts that expanding the fund’s presence across multiple blockchains will offer increased flexibility and access for various market participants, including decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and firms native to the digital asset sector. The goal, according to the release, is to allow developers to leverage the fund within their preferred blockchain environments. Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, stated that this move aligns with the company’s vision of building a robust, blockchain-native financial ecosystem. He noted that real-world asset tokenization is scaling up and that the addition of new blockchains could potentially enhance the capabilities of the BUIDL ecosystem. Domingo believes this expansion could drive further interest from investors looking to utilize blockchain technology for increased efficiency. BNY Mellon is mentioned as playing a role in facilitating this cross-chain integration. Acting as the fund administrator and custodian, BNY reportedly helped BUIDL go live on these additional blockchain platforms. Each blockchain network will host a distinct share class of the BUIDL fund with specific management fees. For instance: The new blockchains are intended to enhance the interoperability of BUIDL, potentially opening up new avenues for integration with various decentralized applications. Investors are cautioned that the fund carries various risks associated with blockchain investments, including regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. BlackRock emphasizes that BUIDL is designed for qualified investors with a high tolerance for risk, given that it operates under exemptions from U.S. securities registration requirements. The minimum investment threshold for BUIDL is set at $5 million, targeting institutional clients rather than retail investors.

Crypto ETF issuer and asset manager BlackRock announced on Wednesday the expansion of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to include five new blockchain ecosystems: Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Initially launched on the Ethereum network in March 2024, BUIDL rapidly gained traction among investors, becoming the largest tokenized fund globally regarding assets under management (AUM) within just 40 days. The expansion will allow BUIDL to interact with more blockchain-based financial products and infrastructures. BlackRock aims to enhance accessibility for investors, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and digital asset firms, enabling them to leverage BUIDL within the ecosystems of their choice. Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, the firm responsible for tokenizing BUIDL, emphasized the importance of this multi-chain approach in Wednesday’s press release by saying: Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do. With the addition of these blockchains, BlackRock aims to provide increased options and access for investors, allowing developers to build applications that integrate seamlessly with the BUIDL fund. BNY Mellon, which recently received a Bitcoin and crypto custody license for institutional services, will play a key role in this initiative as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL. On the crypto ETF front, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has reached a remarkable milestone, surpassing the $40 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) just two weeks after hitting $30 billion. This achievement comes in a record 211 days, shattering the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG). IBIT is now positioned in the top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at just 10 months old, it has outperformed all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, according to ETF expert Eric Balchunas. Balchunas further highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively have crossed the $90 billion asset threshold, following a significant $6 billion surge in the past few days. This increase comprises $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs indicates that they are now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. The rise in Bitcoin ETF assets has coincided with a surge in investor confidence, particularly following Donald Trump’s recent victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential elections. This political shift has positively influenced market sentiment, contributing to a broader uptick in cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin, in particular, has experienced a substantial rally, climbing over 24% to reach a record high of $93,000 in the past week alone.

Title: Where Will the COP29 Money Come From?
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/where-will-the-cop29-money-come-from-11731551991475.html
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:39:51Z

(Bloomberg) -- COP29 Daily Reports: Sign up for the Green Daily newsletter for comprehensive coverage of the climate summit right in your inbox. The COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, has been dubbed the “finance COP” because its primary objective is to come up with a new and ambitious agreement for climate-related transfers from rich countries to poor countries. But that moniker could have been given to almost any of the other recent United Nations gatherings of world leaders: the COP26 confab in Glasgow in 2021 focused on enlisting institutional investors in the fight against global warming; the crowning achievement of the gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh the following year was a fund to help developing nations face the devastation of climate change; and at last year’s COP28 event, the United Arab Emirates announced a $30 billion venture to fund emissions reductions projects in partnership with BlackRock Inc., TPG Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. Whether it’s Azerbaijan’s manat, or dirhams, pounds or dollars, every climate conversation circles back to how much it will cost — and who’s going to pay. In Baku, that means fighting over a so-called collective and quantified goal for climate finance. That’s the new post-2025 ambition that’s supposed to replace a target set in 2009 for developed countries to provide $100 billion annually by 2020. The earlier goal has proven controversial since it wasn’t met until 2022, and represents just a fraction of the money needed. Even if the new target were to be set at as much as $1 trillion a year, as some of the most climate-vulnerable states have proposed, that would barely scratch the surface. New research published this week by law firm A&O Shearman details an annual $6 trillion investment gap through 2030 to decarbonize the global economy at a pace required by the Paris climate agreement, to say nothing of the cost of adapting to a warmer, more volatile world. Moving from the billions to the trillions will only be possible by involving the private sector. Yet while COP28 in Dubai drew many of Wall Street’s top leaders, from hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio to BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink, COP29 is set to be a much more low-key affair. This year, banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc have sent delegations to Azerbaijan, though these typically include members of their sustainability teams as opposed to senior executives. And that might be the appropriate choice given the more technical nature of this year’s discussion, said Adair Turner, who previously ran Britain’s financial regulator and is now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission. Financiers in attendance “will be those who want to interface with people actually building the new energy system, rather than people making grand statements,” he said. The biggest opportunities for Baku may not be “on these grand political statements,” Turner said. “We’re not going to get a tightening of the ‘transitioning beyond fossil fuels’ statement, but what we could get is some very concrete things about technologies,” such as commitments to scale up battery storage and grid interconnections, he said. Daniel Hanna, group head of sustainable and transition finance at Barclays, who has traveled to Baku, said he was “looking forward to talking about the progress that’s been made on climate finance, while recognizing that we need to collaborate to move faster and smarter on scaling the next wave of climate technologies, investing in adaptation and finding new public-private models to scale capital into the Global South.” For Turner, who spoke with Bloomberg Green on the first day of COP29, “the single most important thing” to secure at Baku is “a bigger role for development banks.” And right on cue, on Tuesday, the world’s largest multilateral development banks (MDB) announced a new goal to raise $120 billion in annual climate finance for developing nations by the end of the decade, a significant increase on the $75 billion gathered in 2023. MDBs can use their balance sheets to reduce the risks for private investors from allocating funds to nascent technologies and countries, where high credit risks to corruption typically result in a punitive cost of capital. “Many institutional investors are fiduciaries of retirement assets with a duty to focus on returns, and a lot of climate projects just don’t fit that profile without some risk-sharing or guarantees,” said Cara Williams, global head of ESG, climate and sustainability at Mercer. “We hope to see agreements on more public private partnerships announced at COP29 to de-risk investments and make it easier for private capital to be allocated to sustainable-finance projects.” And with many developed governments “under pressure fiscally,”making a modest contribution toward beefing up the MDBs “ought to be the easy win,” Turner said.“The amount of money that’s required to increase the capital resources of the World Bank are really relatively small compared with other things, so it ought to be the win-win here,” he said. Of course, there are very few easy wins in climate. And that’s especially so with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed climate change while promoting fossil fuels, returning to the White House. Sustainable finance in brief Speaking of which, one of the main drivers behind the right-wing campaign against environmental, social and governance strategies — other than Big Oil and its lobbyists — has been Trump himself. Now that he’s on the way back to the White House, experts expect him to try and finish off ESG. That would mean blocking Securities and Exchange Commission rules for corporate and fund disclosures, and Labor Department requirements on pension funds, according to Rob Du Boff, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The new administration also is expected to put limits on ESG-related shareholder proposals filed during proxy season, he said. “The bottom line is the Trump administration is anxious to undermine these ESG-related initiatives,” Du Boff said.

Title: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-peak-200-days-us-recession-2025-report/
Time Published: 2024-11-14T02:30:56Z
Full Content:
The current Bitcoin (BTC) rally could extend until mid-2025, with a potential price peak before a US recession. A recent Copper Research report, a recent crypto research firm, posits that the leading cryptocurrency by market cap could extend its bullish momentum until mid-2025. As of November 13, Bitcoin is on day 555 of its current market cycle, and a price peak for the digital asset could arrive within the next 200 days. Notably, this peak may coincide with a potential US recession forecasted for mid-2025. According to the report, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days. The starting point of these cycles is when the annual average growth of Bitcoin’s market capitalization turns positive, while the endpoint is when it hits a price peak. The report marks the beginning of the current market cycle around mid-2023, just before asset manager BlackRock filed for a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Should Bitcoin stay true to its historical price patterns, the digital asset can hit its price peak for this cycle sometime around mid-2025. The report cites estimates by JPMorgan about the likelihood of a US recession in mid-2025. As a result, BTC’s price peak might align with a potential US economic downturn. Based on data from Treasury spreads, JPMorgan gives a 45% chance of a potential US recession by mid-2025. The report further highlights the gap between BTC’s price top and realized volatility. For the uninitiated, realized volatility measures BTC’s price fluctuations over a specific period, showing the standard deviation of the asset’s returns from the market’s mean return. BTC’s realized volatility currently stands at around 50%, indicating that its volatility is only halfway to previous bull market peaks. Another bullish technical indicator for the BTC price trajectory is its filtered relative strength index (RSI). The report reads: Currently, the RSI sits at 60 – well below previous bull market highs – indicating considerable room for Bitcoin to continue building momentum into the new year. The digital assets market has been on a strong upward trend since pro-crypto Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Notably, the emerging industry has witnessed its total market cap surge beyond $3 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The rise in total crypto market cap – largely driven by BTC – is not surprising since the Trump administration is speculated to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve akin to that of El Salvador under Nayib Bukele. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price action has propelled the digital asset’s total market cap beyond that of silver, solidifying it as the 8th largest global asset by market cap in existence. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see how BTC dominance (BTC.D) behaves in the coming weeks, especially after facing rejection just below the $90,000 level. Currently hovering slightly above 60%, a fall in BTC.D could signal a capital rotation from BTC into altcoins, potentially benefiting smaller-cap digital assets. BTC trades at $87,767 at press time, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The asset’s total market cap sits at $1.738 trillion.

Title: Every Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct Announcement

Time Published: 2024-11-14T00:15:00Z

Published: Nov 13, 2024 07:15 pm The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct was full of incredible surprises from across every Warcraft title, including some we haven’t seen in generations. From player housing (yes!) to a Classic refresh and The War Within 11.1, here’s every announcement from the livestream. The Warcraft 30th Direct kicked off where it all began: the RTS series. Starting today, Warcraft III: Reforged will update to version 2.0, boasting customizable updated visuals, quality-of-life changes (like hotkey customization), a revamped ladder, and “much, much more.” That’s not all when it comes to Warcraft, though! Warcraft I and II are both receiving Remasters with hand-drawn graphics and much-needed QoL improvements, including health bars, tooltips, a fancy new mission select screen, faster speed, band-box select, and increased unit selection. Phew. Warcraft I Remastered and Warcraft II Remastered launch today (November 13th) alongside the new Warcraft Battle Chest, which includes both remasters and Warcraft III: Reforged — as well as the beautiful Meat Wagon mount in World of Warcraft. The first major patch for WoW: The War Within is Undermined, kicking off Season 2 with lots of goblin goodies, including: From 30th Anniversary Direct’s footage, Undermined looks absolutely phenomenal. The art team didn’t miss here, with Liberation of Undermine potentially shaping up to be one of the best-looking raids of all time. The previously-announced Siren Isle will be hit live servers next month, with epilogues and story content leading us toward Undermined and beyond. According to the 2025 Roadmap, Plunderstorm will return between 11.0.7 and 11.1 with its promised new rewards. That’s right, they’ve finally done it. Player housing is coming to World of Warcraft… In the next expansion. World of Warcraft Midnight will introduce player housing after two decades of fan requests, though we don’t know to what extent just yet. Blizzard will announce more about player housing and Midnight in late summer 2025. Speaking of upcoming content, the 2025 World of Warcraft roadmap details a basic content outline up to the beginning of winter: World of Warcraft: The War Within Heartlands, a 5-part audio novella available right now. Heartlands is written by Adam Christopher and narrated by the legendary Chris Metzen, exploring what happened to Jaina and Thrall while we were busy adventuring in Khaz Algar. Any World of Warcraft Classic player knows the fanbase has been begging for a Classic Era refresh, and I’m happy to say that it’s finally happening. The Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct announced fresh starts for World of Warcraft Classic begin on November 21 with WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition. World of Warcraft Classic 20th Anniversary features “very large” realms with PvE, PvP, and even Hardcore options. Additionally, QoL features like the Chronoboon Displacer and PvP Honor System will be available from the start. Like before, the experience will be split into phases over the course of around a year, before transitioning to… The Burning Crusade Classic returns in late 2025! WoW Classic 20th Anniversary characters will progress into TBC Classic after the conclusion of Phase 6, with the exception of Hardcore characters. It seems like Hardcore TBC isn’t quite on the table just yet. World of Warcraft Cataclysm Classic will wrap up with The Hour of Twilight patch in December. The not-so-surprising announce Once Dragon Soul has been swept up, Mists of Pandaria Classic will replace Cataclysm in Autumn 2025. The pre-patch, which brings Pandaren, Monks, Pet Battles, and Theramore’s Fall will fly in Summer 2025. Last, but certainly not least in the 30th Anniversary Direct WoW Classic announcements, is Season of Discovery Phase 7. Late Winter 2024 will see the arrival of Naxxramas and brand-new endgame content starring the Scarlet Crusade and Deadwind Pass. 👀 pic.twitter.com/RzjIa1oe4t Additionally, new Qiraji battle tank mounts were briefly teased in the live stream, presumably for new Ahn’Qiraj content in Phase Six. Coming out of nowhere like a sudden swarm of Zerg was the reveal of Heroes of Starcraft, a mini-set for Hearthstone based on the iconic Blizzard series landing in January 2025. The Zerg, Terran, and Protoss are each represented as factions with their own hero card: Along with cards full of Starcraft characters and references (plus a certain Murloc), Heroes of Starcraft features new music and visuals in Hearthstone’s most extensive mini-set to date. Being almost entirely unchanged in the decade since its launch (ouch, my back), Arena is set to receive some significant updates early next year. Players can choose between two versions of Arena: standard Arena with shortened runs and Underground Arena, featuring longer runs and a new “Redraft on Loss” feature. Redraft on Loss allows you to redraw cards and tweak your deck after a loss in Underground Arena. Both Arena modes will feature separate Arena ratings, with regular Arena matching players with similar skill levels, while Underground features a wild mix of player abilities. The 30th Anniversary direct showcased the roadmap for Year of the Raptor in Hearthstone, featuring three new expansions: Into the Emerald Dream, The Shrouded City, and The Heroes of Time. Into the Emerald Dream features the Druids of the Emerald Dream in a face-off with The Old Gods, heating up mid-season with a Druids of the Flame mini-set. The Shrouded City is Hearthstone’s first sequel set, sending players back to Un’goro to explore and party in the Festival of the Dinosaur mini-set. Finally, The Heroes of Time is a time-travel set featuring alternate realities and an epic final battle with Murozond in the End Time mini-set. What happens at the end of the expansion is something “[we] won’t believe.” The heavens have heard my call, and the once-mobile exclusive Warcraft Rumble is launching on PC with a beta on December 10, 2024. Alongside the beta are three new “Split Leaders”, who belong to multiple families: In addition to these exciting new heroes, Sylvanas will also become a split leader, joining the Horde alongside the Undead. That wraps it up for every announcement from Warcraft’s 30th Anniversary Direct livestream! What are you most excited for? World of Warcraft and Warcraft Battle Chest are available now on PC. Hearthstone is available on PC and mobile devices. Warcraft Rumble is exclusive to mobile devices until it arrives on PC later this year.

Title: 15 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the global whiskey market, the Irish whiskey renaissance, and sustainability in the Irish whiskey industry, and go directly to the 5 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. One of the oldest distilled spirits in the world, Irish whiskey is most often produced from a combination of malted and unmalted barley and is widely appreciated for its exceptionally smooth flavor and hints of vanilla. The use of unmalted grain began as a way to reduce the tax imposed on malted barley in the middle of the 19th century and is a key factor that distinguishes Irish whiskey from Scotch. Also, while most other whiskeys are twice distilled, Irish whiskeys are usually distilled three times in a column or pot still before they are matured in wooden casks for a minimum of three years. These intricate production steps combine to give the spirit its mellow and approachable character and turn it into a true gem of the Emerald Isle. READ ALSO: 25 Best-Selling Whiskey Brands in the US and 30 Best-Selling Scotch Whisky Brands in the World. Whiskey is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World, with the global whiskey market valued at $64 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $91.3 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period. The consumption of alcohol is shifting away from beer and wine and millennials are more likely to experiment with other alcoholic beverages, resulting in the growth of a ‘cocktail culture’. As a result of this tendency, the use of whiskey as a premium ingredient has increased. Product innovations such as flavored whiskeys and organic and sustainable options are also some of the major factors propelling the market. Ireland, once the grand capital of whiskey, is now once again making a grand comeback. The Emerald Isle has gone from once having just two operating distilleries – Bushmills and Midleton – to around 45 currently in operation, and several more in the pipeline. The value of Ireland’s whiskey exports crossed the €1 billion ($1.1 billion) mark for the first time in 2022, with global sales of Irish whiskey growing by 10.3% that year to around 15.25 million cases. The United States continues to be the top market for the category, representing 57% of the total export value. The Irish distillers have been especially focused on premiumization and the strategy seems to be paying off, as more and more consumers across the pond are turning to the smooth spirit as their luxury dram of choice. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, high-end premium and super-premium Irish whiskey categories have grown by an eye-watering 1,053% and 2,769%, respectively, in the last 20 years. Today’s consumers are increasingly aware of the climate emergency and actively seek out sustainable brands, even if it means paying extra. Therefore, as whiskey makers find themselves in an increasingly competitive market, committing psychologically and economically to reducing their impact on the planet may also be the only means to make their businesses sustainable in the long run. In this regard, it was announced last year that Irish Distillers, the Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)-owned producer of some of the world’s most renowned and successful Irish whiskeys, would adopt packaging changes such as removing gift boxes from its Jameson range. The removal will result in four million units being eliminated by the end of 2025 and will also be applied to other brands such as Powers, Spot, and Knappogue Castle. Irish Distillers also revealed in 2022 that it would invest around $55 million to fund projects aimed at transforming Midleton – home of some of the most popular Irish whiskey brands like Jameson, Redbreast, Powers, and Spot – into the first carbon-neutral whiskey distillery in the country by the end of 2026. The project includes shifting the distillery to renewable energy, increasing the efficiency of operations, and recycling the heat that is created as a byproduct of distillation. The aforementioned moves are all part of Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY)’s Sustainability and Responsibility 2030 roadmap, which addresses environmental issues, social responsibility, and combatting alcohol abuse. If it stays on this path of sustainability, Irish whiskey can be at the heart of the blueprint to protect Ireland’s unique environment, while also continuing to be a modern, competitive, and successful industry that produces some of the best whiskeys in the world. With a market cap of over $30 billion as of the writing of this article, Pernod Ricard SA (OTC:PRNDY) is included among the Most Valuable Alcohol Companies in the World. While we acknowledge the potential of PRNDY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PRNDY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. With that said, here are the Most Popular Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. Pixabay/Public Domain To collect data for this article, we have referred to The Brand Champions 2024 magazine by The Spirits Business, looking for the Top-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World. We found information for only the top 3 best-selling Irish whiskey brands in the magazine and so we ranked them by the sales volumes of their 9-liter cases in 2023. Due to the absence of reliable sales figures for the remaining brands, we resorted to using popularity as a proxy for sales. Therefore, we picked whiskeys that appeared multiple times on websites like VinePair, Liquor, Men’s Journal, Reddit, etc., assigned them a score of 1 each time they were recommended on these sources, and then summed up the scores and ranked our list accordingly. When two or more brands had the same score, we ranked them by the number of upvotes they received on Reddit. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Insider Monkey Score: 4 Glendalough is often billed as being ‘Ireland's First Craft Distillery’ and is known for creating some innovative world-firsts such as the first Irish single malt whiskey aged in rare Japanese Mizunara oak, or an Irish single malt aged in Wicklow Irish oak, etc. Glendalough also pays special attention to staying sustainable and was named Ireland’s 'Sustainable Distillery of the Year' by the Icons of Whisky Awards in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Here we have an extremely smooth and creamy single-malt whiskey made by the Cooley Distillery, now owned by the Japanese Suntory Holdings. The Tyrconnell was claimed to be the top-selling Irish whiskey before Prohibition and its success continues to this day, as it is currently one of the fastest-growing Irish single malts in the world. Insider Monkey Score: 5 Also produced by the famous Cooley Distillery in County Louth, Connemara’s complex peat flavors and smooth, sweet malt taste make it a truly unique offering. Connemara is regarded as one of the pioneers of smoky Irish whiskeys and has even been honored as the 'World's Best Irish Single Malt', among other accolades. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Founded by father and son Henry and Alex Conyngham in 2009, Slane uses quality ingredients and an innovative recipe to create an exceptionally complex and smooth whiskey. Slane was acquired by Brown-Forman in 2015, following which the Jack Daniel’s maker made a hefty investment of $50 million to build a new four-acre distilling site to produce the award-winning whiskey. Insider Monkey Score: 6 Owned by the Sazerac Company, Paddy’s is a premium, triple-distilled blend of grain, malt, and pot still whiskeys. Often described as unpretentious and friendly, this popular Irish whiskey is great for mixing and has some very loyal fans, particularly in the south of Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 6 One of the most famous Irish whiskey brands in recent years is Conor McGregor’s Proper No. Twelve – a smooth blend of triple-distilled malt and grain whiskey aged for four years in bourbon barrels, delivering a delicious taste with hints of vanilla, honey-like sweetness, and toasted wood. A majority stake in the brand was acquired by Proximo Spirits for a reported $600 million in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 7 A unique marriage of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey, Walsh Whiskey’s Writers’ Tears is a critically acclaimed, award-winning recreation of the fabled 19th-century dram that was a favorite among the literary giants of the era. Insider Monkey Score: 8 Named after the castle in County Clare, Kannpogue Castle is a range of vintaged Irish whiskeys that was originally founded by American Mark Edwin Andrews in the 1960s. One of the Top 10 Best-Selling Irish Whiskey Brands in the World, Knappogue Castle was acquired by Irish Distillers in 2021. Insider Monkey Score: 13 Dedicated to bringing new and innovative flavors to Irish whiskey, the Teeling Distillery opened its doors in 2015 as the first new distillery in Dublin in over 125 years. In less than a decade since its launch, the brand is already exported to over 80 markets worldwide and has won hundreds of international awards for its quality and depth of flavor. Insider Monkey Score: 14 With a history that spans over two centuries, Powers is the truest expression of Irish whiskey made at the Midleton distillery in County Cork. The brand has been part of Pernod Ricard since 1989. A three-time gold winner at the Irish Whiskey Masters in 2021, 2022, and 2023, the flagship Powers Gold is one of the Best-Selling Whiskeys in Ireland. Insider Monkey Score: 17 Distilled at Midleton for the family-owned Mitchell & Son Wine Merchants, the Spot series offers some of the finest examples of pot still whiskey available today. Produced in limited volumes, they are among the rare single pot still whiskeys still made today in a process that results in an intense, characterful aroma. With its fresh fruit and delicate spices, the iconic Green Spot whiskey was also included in our list of the Best Whiskeys in the World in 2024. Insider Monkey Score: 20 The most awarded single pot still Irish whiskey in the world, Redbreast is the definitive expression of this quintessential style of Irish whiskey making. Keeping up with its innovative spirit, the brand also introduced the Redbreast Tawny Port Cask Edition in September 2023, a limited-edition expression finished in tawny port casks from Portugal's breathtaking Douro Valley. With 56,000 9-liter cases sold in the US last year, Redbreast is one of the Best-Selling Irish Whiskeys in America. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.1 million Established in 1608, Bushmills is the oldest whiskey distillery in the world and is renowned for making exceptional triple-distilled single malt and blended Irish whiskeys. Proximo Spirits, owner of Bushmills, unveiled its new $48 million Causeway Distillery last year which has more than doubled its annual production from 5 million liters to 11 million. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 1.6 million Tullamore D.E.W. prides itself on its complex yet approachable flavors, which it credits to its use of three types of grain, a triple distillation, and the blending of three types of Irish whiskey – single malt, single grain, and pot still. Its sweet, soft, faint, and easy-to-drink character makes it one of the Best Whiskeys for Beginners in 2024. Set in the heart of Ireland, the Tullamore distillery spans a whopping 58 acres where 11 million liters of whiskey are produced each year, making Tullamore D.E.W. one of the finest examples of Ireland’s whiskey renaissance. 9-Liter Cases Sold in 2023: 10.2 million One of the Most Popular Whiskey Brands in the World, Jameson’s blended whiskeys are produced from malted and unmalted Irish barley before being triple-distilled, resulting in exceptional smoothness. Part of the Pernod Group since 1988, Jameson’s portfolio is led by its core offering of Jameson Original, with its super-premium expression, Jameson Black Barrel, also experiencing dynamic growth and offering a new taste experience. With a staggering 10.2 million 9-liter cases sold last year, Jameson is, by a margin, the #1 Selling Irish Whiskey in the World.

Title: BlackRock Announces BUIDL Expansion Across Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon

Asset management titan BlackRock is announcing the expansion of its proprietary BUIDL, the company’s on-chain money market fund, across five new blockchains. According to an announcement by real-world asset tokenizing firm Securitize, BlackRock’s brokerage partner, BUIDL will be expanding to layer-1 blockchains Aptos (APT) and Avalanche (AVAX) as well as layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL). As stated by Securitize chief executive and co-founder Carlos Domingo, “We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization. Real-world asset tokenization is scaling, and we’re excited to have these blockchains added to increase the potential of the BUIDL ecosystem. With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BUIDL, which launched in March and stands for BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, is a tokenized money-market fund designed to offer a stable value of $1 per token while providing yield on US Treasuries. According to Securitize, the expansion will help developers, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and other crypto firms to build with BlackRock’s product on their blockchain of choice. Last month, it was reported that BlackRock was in talks with numerous crypto exchange platforms – such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit – about using BUIDL as collateral for derivatives contracts.

Title: Protesters Take to MoMA During World Jewish Congress Gala

Become a Member One person was taken into police custody last night, November 12, at a protest outside the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) during the World Jewish Congress’s (WJC) 2024 Theodor Herzl Award Dinner taking place at the institution.Some 40 people gathered outside the museum’s 53rd Street entrance yesterday evening in response to a call shared by pro-Palestine advocacy groups, including Writers Against the War on Gaza (WAWOG) and Within Our Lifetime, to protest MoMA Honorary Board Chair Ronald Lauder. The billionaire heir to the Estée Lauder fortune is also the president of the WJC, a federation of Jewish communities and Israel advocates. Founded in 1936 to “support the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine,” among other aims, the organization regularly lobbies on behalf of Israel and has rejected reports presented to the United Nations alleging that Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza constitute genocide. Before the protest began at around 5:30pm, police had sectioned off the institution’s main entrance, where the group crowded around a sign that read “MoMA Trustees Fund Genocide Apartheid and Settler Colonialism.” Chanting “Free Palestine” and “No justice, no peace,” they called on MoMA to disaffiliate from “dirty money.” A woman wearing an Israeli flag draped around her shoulders made her way into the group of protesters around 6:30pm and was escorted out of the crowd by police seconds later without the flag. Hyperallergic also witnessed an altercation between a suited man and a protester wearing a keffiyeh; the protester, who declined to provide his name, alleged that the man yanked at the Palestinian headscarf on his neck. A police officer then ushered the suited man inside MoMA. Get the latest art news, reviews and opinions from Hyperallergic. Writer Sarah Nicole Prickett, a WAWOG organizer, was stopped by two police officers as she was crossing the street between two groups of protesters on both sides of the barricaded entrance. She was charged with disorderly conduct, according to a summons note reviewed by Hyperallergic. A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed that one person was taken into custody and released with a summons to appear in criminal court next month. In an interview with Hyperallergic, Prickett said, “The least we can do is disorder things.” “We want these institutions to know that they can no longer silently, tacitly, and inconsequentially participate in the death-dealing activities of organizations like the World Jewish Congress,” she said. MoMA has not replied to Hyperallergic’s request for comment. The WJC’s Theodor Herzl Award, named after the man credited as the founder of Zionism, was given this year to former United States Ambassador to China and Russia Jon M. Huntsman Jr. as a “devoted friend of Israel and the Jewish people.” Tal Huber, the Israeli graphic designer behind the red, black, and white “Kidnapped” posters wheat-pasted globally in the aftermath of Hamas’s October 7 attack, was also honored at last night’s gala with an award for advancing Jewish culture. During his gala address, recorded in a video posted to the WJC’s YouTube channel and reviewed by Hyperallergic, Lauder mocked what he said was an effort to rename Thanksgiving to “Indigenous People’s Appreciation and Remembrance Day.” In 2019, Donald Trump claimed at a rally that liberals wanted to change the name of the holiday but did not specify to what. “Now Thanksgiving has turned into a day that sees the same pilgrims not as brave souls who risked everything to escape religious persecution in Europe, they are now seen as colonial occupiers,” Lauder said. Later in his remarks, Lauder added, “This is hardly an American phenomenon. The Jewish world has been watching this self-hatred throughout Europe in France and England … That is why the World Jewish Congress is now focusing all our efforts on education and fighting this Marxist indoctrination that has infiltrated our schools.” Bobuq Sayed, a New York City-based writer from the Afghan diaspora who participated in the action, told Hyperallergic that they were protesting because “cultural institutions like the MoMA have a responsibility to cultural workers and not to billionaire benefactors.” Graphic designer Liv Senghor also attended the protest as an organizer of the environmental action group Planet Over Profit. “We thought it was important for us to show up as climate protesters to show solidarity and that we understand that all our struggles are connected,” Senghor said. MoMA has been the target of several protest campaigns targeting trustees’ links to human rights violations, military violence, and environmental damage. In 2021, a 10-week action series known as Strike MoMA called on the museum to drop board members including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and financier Leon Black. In the wake of pressure over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including an open letter from artists published in Hyperallergic, Black stepped down from his role as board chairman but remains a museum trustee. The World Jewish Congress has not yet responded to a request for comment.

By Blizzard Entertainment 2 days ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

Title: BlackRock strengthens tokenization push with BUIDL’s multi-chain expansion

BUIDL's growth on popular blockchains promises new ventures for DAOs and digital firms, despite varied fees. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has expanded its reach to multiple blockchain networks, including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon, according to a Nov. 13 statement. This expansion is part of BlackRock’s strategy to strengthen its tokenization efforts, transforming BUIDL into a multi-chain asset. It enables users and applications within these blockchain ecosystems to access BUIDL more efficiently. The fund, which primarily invests in US Treasuries, cash, and other liquid assets, will offer new users across these blockchain networks features such as on-chain yield, flexible custody, real-time peer-to-peer transfers, and on-chain dividend accrual and distribution. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasized that the expansion aligns with the company’s vision to build a tokenization-based ecosystem. He pointed out that these new blockchains would enhance BUIDL’s potential, especially as the tokenization of real-world assets continues to gain traction. He stated: “With these new chains we’ll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do.” BNY Mellon, the fund’s administrator, is backing this expansion and will continue to act as its custodian across these additional blockchain networks. According to the press statement, BUIDL became the largest tokenized fund by assets under management (AUM) less than 40 days after its launch on the Ethereum blockchain. According to DeFillama data, BUIDL’s market capitalization stood at $518 million at the time of writing. The expansion to other blockchain networks opens up new investment opportunities for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), digital asset firms, and other market participants. Meanwhile, the expansion also brings new management fees for different networks. The fund’s users across Aptos, Avalanche, and Polygon PoS will be charged a fee of 20 basis points, while Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Optimism users will incur a 50-basis-point fee.

By Blizzard Entertainment 2 days ago It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 18:00 GMT through December 11 at 18:00 GMT. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

Title: How Vivek Ramaswamy Became A Billionaire
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhyatt/2024/11/13/how-vivek-ramaswamy-became-a-billionaire/
Time Published: 2024-11-13T19:39:20Z
Full Content:
UPDATE, November 13, 2024: On November 12, a week after Donald Trump won the presidential election, he named billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as co-heads of a new entity, the Department of Government Efficiency. Already nicknamed DOGE, it is tasked with cutting wasteful expenditures, slashing excessive regulations and restructuring federal agencies. “This is truly a once-in-a-century opportunity. We will be radically transparent about the government waste we uncover,” Ramaswamy posted on X on Thursday, November 13. Here’s the inside story—first published by Forbes in August 2023—on how Ramaswamy, the lesser known and less rich Musk counterpart, made his own billion-dollar fortune. Standing in a packed New Hampshire restaurant, Vivek Ramaswamy, the fresh-faced Republican shaking up the 2024 presidential race, is making a case for unifying a bitterly divided nation. The secret, he insists, is as American as apple pie: capitalism. “Democrats and Republicans alike, we tend to be more proud of a country when we’re all making more money in that country,” he tells 100 or so diners enjoying turkey sandwiches and diet Cokes. “We don’t have to flog ourselves for capitalism. Stop apologizing for capitalism. We should embrace capitalism.” Ramaswamy certainly has. At 38 years old, the biotech investor and “anti-woke” warrior is worth more than $950 million. His net worth was over $1 billion about a week ago, making him one of the 20 youngest billionaires in the country, before a downturn in the market pulled him just under the billion-dollar threshold, according to Forbes’ calculations. Still, he appears to be the second-wealthiest person competing in the Republican presidential primary, behind only Donald Trump (whose net worth Forbes last pegged at $2.5 billion). Ramawamy’s fortune stems from a drug-development company named Roivant Sciences, which went public in 2021. Its stock is up nearly 40% this year, boosting the value of Ramaswamy’s 10% stake to roughly $600 million. Since founding the company nine years ago, he has sucked over $260 million out of Roivant in the form of salary, bonuses and capital gains. He diversified those proceeds into a pretty standard investment portfolio, roughly 60% stocks and 40% bonds. But he also added some flavor, with a dash of Bitcoin and Ethereum, some shares of YouTube competitor Rumble and a stake in crypto payments firm MoonPay. Then there are his political interests. In 2021, Ramaswamy stepped down as CEO of Roivant and got into politics, authoring a book called “Woke, Inc.,” which criticized corporate America’s growing focus on social justice issues and the ESG (environmental, social and governance) movement taking over Wall Street. A year later, he founded an “anti-woke” index fund provider—think BlackRock, without all the talk about saving the world—named Strive Asset Management. Investors recently valued Strive at a lofty $300 million or so, according to two individuals familiar with the financing, implying that Ramaswamy’s stake is worth well over $100 million. It’s a lot of money to make in a little amount of time. The son of Indian immigrants—Ramaswamy’s father an engineer and patent attorney, his mother a psychiatrist—he attended Harvard, where he studied biology and cofounded StudentBusinesses.com, a website for student founders to pitch professional investors. A private charity reportedly bought the company in 2009 for an undisclosed sum. After graduating, Ramaswamy joined the hedge fund QVT, where he specialized in pharmaceutical investments. He earned $7 million in the first seven years of his career and made partner by 28. Around the same time, he met his now-wife, Apoorva, a throat surgeon. While continuing to work, he also managed to get a degree from America’s most prestigious law school, Yale. Ramaswamy left his job at QVT at 29 and, with the hedge fund backing him, started an investment holding company named Roivant Sciences. His thesis: Pharma giants had plenty of abandoned drugs that could be worth a fortune if someone focused on them. One year after founding the company, one of Roivant’s spinoffs, named Axovant, went public at a $2.2 billion valuation. Its prized asset: a much-hyped Alzheimer’s drug candidate, Intepirdine, which Ramaswamy had purchased for just $5 million. The year that Axovant joined the New York Stock Exchange, Ramaswamy reported more than $38 million of income, most of it from capital gains, on his tax return. Intepirdine turned out to be a disappointment, failing a clinical trial two years later. The company rebranded as Sio Gene Therapies in 2020 and is now worth about $30 million. But Ramaswamy had other drugs, too. In 2020, Japanese pharma giant Sumitomo Dainippon paid $3 billion to acquire five of them, as well as a 10% stake in Roivant. Ramaswamy got his second big windfall that year, reporting $176 million of income on his tax return, including $174.5 million in capital gains. Flush with cash, Ramaswamy stepped down from his company in January 2021, citing his “increasing public engagement” in a note to shareholders. He published his book seven months later and started the “anti-woke” asset management firm, Strive, around the same time. “We stand for this movement that we call ‘excellence capitalism,’ as a counterpart to stakeholder capitalism,” Ramaswamy explained on the Trillions podcast. “What excellence capitalism says is, focus exclusively on delivering excellent products and services to your customers, above all other agendas, including political and social agendas. And that’s different from stakeholder capitalism, which says you’re supposed to take into account 12 or 20 stakeholders at the same time.” A lineup of serious investors bankrolled Strive. Mega-donor Peter Thiel, who backed other “anti-woke” ventures like Rumble, put in some money. So did hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has invested heavily in the pharmaceutical industry and connected with Ramaswamy playing tennis. Joe Lonsdale, the 40-year-old cofounder of Palantir, chipped in, too. Despite all his money and connections, Ramaswamy looks pretty comfortable doing meet-and-greet politicking in New Hampshire. It helps, he says, that he doesn’t live like a tycoon. “I don’t think we have lived a lifestyle that is radically removed from the one we grew up in.” He owns two Ohio homes worth a combined $2.5 million, less than the real estate portfolios of far-less-wealthy candidates, including Nikki Haley, Francis Suarez, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Joe Biden. “We don’t have giant vacation homes,” Ramaswamy says. “We see five of our neighbors’ backyards. We have good relationships with our neighbors.” The exception, he concedes, is private air travel. He owns stakes in three private jets, which allows him to hop-scotch across the country and still make it back home to spend time with his wife and two young children in Ohio. “If we could buy time, we would buy time,” he says. “And that’s the only thing private aviation buys us. Time with family.” Voters seem to recognize that Ramaswamy inhabits a different stratosphere. In Milford, an older woman thanked him for visiting “us cow-town people” in New Hampshire. “Oh c’mon,” the billionaire presidential candidate responded, looking a little embarrassed. “I’m one of you.” He’s not, of course. Which is part of the appeal.

In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year. And that’s not all we have in store for Classic World of Warcraft. We’re pleased to announce that Mists of Pandaria Classic will be arriving in the summer of 2025, taking players back to the shores of Pandaria and bringing its legendary class design, incredible raids and dungeons, stunning environments, and (of course) an unforgettable soundtrack. Relive the World of Warcraft Classic experience with all-new fresh realms in the WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition arriving November 21. Join players on a whole new journey to level 60, with the first raid dungeon, Molten Core, becoming available a few weeks after launch. Choose to play on a PvP realm, a Normal PvE realm, or (for the very first time) a Hardcore realm progressing through content with the other realms — all from the beginning, with fresh economies, on very large realms. These realms will launch with some of the quality-of-life features that came later in the WoW Classic cycle, such as the Chronoboon Displacer to save your world buffs and the improved PvP Honor Ranking system. The PvP and Normal PvE realms will also progress into Burning Crusade Classic! It's never too late to go back and re-experience World of Warcraft anew—just in time to celebrate 20 years of adventures in Azeroth! The first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga kicked off in August with the launch of The War Within, bringing with it myriad new experiences with a new raid, dungeons, delves, PvP, new appearances and rewards, pets, mounts and much more. On the horizon, our next content update, Siren Isle, is currently available on the Public Test Realms (PTR), and the update will go live next month with a little something for everyone. This update also includes the epilogue questline for Dalaran and the Kirin Tor. No spoilers, but the storyline will feature the mysterious haranir, who also starred in the expansion release cinematic. The Siren Isle introduces a new outdoor environment to explore, full of mysteries to uncover and rewards to help catch your alternate characters up and prepare for the next War Within season ahead. Plunderstorm is returning with a new Plunderstore to provide more flexibility for earning rewards instead of a linear Renown track. There are also some quality-of-life changes to spell interactions, the UI and more ahead. The Siren Isle content update also brings with it Turbulent Timeways once more and additional updates to the Feast of Winter Veil in-game holiday event. We’re introducing a new novella that explores more of the story behind the scenes. Find out what happened with Jaina and Thrall after the Fall of Dalaran as they seek out reinforcements in this five-chapter special— available today and as read by Chris Metzen! Listen and read here. Xal’atath’s trail leads adventurers to a location in our next major content update that has long been known about but, as yet, remained unexplored—the Undermine. Players will travel deep into the goblin city of Undermine, the capital of the goblin’s trade empire! It is a city like none other seen before in World of Warcraft and stands as a testament to goblin intelligence and creativity as experts in both technology and alchemy. As our adventures continue, we’ll learn more about goblin culture and society that we have never been able to see before. We’ll learn what’s important to them, the problems they are trying to solve —everything that makes them truly unique, and what they’re capable of as a society. We’ll dig a bit deeper beyond just their humor and explosions, though there will still be explosions and a LOT of mayhem to be found. You’ll arrive in an Undermine that’s in conflict between the four major goblin cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company. Each cartel is run by notorious goblins like Monte Gazlowe, Renzik “The Shiv,” Baron Revilgaz, Marin Noggenfogger, and more. Which one you align yourself with is up to you. You’ll want to make sure you have a sweet ride to roll around town in— players can earn a customizable vehicle early on that’s designed just for use in Undermine. You’ll push the boundaries of locomotion on the roads of Undermine and speed through its causeways and byways at a higher rate than a ground mount can. Players can adjust the car’s driving characteristics by adding a little extra grip to hug the roads or adjust to slide and glide as they drift around corners. Want to accelerate faster? Then, you may have to sacrifice a little speed. How you customize your car’s characteristics is up to you. The new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, builds on the narrative of Undermine as players race to stop a group of goblins from blowing a dam that will bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This new dungeon will be available immediately as a part of the new The War Within Season 2 dungeon pool on Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic+, alongside the four other launch dungeons and three legacy dungeons. We’ll share more information on the full slate of dungeons at a later point, but we would be remiss if we didn’t include MOTHERLODE from Battle for Azeroth in the rotation. Players will also experience two new Delves and variations of existing Delves in the content update. Seasonal updates are also being introduced to Brann Bronzebeard, a new adversary to follow, Zek’vir, and a new set of goblin-inspired Curios. Experience a new 8-boss raid dungeon that takes you through the city streets and into the magnificent Gallagio— brimming with color and extravagance, it houses the dark secrets of its owner— Gallywix. There’s more at play here than it first seems, and goblin politics are treacherous and fraught with the underpinnings of something more where Xal’atath is concerned. There’s even more ahead in 2025, and we have the roadmaps to help guide you on what you can look forward to in World of Warcraft and WoW Classic. Thank you for making Azeroth your home over these last two decades. Speaking of home, the World of Warcraft team has one last thing to share with you… And yes, in World of Warcraft: Midnight, your next adventure begins at home. A house to call your very own. Stay tuned! Wherever your gaming experience takes you, we can’t wait to continue on this journey with you all. Lok’tar ogar! We’ll see you at the Inn, in Azeroth, and wherever the road takes us all next!

It’s a big year for the Warcraft universe, and whether you’re a Hearthstone fan, you’ve joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you’re a World of Warcraft player, there’s something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream. Join us for a celebration as we dip into the mana pool of nostalgia and cast far sight on the future of all things Warcraft. Viewers can watch on any Warcraft, Hearthstone, or Warcraft Rumble stream on Twitch or TikTok to earn rewards during the giveaway period from November 13 at 10:00 am PST through December 11 at 10:00 am PST. Learn more in our previously published article. We’ve rounded up everything you need to know from the Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct here. Jump directly to each section to learn more: Warcraft RTS, Hearthstone, Warcraft Rumble, World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Classic, World of Warcraft: The War Within. It’s been 30 years since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans made its debut, setting the path for so many stories and adventures that have come after. To continue these adventures in the Warcraft series, we’ve released Patch 2.0— now available for all Warcraft III: Reforged players. The patch overhauls environments, lighting, and the user interface. It also introduces uprezzed classic Warcraft III assets to HD, allowing players to choose and customize their graphical experience. Mix and match assets as you wish. There are also new quality-of-life improvements such as in-game hotkey customization, updated ladder, and much much more. Beyond the update for Warcraft III: Reforged, we’re happy to announce the release of fully remastered versions of Warcraft I and Warcraft II, taking you beyond Orcs and Humans, the Tides of Darkness, and the Dark Portal for the first time, again. Players will be able to switch between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time. We’ve also added more modern controls to Warcraft I, such as right-click move, band box select, and faster game speed. Both Warcraft I and II also have UI and UX improvements, such as tooltips and health bars, a mission select screen, and increased unit selection. Warcraft II will continue to have multiplayer functionality, and all legacy custom maps will remain fully compatible and playable. Travel back in time to experience each of these titles once more or— for the very first time— by visiting the shop: Warcraft I: Remastered, Warcraft II: Remastered, Warcraft III: Reforged. You’ll never forget the first time you hear “zug zug.” We’ve also brought back the Battle Chest, allowing players to purchase all three games in one bundle. For those who already purchased Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft®: II Battle.net® edition, or Warcraft III: Reforged from the Battle.net shop, the bundle will be available at a discount. Early next year, Hearthstone is going beyond Warcraft and into... Heroes of StarCraft! This special Mini-Set will have a whopping 49 new cards across three themed factions, which show what the StarCraft universe would look like in the Hearthstone Tavern. Each faction is made up of cards that can be used across multiple classes, including an iconic Hero card. Zerg Death Knight, Demon Hunter, Hunter, and Warlock have joined the Zerg! Led by the formidable Sarah Kerrigan, they will have aggressive cards that win the game by swarming the board. Protoss Druid, Mage, Priest, and Rogue fight for the Protoss Empire. Led by the High Templar Artanis, they will have powerful, high-cost cards that are made cheaper throughout the game. Terran Paladin, Shaman, and Warrior make up the Terran forces, lead by the one and only Jim Raynor. They will command Battlecruisers—a special take on the Starship mechanic from The Great Dark Beyond. The Mini-Set will feature a slew of StarCraft units which are sure to invoke nostalgia, as well as the Terran-armored Murloc, Grunty, and new, thematic music. You can chart a course for the Heroes of StarCraft Mini-Set, launching in January 2025! More announcements, details, and card reveals are coming closer to launch. Then, for the first time in 10 years, Arena Mode is getting a major overhaul. With that update, there will be two kinds of Arena to choose from. Normal Arena will be shorter form, allowing you to complete your runs more quickly. Competitive Arena players will be able to play in the higher-stakes Underground Arena, with longer runs and a new feature: Re-Draft on Loss. Re-Draft on Loss means that, after you lose, you’ll have the option to re-draft cards, edit your deck, and keep your run alive. Ratings will also be added to both Normal and Underground Arena. Normal, skill-based matchmaking will be used for Normal Arena. Underground Arena throws caution to the wind and lets you face off against opponents of all skill levels. This major Arena revamp is coming in the first half of next year. Look out for more details about this update closer to when it goes live. On top of those updates, Hearthstone has an exciting year of expansions ahead, with much-requested themes, locations, and familiar faces across Azeroth. In the first expansion of the year, enter the Emerald Dream and join the battle between the Old Gods and the Druids of the Emerald Dream for the fate of the World Tree. Things will heat up even more when the Druids of the Flame light up the Mini-Set (releasing earlier than normal this year, during the 32.2 Patch). The second expansion of the year will be Hearthstone’s first-ever sequel: the return to Un’Goro Crater! Join Elise on a hunt for a mythical, lost Tortollan city. When you find it, join the Tortollans in a festival to celebrate the mighty dinosaurs of the crater in the 33.4 Mini-Set. In the third expansion of the year, travel with Chromie through alternate realities to recruit Legendary Warcraft heroes like you’ve never seen them before. Leading to the 34.4 Mini-Set: an epic showdown against Murozond at the end of time! It’s been one year since Warcraft Rumble went live. To celebrate, players can log in to Warcraft Rumble today and join the one-year anniversary celebration in game. Players can collect daily rewards, including new avatars and cosmetics! The Warcraft universe is built on rich and diverse characters that may not fit into any singular family, and because of this, we’re introducing split Leaders! In Season 10, we reintroduce Sylvanas Windrunner as the first playable split Leader, honoring her allegiance to both the Horde and Undead families. Later, we will introduce Malfurion Stormrage as Alliance and Cenarion, Orgrim Doomhammer as Horde and Blackrock, and last but not least, Anub’arak as Undead and Beast. Warcraft Rumble is coming to PC! The PC beta will launch on December 10, 2024; stay tuned for more information! World of Warcraft celebrates 20 years of adventure in Azeroth, bringing together players of all ages and abilities from all over the world, making connections both in the game and out. Inspired by the incredible story captured in “The Remarkable Life of Ibelin” documentary about Mats “Ibelin” Steen—now live on Netflix— a Norwegian WoW® player who suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, you can add the Reven Pack to your collection and support CureDuchenne, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving and extending the lives of those affected by this disease. Live now in modern World of Warcraft, players can join the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration to collect updated Tier 2 armor appearance sets, undertake Classic Timewalking, engage with others to defeat iconic world bosses, head to the Trading post, and earn iconic new rewards, and more. The War Within has taken the leap into the first chapter of the Worldsoul Saga and adventures continue in WoW Classic, but this is only the beginning of what we have planned. Currently, in Season of Discovery, players are exploring new adventures with new class abilities, all-new level-up raids, finding secrets, and teaming up to defeat Ragnaros and Nefarian. It won’t be long until everyone can join the War Effort and open the gates to Ahn’Qiraj, where they’ll get to plunder the depths for new rewards and face new challenges. After Ahn’Qiraj, players in Season of Discovery can look forward to one more phase, in which they’ll face the dangers of Naxxramas, along with new instanced content featuring the Scarlet Crusade as well as adventures in Deadwind Pass! In Cataclysm Classic, Ragnaros has risen in the Firelands once more, and players are working toward adding the Dragonwrath Staff to their collection. In the final phase of Cataclysm Classic, players will experience the Hour of Twilight patch and Dragon Soul raid dungeon early next year.
