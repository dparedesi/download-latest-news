Jeff Barber 0:00Hey everybody, welcome to the Singletracks podcast. I’m your host, Jeff Barber, and today we’re speaking with someone who’s carved out a unique niche in the bike industry by going against the grain, from his brash and unconventional approach to bikes to his knack for creating one of a kind accessories miles from Mullet Cycles has been challenging industry norms. For years, he’s dedicated himself to perfecting the mixed wheel format for mountain bikes, and he’s also the creative force behind miles wide industries which offers clever rider focused accessories. Today we’ll talk about his path into the cycling world, why he’s sticking with mixed wheel setups and what’s next for his two companies. Thanks for joining me Miles. Miles 0:43Hey. Thanks for having me, sir. Jeff Barber 0:47Well, you you’ve had a pretty colorful and eclectic background before starting mullet cycles. Tell us a little bit about your previous career and how you made the leap into the bike industry. Miles 0:59I did like a mountain bike summer camp, and I was 13 and got altitude sickness, and had a blast, made a bunch of cool friends. Um, I’m from New York, so I was, I went out to Colorado for this camp, and I broke a bunch of stuff on my bike. And was like, I want to work at a bike shop so I can get this kind of stuff. Jeff Barber 1:28Were you living in the city at the time, New York City? Miles 1:31I was actually living just outside the city. So a lot of people don’t know Brooklyn Queens is on Long Island, and then you have Nassau County, Suffolk County, it’s a pretty big island, so I was actually on the island about 10 miles outside of Manhattan. Jeff Barber 1:53And there’s mountain bike trails on Long Island, but it’s not like the first place people think of when they think of mountain biking. Miles 2:01No, they, they definitely don’t. I was most more of escaped skater. You know, I’d wear the Janko jeans, and I would go to the Brooklyn banks and kind of hanging out with bad crowd. One of my friends, older brother, had a mountain bike, and my friend’s parents and my parents spoke, and they’re like, Yeah, you should send them off, you know, get them a mountain bike and send them off to camp. So because I was, I was kind of becoming a bad boy. So, yeah, that’s, I guess, you know, lucky for me for having that friend and having his older brother that that’s kind of like, you know, I was, I didn’t know what a mountain bike was. It that I knew what a BMX bike was so but yeah, there were trails out in Long Island. My first time mountain biking ever was in Colorado, in Silverton on this camp. So before that, it was like, at this, you know, small walking park behind my neighborhood. So I really didn’t even know what mountain bike it was until I got out there. When I got out there, I was like, Oh, my God. Jeff Barber 3:19Like, there’s mountains in mountain biking, Miles 3:22Yeah, exactly I was, you know, and that’s why I got altitude sickness, because I was at sea level my entire life, you know, and I didn’t want to be at the back of the pack, so I was just really pushing myself hard. So I ended up working at this bike shop called Bike Works in Greenville, Long Island and small bike shop, and he wouldn’t pay me because I was like, 13, but I was like, I’ll just work for parts. I’ll clean the shop. I just want to learn everything about bikes, how to work on my bike. And, I mean, kind of like, long story short, on that, and I ended up working there till I was, like 26 even when I started other companies on my own, it was just kind of became like a second dad to me, in a lot of ways, the owner, it would just be me and him in there. So, you know, I would just constantly pick his brain with stuff. And then I ended up kind of running the shop. And then when I started my companies, you know, yeah, I would work there, like on Sundays, just as a bit of therapy. So I really working at the shop. I never wanted to get into the bike industry. I just, I saw how competitive it was, plus we carried specialized in track, which is really rare. Um, he kind of got, like, grandfather, yeah. 90s. He opened up, I want to say, like in the late 70s, okay, early 80s. So he got those brands, like when they were, you know, kind of starting out. And, yeah, it was just there. There was so much good stuff out there, and it was just so competitive. And I just was like, well, you really can’t make money in this industry. Jeff Barber 5:27And, yeah, and so I know a little bit about your story. I mean, yeah, kind of fast forward through. And you know, you worked in jewelry design, you had some of your own companies. So how did you get like, back? Like, what brought you back to say, You know what, I’m gonna, like, start a bike company. How did, how did Mullet Cycles officially get its start? Miles 5:52Well, it again. It was kind of organic. While I was working at that shop, I had started a personal lubricant company, which, you know, ended up being very successful, and we had a customer come into the shop and asked, if you know her, that I made that product, and wanted to pick my brain about it, just like I got a product that I would like to make with you and that I had a bunch of kind of time on my hands because I had, like, a warehouse distributor, it was all pretty just up and up and running. I got into some major retailers such as CVS, with it. So what he had was he was on, like a race, a road bike race team, and they all use Ziploc bags in their bicycle jersey. And he was like, we should make a neoprene bag that has a bunch of compartments to hold all your tools, and we can stick that in our bike jersey. I was a mountain biker. Road biking was pretty dangerous in the metropolitan area. I would sometimes, yeah, you know, people a wife, a widow, would bring in a bike that I had worked on. So, you know, my husband got hit by a car. I don’t know what. I don’t want to see this anymore, you know, part it out and sell the parts, or whatever you want to do with it, you know, after, like, insurance and everything. So I wasn’t that into it, but he was a really cool guy. He actually worked for Blackstone or Blackrock at one of the big investment companies, BlackRock, yeah, one of the big Yep, he actually did their software and stuff for, I guess, trading. He tried to explain it to me that that my brain doesn’t work like that, but he was a really cool guy, like, you just look cool, and he had a swagger. And I was like, Yeah, you know, like, I wanted to pick his brain. And anyway, ended up making that. And, you know, I just kind of made it to make it. It was like a fun little project. I learned he before he started that he was doing clothes, so he knew how to sew. And so I would go over to his flat in Brooklyn and taught me how to sew, and I got materials in the garment district in Manhattan. And it was kind of like, you know, it was like this little side project that was just fun for me. I kind of got sick of New York. I moved to Asheville and Tyler Benedict, a bike groomer, did a review on this sticky pod, which I don’t know how he got his hands on one, because we’re just selling them through the bike shop. Jeff Barber 9:02No PR person reaching out. Miles 9:06No. And I we had, like, oh, he built a website, like a one page website, and, you know, I would maybe send out, like, five a month, uh, mostly in the northeast area. And so I opened up my paypal and it was just like, Dude, there’s like 15k in there, like overnight. And after just having like a few 100 in the sticky pod PayPal, and I was like, Holy crap, my my website got hacked or something. I ended up googling it was on bike. Rumor opened up my inbox so that there were like distributors in there that wanted to carry it, and all this stuff. At that point, I had sold my lubricant company, um. Um, so I was like, Okay, I’ll start making this stuff, you know, okay, I’ll and I had distributors asking me, what other products you make. So I started just developing a product line of products that I wanted but nobody else is making. So, like, I made the grips for brake levers. I made a shock stiction lube. I made, like, this bottle pod, which was an organizer for, like, it was just basically a bottle that had compartments in there, and you could put in your water bottle cage, because, again, my jersey. So I really didn’t use a sticky pod, like, I would just use it as, like a little thing in my car for stuff. Jeff Barber 10:46So a pencil case. Miles 10:48Right, a yellow pencil case. After Asheville, I moved to Colorado. I just wanted bigger mountains, and I always had a love for Colorado. After riding there, when I was in my ute, I would do that summer camp, like every year. So I ended up being like a counselor on that on that camp. And so I had experience all over the West Coast and like my teenage years, which is great. Okay, yeah, so when I moved to Colorado, I visited a bunch of bike shops and asked, you know, told them, hey, I’m in Colorado. These are some of my products. If you’d like, you can get them through like BTi, JBI, and it was also a way to make some new friends in the area. You know, some of the, some of the mechanics I want some riding buddies. One of the shops, Timberline cycles was a foes dealer, and I was my personal bike was a foes and I’d always been a big foes fan. And a foes dealer is really rare. So I wanted to, you know, talk to him about bikes and show him my stuff. He was closing his shop. I kept leaving voicemails. He ended up finally calling me back, and he was like, hey, you know, I’m closing up the shop, and, you know, I got your voicemails, you know, yeah, if you’d like to come in and talk about bikes, you know, sure, so we scheduled a day, got into talking, and he basically was, had dropped off his friends. He was the he basically came to Brent with this idea of a mixed wheel bike, Jeff Barber 12:45And who was the who was the owner of the shop? What was his name? Miles 12:48Mike Vidovich, okay, and he, before he opened that shop, he it was a dirt bike shop. So he carried Gas, gas. And before that, he managed one of the biggest bike shops in the springs, pro pro cycling. Jeff Barber 13:14Yeah. Miles 13:15So yeah, he ended up opening up a dirt bike shop Spain kind of had their recession after hours. This is like 2012 so he couldn’t get dirt bikes anymore. And his employees are like, Why don’t you just carry mountain bikes? Since you know mountain bikes very well, you have a Racetech suspension degree. You were the, you know, you would rebuild the shocks at your shop. And he was a great mechanic, and so he carried a bunch of different brands that had, like, all different suspension designs, basically. So he carried single pivot or DW. When he got the 275 wheel, which was like two or ended 2012 he still had some dirt bikes in his shop. And he was like, hmm, you know, this is kind of like the golden ratio. He had, like, he carried, like Ventana, and they had a 69 ER, so they had a 29 front 26 reader as well as Moots did as well. And he felt that the ratio was just too big a part. And he thought, like the 275 was kind of like the Goldilocks. So he started throwing those wheels on his 29 inch wheel bikes that he sold. And was like, well, and he had some really fast riders. He had one guy, Tucker, who won state championships downhill. He was like, well, there, I need to do things to the geometry in order to really get this correct. And so he contacted a couple of companies that he was carrying and say, Hey, would you be cool? Of maybe making a mixed real bike. And they all said, No, you know, it’s kind of like a fad. It’s been done before. And so he ended up reaching out to foes. Who would you carry? Carried single pivot? And he basically said, if you purchase like, 25 frames, yeah, I’ll do it for you. Okay, they kind of, you know, so Mike went out to Pasadena, which is where they were located at the time, and, you know, stayed with Brent and told him what he wanted. Worked it worked at the shop with him. Told him the geometry and stuff like that. Help pay. You know, Mike had to pay for, like the marketing. So he did a video, paid half the booth for inner bike in 2015 which is when they released it. And I was actually, I had a booth at that show under the miles of my my little trinkets product. So I had actually met like at that show, because I want to go to the foe’s booth. So the new mixer model, and I was like, to me, it just looked really ugly. And I had experience on the big hit back in the day when I used to race in the Norbu series, and they would come through ski platichill in New York, and I got hurt really bad on that, and the 24 inch wheel just had no right being on a downfall course, I Guess, got hung up and, like, launched like Superman, couple a couple of feet, and then boom, and I was concussed and broke a bunch of stuff. So anyway, so getting back to, you know, my kind of telling me, and now, and I told him that, he was like, Well, have you ever, you know, ridden one of these, you know, I know you’re a fan of this brand. And I was like, No. He was like, Well, why don’t you take one out and ride one? So he set one up for me, and I that day, I The shop was really close to Red Rock open space, so I just pedaled from the shop to the trails. And he told me to put my Strava on. And I really didn’t take it serious. I was just kind of riding the bike, and I ended up, Ko, I made, like, two sections, and, oh, wow, without really even trying. And I was like, This doesn’t make sense. And I ended up. So I went back to the shop and, like, I PR at every, every, every segment. I went back to the shop, and I was like, you know, something doesn’t make sense here. Can I take out again? And he was like, Sure. So I took it on section 16, which is more of an enduro trail, and I PR my climbing Kom, another segment, and my PRs were so much faster. And he’s like, you know, and I and he, when I went back to the shop again, I was like, Yeah, this is fast, man. It’s actually better. And he was just laughing. And he’s like, I told you, I told you, it’s the future. And I was like, How come nobody else is doing this? And he said, Well, you know, I called some companies, asked him to make them. They said it was gimmicky, and they’re also banned to race on. You can’t race on these on a mixed wheel bike. Jeff Barber 18:39Okay, yeah. Miles 18:41So you know, was like, Well, why don’t we make it basically, you, you know, understand the geometry. No one’s really doing this. You have Foes. And then I did some research. You had foes and you had light bill. It’s German company. They were the only two that offered them. And, you know, I was like, both of these bikes are pretty ugly. It just my opinion. Eye of the beholder. I was like, let’s make them. Jeff Barber 19:16Because Foes was, Foes was, like, a pretty small brand. Miles 19:19Back then. Yeah, still, still, you know, pretty small, yeah. Jeff Barber 19:24And they were making the bikes. Were they making them in the US? They were like, yeah. And as I recall, they were, they looked pretty, like basic, kind of, like, garage build, yes, Miles 19:34Yeah, yeah. You know, they have always kind of, like, some like, when I would ride it, they would, I would get made fun of. They’re like, You look like a photo riding that thing, yeah? And I would just be like, well, you know, made in the USA, and I don’t need, I just need a single pivot, you know, you need all these linkages, yeah? And you’re not even as fast as me, so, ah. But, yeah, you know, like, I didn’t want to get what he had made with with foes, and I didn’t want to get the light bill because that bike was just It looked very unsafe. And so yeah, look, no one’s doing this. Let’s, let’s do it. I think I could, you know, I think I could figure out how to get a maid and and I also wanted to help him, you know, I felt kind of bad after hearing his story. I’m a bit of an empath, so I get happy from other people’s happiness. And, yeah, he was like, All right, so we’re going to meet every day, and we’re going to develop a business plan, and it’s going to be like a marriage. And so my creative side just instantly, like, I’ll never forget, like, our first launch the next day was I had, like, a list of names. And he was like, you know, we got a lot of steps before we’re thinking of names. And I was like, Yeah, but, you know, I want to call it something and and that gets to the name Mullen, which obviously has become a very popular name to identify a mixed wheel bike. When I, when I had come up with the name, obviously. Well, Mike hated the name. I had made some friends in the industry, like Clint Spiegel, owner of I nine. He their shop was like a mile down the road when I was living in Asheville, and he wanted to meet me hear about my adult escapade. It’s funny, a lot of people always just want to hear about that. That’s like, always very interesting. Jeff Barber 22:14Yeah, yeah. Miles 22:19So I texted him, and was like, Oh, what do you think of this name? And Clint was like, I hate it, you know, it’s trashy. I was, you know, I asked him. I’m like, Well, I asked some of the guys at, you know that, at the shop that worked there, and and I asked Tyler Benedict, the owner of Bike groomer. And, you know, I had reached out to him after he did the sticky pot, and I was like, Hey, thanks, man, and yeah, and he loved it. He thought it was great. So I convinced Mike. I was like, Yeah, this is going to be the name, trust me, it’s great. It’s catchy, and, like, there needs to be, like, a funky name, and, you know, for a bike company, because a lot of the names just have always been so generic, or you didn’t know what it was, you know, I don’t want to mention names, but yeah, yeah. Jeff Barber 23:21And, I mean, it’s kind of like, it’s like, Niner, right? Like, Niner, like, you knew what they were doing, I mean, until they stopped just making 29ers. Miles 23:30Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it was pretty edgy, you know, because everyone would just automatically think of the hair, you know. And just like, right? Some, you know, like burly dudes that just don’t give a f, you know. So, and then obviously, you know, people would ask me, Why are you calling it mullet? And I would tell them, this is in the front party in the back. And they would, you know, and they would laugh, it’s hilarious. So I did some research, making sure that the name wasn’t in use at all. You know, all the URLs were available, mulletbike, DotCom, walletcycles, DotCom, mullet bicycle, DotCom, so I bought all of them and made sure that no one had a trademark on it. And what I found was trek actually had the trademark on Mullet. Jeff Barber 24:32Trek had a bike when they did their 96 er, is that what their bike was? Well, 69 or always get it mixed up. Miles 24:39Yes, 69er, and this is where it gets, kind of like, Huh? They had, they owned Gary Fisher, and Gary Fisher had a 26er called the mullet. And that the Gary Fisher Mullet. It was like a. I don’t know what it was. I guess it was like a jump, jump 26 inch bike, because mullet is also a fish as well. And Gary Fisher would a lot of time use fish for, you know, he kind of like had a fish fetish. But, yeah, Jeff Barber 25:18I thought he was into the Grateful Dead. Miles 25:22That too. He’s into a lot of cool stuff. I mean, let’s be honest, yeah, he’s a very, very eccentric individual. Speaker 1 25:31Yeah. Miles 25:33So Trek had the trademark on Mllet, but they didn’t use it when they came out with their 69er, they just called it a 69 which was a 29 front, 26 rear. They didn’t use that trademark. Jeff Barber 25:49Good name too. I mean, depending, it’s a little little on the nose, but, Miles 25:53Yeah, yeah, a little edgy, especially for track, yeah. But yeah it was a great way to, you know, let people know that it was a mixed wheel bike, or a Franken bike, as we kind of used to call them, like when I had my big hit. We called it a Franken bike because they took a they had a big hit, a 26 or big hit, and then they had the 24 26 big hit, which, so we would call that a 46er, okay, or, or Franken bike. So, yeah, it was, it was, you know, surprising to me. I mean, not really, but I guess in hindsight, surprising to me, that Trek didn’t call the 69er a mullet. Since that firm has gained so much traction, and when I would Google search for mullet, the only thing that came up was like a cycle cross coffee club in San Francisco. I guess they call themselves, like the bullet riders. Jeff Barber 27:07And yeah, vaguely related. Miles 27:11And that the rest everything on Google was just about haircuts and stuff. So I was like, Okay, I think this name’s been the table. Jeff Barber 27:20I guess there was a thing I thought I heard too. There was, like a gearing thing, where people called, like, certain type of gearing, a mullet setup or something, but had nothing to do with the wheels, correct? Miles 27:31Yeah, that actually came in quite a bit later, as far as referring it to mullet, okay, and SRAM was the one that was doing that. They started doing that like in 2019, 2020, after like, after mullet, all of a sudden became a thing of business in the front party, like, let’s mix everything together. And I actually reached out, yeah, everything’s a mullet now, so I reached out to SRAM and said, hey, you know, I have a trademark on mullet. Can you, you know, maybe not call it a mullet. So now they call it the adventure build or something. I’m bigger. They could have come up with something more creative than that, but, yeah, but yeah, so that’s the thing now, yes. Jeff Barber 28:23And so, right? So you you were able to get this trademark, yeah? And obviously, it’s the name of of your business. And you want to make it clear that, yeah, when somebody’s saying a mullet bike, like, you know, they could be confused. Are you talking about Mullet the brand? Are you using it in this other way? And so, yeah, do you think that’s like, has that made it tougher for you, or has it helped you? Like, what do you? What do you? Kind of the strategy behind it now, right, right. Miles 28:51I mean, when it was happening, like, basically the UCI changed their rules to allow mixed wheels for the 2019, season. And so a lot of media groups made, you know, it was a pretty big deal, and they first started calling it mismatched. Number of people, obviously, you know, they’re like, it’s the return of the Franken bike. Okay, yeah. And then, you know, couple comments was like, oh, it’s the mullet. And everyone loved that, because it’s, it’s cool, it’s catchy, yeah, for sure. When that happened, I was obviously spoke to a couple people. You know, what should I do here? I would say it was like 8020 80% of them were like, Oh, it’s great for you. You should, you know, totally run with it. It’s going to bring more eyes onto you, because you’re the original mullet. I mean, we were out for sorry, i. We’re out for like, a couple of years already, to that point, like, we had started in 2017 so, you know. And I had the URL so people like, you know, when they’re Googling it, you’re gonna pop up and then, you know, I had us right. Really, really, just two people. They’re like, you know, you should probably change it. I had done a lot of work, invested a decent amount of money, you know, on the trademark, designing the head badges, getting them casted by my jeweler, the font, building the website. And I was like, Ah, he and I was like, that’s, that’s what this is, you know? I was like, this is, this is a mullet. This is, yeah, this is my bike. So, you know, sometimes it’s something I do battle with. I, you know, companies started calling the mullet, and I’d have to reach out, you know, just to try to protect my brand as best as I could without suing everybody, because I didn’t want to sue everybody I, you know, again, we carried specialized and that was kind of specialized tactic. And I always thought that that was, you know, dirty. It just wasn’t a good way to grow the bike industry, you know, like with enduro, for instance, and the Specialized Enduro. Jeff Barber 31:30And the Roubaix. There’s a lot of examples, right? Miles 31:33Yeah, yeah. And they were going after, like, bike shops and stuff. And, you know, enduro became, like a whole sect of discipline and riding, so I didn’t want to do that. So I just, you know, it’s all bike companies. You know, you probably don’t know I exist. I’m small, but, you know, have this trademark. Can you please not call it that? So they called it MX, which is why you see a lot of companies called MX. So that’s kind of Yeah, you know, I I didn’t make these bikes to sell a ton, to make friends, to be cool. I just made them because I wanted a better bike for myself. And there were certain things on the bike that I wanted, such as three, oh, tires I like a really big chain ring. I was like a runner back in high school, and I didn’t want to be able to run faster than I can pedal. And yeah, with a 38 two chainring and a 52 cassette, I’d be able to climb anything. And then when it came to descending, I’d be pedaling past people, and they’re in their tuck, you know, if we’re on the fire road, or if I’m on like, a long, descending single track, I can still keep my speed up without just pedaling out. And yeah, people weren’t offering that. So, yeah. Jeff Barber 33:09So talk about what makes a Mullet Cycles bike different from other mixed wheel bikes. You know, obviously when you first started out, there weren’t a lot of choices. I mean, sounds like there were two, maybe, yeah, now seems like everybody’s got a mixed wheel bike. So what? What makes mullet cycles bike different from from all the other ones that are on the market? Miles 33:30So this kind of, I would say, the geometry, the geometry is, is the big deal with it, which is why I don’t publish it. When we were building out prototypes, I still had, like, a vision of certain numbers. I was like, and I, I need the head angle to be this. I need, I need the bottom bracket to be here. And Mike was pretty adamant. He was like, Look, if you want to make a bunch of prototypes, go ahead and time test them and you know, see, see what’s going to be the best. So I made, like, over a dozen prototypes, ranging from like head angles, from 62 like all the way up to 68 different bottom bracket heights, different seat angles, different chain stay lengths. And over the course of almost a year, I would ride like sometimes three times a day on section 16, which in that trail in the springs, kind of has everything they have dumbed it down. It’s not as chunky as it used to be, but had really steep switchbacks. Jeff Barber 34:53 I remember riding it when I lived there for sure. Miles 34:57Oh, okay, so yes, you’re familiar with. It, yeah, that’s, I felt like that was a great proving ground. Jeff Barber 35:05Sad that they dumbed it down. It was definitely a challenging trail. Miles 35:09Yeah, a lot of people got hurt. So, you know, what are you gonna do? I guess the town just didn’t want to get sued, or, who knows. So when I was time testing and everything like there was. I remember one prototype that just felt really fast, but it just wasn’t the fastest on Strava. And one particular was consistently the fastest on climbing and descending. And again. Long story short, this was the this was, this was the geometry. And it wasn’t what, at that time, modern geometry, you know, you had long, low, Slack it. It didn’t follow those guidelines at all. And, you know, the difference between a bike from the 90s versus one today is geometry you can put, like great suspension, great brakes on a bike from the late 90s, it’s still going to feel very unstable and ultimately slow. So like, yeah, you know, dirt bikes get their speed out of motors. We kind of get our speed out of geometry, like a modern hardtail with modern geometry symmetrical wheel or safety bike will be faster than a downhaul bike from the late 90s, and what’s his name, did a test. Kyle Warner did a YouTube video on that with his Niner hardtail versus like a retro downhill bike, and the hardtail ended up being faster. So with mixed wheels, I do, you know, there were things that you’re able to do that you couldn’t really get away with on a symmetrical wheel bike, or 29 or 275 or platform, and you know, it’s still something I kind of struggle with, because I would love to share the geometry, but at the same time, people would see the geometry and probably say, I can’t that. I can’t ride that on my trails. It’s, you know, I’ll get hurt. Jeff Barber 37:40Yeah. Yeah. I mean, is it like, I know you won’t, you won’t share the numbers, but yeah, I guess you’re saying it would be surprising to people, or shocking, or they’d be like, Whoa, that number is ridiculously high or ridiculously low. That couldn’t possibly work. Miles 37:55Okay, yes, yes, because I, have, you know, told some of my friends, and they’re like, that makes no sense, you know, like, after they ride the bike, and they’re like, Okay, yeah, it’s fast, oh yeah, you know, they open up their Strava and they got a bunch of PRs, and they’re like, Okay, please tell me. And I tell them, they’re like, that doesn’t make sense. So, you know, released into Geometry, people would look at me and be like, they don’t know what they’re doing. And then specialized, or one of these big box brands would do it, and then it would be okay, you know, kind of like, you know, specialized in Loic Bruni, you know, he was one of the first Jeff Barber 38:47You still haven’t seen, still haven’t seen those numbers from anybody that get close? Miles 38:53They’re still pretty far away. And now, okay, new trends have come with really steep seed angles, and now they’re going longer. Chain stays like the industry is always evolving geometry, and I firmly believe it will continue to evolve. It’s a great way for companies to sell you a new bike every year. It’s marketing, and marketing is a hell of a drug. And you get really fast riders that can be fast on anything, and they’re fast on this quote, unquote, newer geometry. And then everyone’s like, Oh, that’s what I need. So it’s like, I get it like, you know, like people want to know the geometry, and real writers want to know I totally understand, because I’m a real writer, and I don’t know if I. Would trust a company that wouldn’t release their geometry, because that’s just generally how you get a good idea of how the bike’s going to perform and behave on certain trails. So I you know it’s kind of like proprietary information. If you look at dirt bikes, which is a great example, most of them don’t release their geometry, and most of dirt bikes, their geometry hasn’t changed since the 90s. They took a lot of like the 70s and 80s, figuring out different wheel diameters and different geometry, and then they got, you know, 90s came, and they basically optimized it, and it really hasn’t altered off of that platform Since to this day. So that’s kind of like, and obviously they’re using mixed wheels as well. So I kind of, you know, look at it at that perspective, like it’s proprietary. It’s the blueprints of this bike. If I were to publish them, I would get, you know, there’s, like, a lot of these steel garage welders kind of thing, and they would do it and say, Holy smokes. And, you know, I don’t know, it’s like, Well, I came up with that. Jeff Barber 41:38So, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, it sets you apart for sure, and it’s the secret sauce, and it’s a little bit different, a little bit of mystery. And I’m sure people appreciate that. Maybe beyond the bikes, the designs that you know, the geometry, the technical secret sauce, the thing that strikes me when I look at mullet cycles, bikes, and like the one that I tested is they’re just, they’re beautiful bikes, the frame, the finishes, and then the build as well. And I know that you’ve worked exactly designer in the past, and so I’m curious, does that experience kind of carry over into your bike builds? Like, are you looking at these as if they’re like, a piece of jewelry? Miles 42:24I am a red blooded male. Like, I it’s, it’s got to look hot, if it’s not hot. Like, or, you know, I mean, the bikes, you know, when I go out on trails, a lot of people because they just don’t know the brand. I really don’t do a lot of advertising or marketing. It’s just, I just made the bikes. And if you want it, here you go. You want something that’s cool and fast and, you know, kind of reliable. This is it. But, yeah, I always had like an eye for things like, even when I had my foes, they would always be tricked out in such a way that, I mean, you know, they would look cool like I would, you know, my friends would make fun of me for it, because they could. But when I would go out, people be like, Oh, wow, that thing looks cool like I had my foes FXR at my booth in 2015 Interbike, and it was a real eye catcher, and people were coming up to it. I had, like, white wall tires and stuff, and a lot of purple, and it looked like a beach cruiser, but, yeah, cool. So, yeah, I made so many drawings of our bikes, like I have a book of probably 500 I mean, a lot of all different lines, and yet it had to be esthetically pleasing. Wow. And coincide, you know, with the geometry, and same with the single pivot, like single pivot generally look pretty old school, very basic. So trying to make, and then we used an elevated chain stay as well. So trying to make that look, in my opinion, and some people might think it’s ugly and it’s totally fine, in for me, it’s just a very, Jeff Barber 44:39Very good looking, yeah, it’s a challenge to make look cool. Miles 44:44Yeah, you need functional cool. And the elevated chainsack, I really didn’t want to do that was really like, Mike’s thing. And he explained to me, he’s like, look you. You want the big top. Tire. You want the big chain ring. The only way we’re going to be able to do this is if we do an elevated chainstack. And he was like, just make it look cool. He was like, that, you know, okay, you know, you worked as a wax model maker. You should be able to to make it look like art. And in my opinion, that I think they do. I think they look like jewelry. They’re gorgeous bikes in person. There’s so much, dare I say, prettier, Jeff Barber 45:35Yeah, lots of details that you don’t necessarily get from the photos. So one thing I noticed is you don’t offer any carbon fiber bikes, all aluminum, though you did also you’re bringing back a titanium version of the honeymaker. So yeah, why not carbon? Why? Why do you stick with metal bikes? Miles 45:55That’s a good question. I’ve always had bad experiences with carbon, I would just break them after I didn’t have a carbon bike for like, longer than, let’s say, five months before it would fail on me. So, oh geez, it was, it was definitely a topic with my manufacturer because of the lines that I wanted to do. I, you know, showed them my drawings of the tubes, and I was, I was wanted to do hydroforming, and they said, you know, it would be a lot less expensive if you went the carbon fiber route. Carbon fiber frames are actually really surprisingly inexpensive to manufacture, quite a bit less than my aluminum frames. It might come surprising to people. I do believe that might be why a lot of bike manufacturers are able to offer a lifetime warranty, because there’s they’re pretty inexpensive to make, but it’s carbon fiber. So people think, well, I should be spending a lot of money on this. I I believe that carbon is great for pavement. It’s really stiff, really light. And you know you want. You want something really stiff, that that gets all your power down, and for a full suspension, you want something right, that’s laterally stiff, so that rear triangle is just going on a vertical path, so it’s just it, it’s easier on the bearings, easier on the shock, and the bike will feel more plush than if that rear end is flexing. But again, I just, I had really bad experiences with it. A lot of the times I would break them, if I would crash the bike, would just kind of, I would walk back to the bike, and then I would, you know, I would inspect it, and I would see a hole in it because it hit a rock. Miles 48:06So for me, it, I liked aluminum. I mean, there’s obviously steel as well, which is another fabulous metal. It’s very strong. Obviously they make bridges out of it for full suspension. I I, I admire the power, or the strength to weight ratio that aluminum provides. It’s and when I’m climbing, I having something lighter, it’s just going to get me up the hill faster. So, right, yep, aluminum, I just felt was going to be the best material, at least for a full suspension bike. For the hardtail, we could have done steel. Our frames would have been a lot less expensive because it’s such an inexpensive material, and it’s also far easier to weld than aluminum. But again, I love speed. I kind of like a speed. All I want to do is just go fast. So having an aluminum frame, even a hardtail frame, was just going to be faster than a steel frame. And what’s great about steel is it is very compliant. So it does like to stretch and bend and flex. It likes it. That’s why like bridges again made of steel, so the bridge can flex train rails, steel. If you ever watch a train going over the rails, you can see the the wheels flexing the steel. Titanium offers a lot. Lot of similarities to steel with that compliance, but it kind of has like all the good, none of the bad, obviously, other than the price, it’s still pretty easy to well, but the material is far more expensive. However, it’s far lighter and it won’t rust or corrode. So all the bikes that I make I ride, yeah, right, it’s just an advantage. And I just all the bikes I ride, I just want to go fast. So, you know, would I sell more if I would make him in steel, probably, you know, steel is real. Is a great marketing term, but I wouldn’t be going as fast. Jeff Barber 50:52Well, speaking of going fast, your website teases a mixed wheel gravel slash adventure bike. So I’m curious about that bike. What’s the thinking behind a mullet gravel bike? And where are you kind of in that development process? Miles 51:07I believe that a symmetrical wheel bike. It’s based off the road bike platform mountain bikes being symmetrical. And also, like in the early days, it was basically road bike geometry. It was just using knobby tires. So I don’t, after diving into this mixed wheel hole that I have for almost 10 years, I look at a mixed wheel bike as the dirt bike platform. Your front axle sits higher than career axle, so it’s more difficult to go over the handlebars. And there are things that you can do on a dirt bike platform, as far as geometry that you just can’t do on the road bike platform, symmetrical wheels. Gravel bikes were going off road. You uh, going over the handlebar sucks. And I kind of got into gravel riding because, you know, I just enjoyed it. You can really put in a lot of miles and see certain places that you know, generally you might not see, at least on my mountain bike trails where I was living. So, yeah, I’ve went over the handlebars on a gravel bike a couple times, and I’ve, it’s said I need to make a gravel bike with a larger front wheel where my front axle is higher, because when you are running a larger front wheel, you’re basically lifting up on the handlebars almost an inch off the ground. Even when you’re obviously not, it’s just all the time like that. And when you come up to an obstacle or something that looks a little sketch that’s in the road, you lift up on the handlebars so and sometimes you don’t even see it, if it’s like a pothole, and you just got your head down. So by doing, by by running a larger front wheel, it just made the bike more stable off road. So figuring out the geometry, again, has been nothing short of a lot of work. Again, I made a bunch of prototypes. I’ve been working on it since 2019 so like six years almost, which is nuts, yeah, but it like it had to be perfect, and it had to be better. I just didn’t want to make a mixed wheel gravel bike and say, Oh, here’s the mixed wheel gravel bike. You should buy it like, because I ride it and it needed to impress me, and it needed to be faster than what I, you know, my road bike, platform gravel bike, my 700 C from rear it needed to be faster, both on climbing and obviously descending. I couldn’t just take the geometry for my hardtail and copy it. Of course, I made a prototype like that, and it just, it didn’t, just didn’t feel right, and I wasn’t fitted on the bike properly with the drop bar. So finally, and it, it’s somewhat funny, like I Strava testing on gravel is a lot more. The segments are longer. And some days you feel good, you know, on a 4050, mile ride, some days you don’t, and it takes a lot of time. So comparing times, it was difficult. When I finally i. Figured out the geometry I was living in Alabama, and my dealer southern carnage, and I forgot what it’s like a small town in Alabama, but he’s such a cool bike shop. He’s a bit of an OG down owner as well. He did group gravel rides once a week, and he would have, like, groups of 3020, people. And he’s, he’s turned into a fairly big gravel rider, and we’re the same height. So I dropped off this final prototype to him, and I told him, tell me what’s wrong with it. I was I told him, I don’t care which What does. What it does good, I need to know what it does bad. And because I couldn’t find anything anymore, I was like, I think this is it. And I almost wanted to make another prototype so that Thursday, so it’s Friday. I called him because I didn’t hear from him, and I was like, So what’s wrong with it? And he goes, Well, sorry, you’re not going to be able to get it back. And I’m like, Oh no. Something go wrong? And he said, No, I’m keeping it. You’re not getting this back. Let me know how much you want. And I started laughing. I was like, so it’s so, so you like it? And he was like, it is perfect. I this is, you got to make this. I’ve been working on them. I ended up having to make my own fork. So I made my own titanium fork, and in order to coincide with the geometry that was one of the missing pieces of why it was I just couldn’t find a fork, and I couldn’t design the frame around the fork to get just proper stack heights and stuff to make me fit right, and also get the hammer down when I’m pedaling or out of the saddle, and still be stable and easy to turn on like 2030, mile an hour descent. So anyway, yeah, probably in the next couple months I’m going to release it. I’m only making 30 of them, so very limited. I just kind of want it for myself again. And, yeah, if other people want it cool, maybe I’ll make more again, you know, in like a year or so. But it was just, it’s she was so much work, and I’d imagine other companies will probably make a mixed will gravel bike down the line. I don’t see why not. I mean, just even taking a single track off off of a gravel road, you just don’t feel like you’re gonna die, and you’re still able to have fun. And that’s what bikes are about. Jeff Barber 57:58Yeah, that’s a good upgrade, and to fit smaller riders, I would guess too, people are Yeah, in between like a, like a 650 B gravel bike and a regular full size 700 C, yeah, it makes sense. So yeah, in addition to mullet cycles, you run miles wide industries which offers some unique products. We kind of talked about cable buddies, the fork, cork, sticky fingers, brake lever covers, which one of those products, or any of your products, is your your personal favorite? Miles 58:33You know, that’s a really, really hard question. I probably, and this might come as a surprise, I’d probably say the Wet Seal stiction lubricant, Jeff Barber 58:52Okay, yeah. Miles 58:54And it’s, it’s not the same formula as my old company. This actually developed when I was living in Asheville. So back like in 2014 2015 is when I came out with this. And the suspension experts, which was a suspense bike suspension shop in Asheville, they ended up getting purchased by Fox, but they were really good. And the I kind of worked with the owner on that, on coming up with something that would be safe and work and not attract dust and residue that stuff the moment I put it on my fork or my shock, it just instantly makes it feel like butter, instantly. And then, as well as my dropper post, so instantly, just like, Bing, fly right up, if it was having trouble going up. I use that stuff a lot. Jeff Barber 59:53Yeah, I’ve used it for sure, like on a sticky dropper post, one that I like, I actually, you know, probably. Really needed to service it, but, yeah, just put it’s a good band aid. Miles 1:00:05It’s a good band aid. Then I’ll probably, I mean, it comes close with the sticky fingers, the grips, because I don’t ride with gloves. And obviously, when I’m every time I ride, I’m on my brakes, I’m using them so and either times when I take them off, or I have a customer’s bike that I built up, and you know, their option without them, and I’ll do a quick parking lot ride just to make sure everything’s styled and it feels wrong grabbing metal brake levers. It just they almost like, I don’t want to sound like a wimp, but they almost hurt after being so used to the grips. So, you know, I mean, and the four quarts, great too. I have, like, a little plug kit for tubeless plugs, and that has saved me and a bunch of my friends, you know, it’s one of those things, like, is anybody have a spare plug, you know? Like, and I’ve got, yeah, I’ve got 10 of them right here in my steer tube, like a plow, you know, and that’s that one has saved. You know, if you, if you talk to me when I’m like, 15 miles out from a trailhead, 20 miles sometimes, and I got a flat all day. I’m gonna say this is the best product I’ve come out with, for sure, because it’s there and you never forget it. It just sits inside your your head tube. So yeah, but I priced it, yeah, the Wet Seal, and that stuff is, is butter, and there’s been a number of companies that have tried to replicate it over the years, because that stuff’s been out for like, 10 years already. But yeah, my formula is the best. Jeff Barber 1:02:01So, yeah, cool. Well, we talked about the titanium honeymaker that you just rolled out, and then obviously you’re working on the gravel bike. But what else is there? Anything else that’s next for Mullet or Miles Wide you can tell us about? Miles 1:02:21So for Mullet, I’m kind of working on something, which I mean, I would love to share, but if I do, everyone’s gonna kind of jump on it, and I don’t want to, I want to release it and then say, Here surprise. So, yeah, can’t really, you know, the gravel bike is kind of like the next, the next thing you might see, like a teaser of what I’m doing. I mean, I really don’t post on social media. I could totally hire someone, obviously, but it’s just, I don’t I, I don’t think it’s healthy. I don’t know. I’m not. I guess I’m an older generation and I’m not. Yeah, I don’t get into it, but I’ll probably, I’ll probably shoot a shoot out a little teaser of what you could expect, as far as miles wide. I’ve got like a shock grease that which you can use on anything that I’ve been working on. I’ll probably release that in a couple months. It’s really good. And then I’ve got this thing, which I don’t know if the video is, is on or not, but this is like a little four cork attachment thing. And, yeah, I don’t know if this might not be PC to show, but yeah, it’s like, it’s a, it’s a little doohickey that you can I guess smoke oregano out of. And it attaches to the fork cork. And it’s got a little secret storage compartment in here, and then it goes back into, you know, screws onto the fork cork, hides in your steer too. I’ve got that, and I’ve also got a multi tool as well that attaches to the four cork that will probably won’t be ready for a couple more months, and that, you know well, and if you don’t, Jeff Barber 1:04:54if you don’t partake of the oregano, you could use that to put like a have one of those Air Tags, right? That’s a good spot to put an Air Tag so nobody steals your bike. Miles 1:05:04Yeah, people have, like, sent me photos of stuff, of what they stick up their exterior tube. It’s very impressive. I’ve seen like first aid kit to emergency energy bars, like, yeah, a bunch of cash, yeah, it’s, it’s, it’s a hole, you know, might as well fill it with something instead of just leaving it exposed to mud and water. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, and obviously an air cat, yeah, you can totally stick an air tag up there. Jeff Barber 1:05:48Well, miles, it’s been great talking with you today and hearing the backstory behind mullet cycles and miles wide industries, I know our listeners are going to enjoy getting a deeper understanding of Wake what, 321, of what makes your bikes and accessories unique, and we’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for that gravel bike and whatever else you’ve got in the works. So thanks for sharing with us. Miles 1:06:10Hey, thanks so much for having me. So I hope it wasn’t too long, and I hope it was interesting for people. Jeff Barber 1:06:18Oh, it was great.

As it opens its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, fintech giant Revolut has pledged to invest £3 billion in the UK, creating 1000 new high-skilled jobs over the next five years. 3 23 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Revolut's pledge comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, says: "Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change."Earlier this year, the Financial Times reported that Reeves had clashed with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey over efforts to accelerate Revolut's authorisation as a fully-licenced bank, with Reeves eager to see the fintech get the greenlight as soon as possible.Revolut's UK commitment is part of a wider five-year global plan to invest £10 billion and create 10,000 jobs as it targets 100 million customers by mid 2027 and entry into 30 new markets by 2030.The firm is expecting to launch as a bank in Mexico next year, with entry into Colombia and Argentina also planned. Having secured a payments license in April, it is preparing to launch in India, while a push into Africa is underway, beginning with South Africa.Nik Storonsky, CEO, Revolut, says: “Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. "From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers."

Big Mike’s, the well-known restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, is closing, with its owner citing “insurmountable challenges” in the industry. In a post on Instagram, chef and proprietor Gareth Smith said Sunday was the restaurant’s last service. “This is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write. It feels like failure, but it isn’t. We’re proud of what we achieved, we shot for the stars, poured everything into it – heart, soul, sweat, tears, life savings, even the house deposit – but the brutal truth is the maths just don’t math any more,” he wrote. He said he was proud of his team and grateful to his guests and suppliers. “My final act as gaffer is to go to bat for my staff so they land safely in new homes,” he added.

Title: House Oversight probes whether American retirees' pension funds are being weaponized: 'Progressive playbook'
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-oversight-probes-whether-american-retirees-pension-funds-weaponized-progressive-playbook

‘Fox News Sunday’ anchor Shannon Bream previews her show on the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s home and potential charges over alleged confidential emails on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is setting its sights on insurance companies that may have discriminated against entities with right-wing views. The committee is also looking into whether retirees' pension accounts were being used to invest in progressive policies they may not necessarily agree with, Fox News Digital has learned. "The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper restrictions on access to capital and capital markets of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries (such as cryptocurrency, energy, and firearms)," Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). "The Committee has engaged with whistleblowers who had their insurance policies cancelled for widely-held political positions or for operating legal businesses considered out of favor by progressive activists." HOUSE PASSES TRUMP-BACKED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer is expanding his probe into financial discrimination against right-wing entities and people. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The move is an expansion of the House Oversight Committee's ongoing investigation into whether public financial institutions engaged in debanking against people and entities with right-wing views. Comer is also probing whether companies implementing progressive policies are doing so at the expense of millions of retired Americans' personal investments. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his capacity as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that his panel "is investigating the prolific use of proxy proposals and other activism targeting corporate boards of directors by activists pursuing political agendas at the expense of the retirement and personal savings of Americans." BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO THAT WOULD 'IMPLICATE' TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS "Specifically, the Committee seeks to understand how giant investment managers and pension fund managers, aided by proxy advisory firms, sidestepped or abandoned their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries to pursue a political agenda and whether new legislation is needed to protect investors," Comer stated. "At a minimum, Americans deserve to fully know if their hard-earned savings are being used in a progressive playbook." The letter accused certain large asset management firms like BlackRock of putting clients' money into green energy initiatives, for example, rather than more profitable areas, in order to promote a left-wing agenda. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is pictured during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on June 11, 2025. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg/Getty Images) BlackRock pushed back on such accusations in a public statement on its website, however. "One of the most critical tasks of an asset manager is to provide clients with insights on short- and long-term trends in the global economy that can impact their portfolios. We do this across all sectors – from healthcare to technology to energy," the company wrote. "Climate risk is one such trend given its implications for the economy. We believe that companies that better manage their exposure to climate risk and capitalize on opportunities will generate better long term financial outcomes." BlackRock's website also asserted that the "choice of where to invest ultimately rests with our clients." "We are bound to adhere to their investment guidelines and objectives. We do not dictate particular investment strategies," it said. And on a broader scale, the committee looking into whether publicly-traded companies are running afoul of President Donald Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices by simply listing it under another name. "[T]he Committee remains concerned following reports of publicly traded companies intentionally camouflaging or rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies to hide such discrimination from "the Trump Administration, courts or influential activists,'" Comer wrote to several organizations opposing corporate discrimination, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. "At minimum, shareholders and retirement plan beneficiaries deserve transparency around discriminatory practices employed by corporate directors and officers as such behavior is rebranded. Replacing DEI and ESG titles with 'employee engagement' or ‘inclusion and impact’ represents yet another deceptive practice."

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump's order, signed in January 2025, barred financial institutions, major corporations, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies and specific industries like medicine and commercial airlines from promoting or implementing DEI standards. Comer accused the previous White House of promoting discriminatory practices, however, in a statement to Fox News Digital. "The Oversight Committee is investigating discriminatory practices in the American financial system and the Biden Administration’s role in supporting them," he wrote. "Whether it is using the boardroom to achieve what the political left could not accomplish at the ballot box, or canceling Americans’ insurance policies and debanking them for their political views, these actions are wrong and deprive Americans of their constitutional rights."

Title: BlackRock’s crypto ETFs generate $260 million annual revenue

BlackRock’s cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have emerged as a highly profitable venture, generating $260 million in annualized revenue, according to recent data shared by Leon Waidmann, head of research at the nonprofit Onchain Foundation. The revenue includes $218 million from Bitcoin ETFs and $42 million from Ether-based products. The performance underscores the growing role of regulated crypto investment products in institutional finance. BlackRock’s success is being closely watched by other traditional asset managers as a potential benchmark for launching similar offerings in the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Analysts highlight the significance of BlackRock’s ETFs in positioning cryptocurrencies as a serious asset class within traditional finance. Waidmann likened the ETFs’ trajectory to Amazon’s early business model, noting that the funds provide a practical entry point into the crypto ecosystem for institutional investors and retirement accounts. “This isn’t experimentation anymore,” Waidmann said. “The world’s largest asset manager has proven that crypto is a serious profit center. That’s a quarter-billion-dollar business, built almost overnight. For comparison, many fintech unicorns don’t make that in a decade.” The performance of these ETFs may encourage more institutional players to enter the crypto market, extending the current market cycle beyond the typical four-year Bitcoin halving-driven patterns. Analysts suggest that inflows from corporate treasuries and ETF products could continue to drive demand for both Bitcoin and Ether. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is approaching a significant milestone, with total assets under management (AUM) nearing $85 billion. This accounts for approximately 57.5% of the total US spot Bitcoin ETF market, according to blockchain data from Dune. By comparison, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF holds $22.8 billion, representing 15.4% of market share, making it the second-largest US spot Bitcoin ETF. The rapid growth of BlackRock’s fund is noteworthy given its short history, debuting on January 11, 2024. In less than two years, it has climbed from being the 31st largest fund across both crypto and traditional ETFs to the 22nd largest, according to VettaFi. Market analysts are optimistic that continued ETF inflows could support a renewed rally in Bitcoin prices. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget exchange, suggested that the institutional appetite for crypto ETFs helps establish a bullish floor for risk assets, reinforcing a “buy the dip” strategy amid ongoing macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Additionally, there is speculation that the inclusion of cryptocurrency in US 401(k) retirement plans could further bolster demand for Bitcoin, with some projections estimating potential price targets as high as $200,000 by year-end, according to André Dragosch, head of European research at crypto asset manager Bitwise. BlackRock’s crypto ETFs illustrate the increasing intersection of traditional finance with the digital asset market. The funds’ performance demonstrates not only the profitability of regulated crypto products but also their capacity to attract institutional capital and provide a structured entry point for investors navigating the evolving crypto landscape.

Title: Maria Steen profile: Campaign for Áras attempts to paint her as challenger of status quo

Full Content:
Broadcaster Brendan O’Connor was in the plush Park Hotel in Kenmare for a family break, when he noticed a married couple with a “pristine” Mad Men kind of glamour who were also enjoying a weekend away. The RTÉ veteran would later recount how he struck up a conversation with the wife. She turned to him, “like something from a Tennessee Williams play”, and said: “I believe I have you at a disadvantage. I’m Maria Steen. I really hope there’s no hard feelings.” It was 2014, and O’Connor had earlier that year been plunged into a national controversy known as “Pantigate”. His Saturday night talkshow was forced into a €85,000 defamation payout after Ireland’s pre-eminent drag queen Panti Bliss had suggested on the prime time show that members of the Iona Institute and other conservative columnists were homophobic. The public broadcaster would be castigated after it emerged it had made the payout to John Waters, David Quinn, Dr Patricia Casey, Dr John Murray and Steen. Throughout the 2010s, the Iona Institute had become synonymous with a conservative resistance to social change. The Catholic think-tank was already bracing for the anticipated referendum on marriage equality the following year. By this point, Steen had emerged as one of its strongest campaigners with her staunch arguments against the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act. Before 2012, the Iona Institute had largely avoided abortion debates because it felt the pro-life campaign space was saturated. But when the Fine Gael-led coalition moved to legislate for the X case in the wake of the death of Savita Halappanavar, the Iona Institute was galvanised and put Ms Steen forward as a spokeswoman against the proposed law. [ Independent Ireland votes to back Maria Steen’s candidacy for presidentOpens in new window ] Over 10 years later, Steen’s conservative comrades in the Iona Institute would only learn from The Irish Times that the stay-at-home mother was considering running for president. During Pantigate, Steen and her colleagues were seen by some as the last vestiges of the old Irish establishment. Now Steen is being presented by her backers as the only true anti-establishment voice in the presidential field, given her almost outré views on social issues. Ten years on from the marriage equality referendum, Steen’s campaign seeks to frame her as a trailblazing challenger to the new orthodoxy of progressive Ireland. Steen was raised in Ballsbridge and is the daughter of the well-known architect Seán Davin. Her aunts include former presidential candidate Joan Freeman and Theresa Lowe, the barrister and former RTÉ presenter. Her mother Margaret Davin taught her to read, write and tell the time before she started school, which Steen would cite as the foundation of her desire to homeschool her own children. She is married to senior counsel Neil Steen and they have five children together. They have enjoyed a comfortable south Dublin family life, with the 2016 renovation of their exclusive multimillion euro Blackrock home meriting an article in the property section of The Irish Times. Steen first qualified as an architect and then later as a barrister. As a mother she would qualify as a Montessori teacher and choose to work within the home. This would form the basis of her strong performance against the 2024 family and care referendums, particularly her advocacy of stay-at-home mothers. She is profoundly orthodox Catholic, and has opposed divorce and complained about “the death of procreative sex”. In 2018, the telegenic Steen became the No side’s most valuable weapon in their campaign to keep the Eighth Amendment. She dominated in an infamous television debate on Claire Byrne Live. The event was decried by the Yes side who claimed audience members had been jeering and sniggering. Steen did so well that the anti-abortion campaign tried to swap her out for fellow campaigner Cora Sherlock on a Prime Time debate the following week, resulting in a huge behind-the-scenes row with RTÉ. In the end, the show went to air with just one politician from each side: Simon Harris for Yes and Peadar Tóibín for No, which forced Miriam O’Callaghan to apologise to viewers for an abortion debate led by two men. Within Leinster House, many independents who don’t agree with Steen’s arch-conservative views are backing her on a freedom of expression basis. There is also a fear emerging among conservatives that in a three horse race, Catherine Connolly would “hand the presidency to the Government”. While there is a collegiate respect from many independents towards the liberal Connolly, many feel that Steen would present a greater challenge to the status quo.

Title: Crypto ETNs: what you need to know
URL: https://monevator.com/crypto-etns/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:11:08Z
Full Content:
Exciting news: after three years of prohibition, UK retail investors will again be able to buy exchange-traded notes (ETNs) linked to cryptocurrencies. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifts its ban on 8 October. Compliant products will likely hit mainstream brokers shortly thereafter. According to the FCA, 12% of UK adults own crypto assets (around seven million people) and 26% of non-crypto asset owners say, “they would be more likely to buy crypto assets if the market and activities were regulated.” In other words, crypto is gaining acceptance as a part of many people’s investment portfolios. (At least until the next crypto winter.) What we want to know is: That will do for starters. Exchange-traded products of all types (ETFs, ETNs, and ETCs) enable more everyday people to invest in an asset class without getting embroiled in all the hassle that direct ownership usually brings with it. You get the idea. With exchange-traded products, you can outsource the grief of asset ownership to trusted providers for a reasonable fee. However that doesn’t mean all exchange-traded products are the same. If you buy an MSCI World ETF then you can be pretty sure you are getting well regulated exposure to over a thousand leading stock market-listed companies. But ETNs are not ETFs. And crypto ownership entails different risks to share ownership. Importantly, you don’t actually own any crypto when you invest in this type of product. But the ETN issuer may well do. That exposes it and you to a steaming jungle of risks that I’ll touch upon below. Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open. The FCA has only green-lit the sale of crypto ETNs (not ETFs) to retail investors in the UK.1 The UK-approved crypto ETN headlines are: ETNs aren’t new. They’ve been used to track certain assets (like old-school currencies) long before crypto. Indeed crypto ETNs aren’t new either. They were offered to the UK public up until they were restricted in January 2021. And they’ve gathered billions in assets from UK professional investors and European retail investors since then. These existing products are obviously the ones most likely to come on-stream for retail investors after 8 October. Which is handy for us, because it means we can size them up beforehand. Crypto ETNs are issued by both traditional investment asset managers and crypto-native outfits. Familiar names that already offer ETNs in the UK and Europe include WisdomTree, Invesco, Fidelity, VanEck, and BlackRock. Crypto-focussed brands include 21Shares, Bitwise, Coinbase, and Valour. ETNs are debt securities rather than investment funds. In exchange for your cash, you get a promise that the issuer will pay you a return in the future. What happens if the ETN’s issuer defaults? In that case you may be paid less than you are owed – or not at all. In debt parlance, you’ll ‘take a haircut’. Probably one that feels more like the medieval lock-chopping practised by religious maniacs than a nice tint and blow-dry down your local salon. But what might prevent you from getting entirely mullet-ed in such a scenario is collateral. A ‘collateralised’ ETN protects the value of your investment with a big stash of assets lodged with an (ideally) independent and reputable custodian. Should your issuer be unable to pay, this collateral can be sold to honour the debt. You might ask does your issuer stow away enough collateral to cover the value of its obligations? Is the collateral good quality? Will it fetch enough on the market to pay back investors during a crisis? All good questions, which you’ll have to answer on a case-by-case basis (and by delving into the details provided by your ETN on its website). ETNs can be dated or undated debt instruments. You’d expect crypto ETNs to be undated – that is, for the security to be available so long as there’s a market for it and nothing blows up. But an ETN can be called. This means the issuer can redeem it at any time – paying back investors with the cash in the collateral kitty. It’s worth reading the ETN’s prospectus to understand what happens in the event your chosen product is redeemed early. Especially the sections on how the claims of other parties will be paid before the investors. You’ll likely come across choice phrases such as: …following satisfaction of all priority claims, such Security holders [that’s us!] may not receive payment of the Early Redemption Amount in full and may receive substantially less and may potentially receive nothing. There’s lovely. There’ll also be an early redemption fee to boot. So choose an ETN that’s stocked with plenty of collateral. The issuer is under no obligation to make any other assets available in the event of a shortfall. ETNs can be synthetic as opposed to physically backed. A synthetic ETN employs a swap-based derivative to deliver the performance of the underlying asset. This introduces another layer of counterparty risk, because the company providing the swap could fail. This may be moot for now, since it looks like only physically-backed crypto ETNs will be admitted to the London Stock Exchange. But it’s still worth checking if you’re compiling a shortlist of candidates. Here’s a quick USD comparison of the Bitwise Physical Bitcoin ETP (BTCE) versus Bitcoin’s market price. Source: Google Finance (26 Sep 2020 to 22 September 2025). Source: justETF (26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025). JustETF and Google Finance can’t quite agree on what five years is, so up next is the result I got when I matched the dates for a comparable long-term view: Dates: 26 Sep 2020 to 19 September 2025. (BTCE inception date: 9 Jun 2020, TER: 2%.) That’s an astounding return from Bitcoin either way – assuming you held on during the 77% death slide from November 2021 through November 2022. But still, BTCE gave up 5% a year in comparison to Bitcoin – a tracking difference that isn’t entirely accounted for by the ETN’s eye-watering 2% TER. Transaction costs, taxation, blockchain network fees, collateral overheads, brokerage charges, and various other operational frictions can all eat into your return without necessarily being captured by the TER. You’re also likely to see a clause like this nestled in a crypto ETN’s prospectus: The market value and price of the ETP securities does not exclusively depend on the prevailing price of bitcoin and changes in the prevailing price of bitcoin may not necessarily result in a comparable change in the market value of the ETP securities. Other ETNs may track their linked cryptocurrency more faithfully than BTCE. I haven’t checked other products or timeframes. But the point here is I’ve never seen such a large tracking difference gap when investigating vanilla ETFs tethered to mainstream asset classes. On that basis, I recommend checking the tracking difference performance of all your prospective ETN candidates versus their linked cryptocurrencies. It looks like being an important factor. Watch out for wide spreads, too. This is another cost of business that may vary widely, depending on the ETN’s liquidity and, at times, shifting perceptions of the creditworthiness of the issuer and any associated service providers. Reading the risk section of a crypto ETN’s prospectus is like visiting a chamber of horrors. Every grisly fate and sticky end your ETN could meet is listed. Or at least I hope it’s listed. Either way it’s an educational read and, if you’re on the fence about crypto investing, it could send you running in the opposite direction of the alluring 900% return graph I showed above. To give you a flavour, let’s pick out a few highlights from the risk section of the iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) prospectus. (To be clear this is just illustrative: I have no reason to believe that IB1T is a particularly risky crypto ETN.) What follows is a sample of the higher-dimensional risk space you enter when crypto is involved. It’s got more dimensions than string theory… …the Issuer’s bitcoin may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which may result in the value of the Securities being reduced, potentially to zero. A breach of the Issuer’s account at the Custodian or the Prime Execution Agent could result in the partial or total loss of the Issuer’s assets, which is likely to result in a partial or full loss in the value of the Securities. If any relevant Cryptoassets are lost, stolen, damaged or otherwise compromised in circumstances in which the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent, another service provider to the Issuer or any other party is liable to the Issuer for such loss, theft, damage or compromise, the Custodian, the Prime Execution Agent or other responsible party may not have sufficient resources to fully compensate the Issuer. The security procedures in place for the Issuer’s bitcoin may include offline ‘cold’ storage, the use of multiple encrypted private key ‘shards’, and other measures designed to reduce the risk of the loss or theft of the Issuer’s bitcoin. However, these cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or force majeure event that may be experienced by the Issuer or the Custodian… Crypto asset platforms are often unregulated in nature and may be vulnerable to manipulative trading activity, business failure, fraud and security breaches. In addition, if a crypto asset platform which a Series of Securities utilises for storage, trading and/or settlement becomes insolvent this may lead to a loss of the Issuer’s underlying assets and therefore a loss for the relevant Security holders. Crypto assets may be subject to attacks by malicious actors or groups of actors. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power dedicated to mining on the Bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the Bitcoin blockchain on which transactions in bitcoin rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner or at all (a ‘51% attack’). To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Bitcoin network, or the Bitcoin community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Bitcoin blockchain may not be possible. There have been a number of examples of 51% attacks on cryptocurrencies. …there is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding Bitcoin, which is estimated to be reached by approximately the year 2140, will not be changed. If a hard fork changing the 21 million supply cap is widely adopted, the limit on the supply of Bitcoin could be lifted, which could have an adverse impact on the value of bitcoin and the value of the Securities. The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. Some developers may also be funded by entities whose interests are at odds with the interests of other participants in the Bitcoin network or with the interests of investors in bitcoin. A bad actor could also seek to interfere with the operation of the Bitcoin network by attempting to exercise a malign influence over a core developer. There is currently no tax certainty regarding the treatment of investments in crypto assets across various jurisdictions due to the novelty of the asset class. Accordingly, the taxation of the crypto assets and associated investments can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be subject to change, potentially also with retroactive effect. Any change in the tax treatment of the crypto assets could result in the Issuer incurring additional taxes… …and there’s plenty more where that came from. I’m not even getting into the regulatory risk, or the uncertainty over whether the issuer could legally enforce its claim to the ETN’s crypto collateral held with third-parties. Really, you could replace all 23,867 words in the prospectus’ risk section with the legend: AAAAARGH! Or as the issuer succinctly puts it: Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. Okay, let’s turn now to something more relaxing. Tax. A crypto ETN does not pay an income. Thus the only tax to worry about is capital gains – payable if you hold the product outside of your tax shelters. Also, if the ETN is domiciled outside of the UK then check it has reporting fund status. If not then capital gains will be taxed at income tax rates when you sell. That could hurt! Note that this reporting fund stuff doesn’t apply if you’ve safely stashed your ETN in an ISA or SIPP. When comparing crypto ETNs, look for: Cost of ownership – What’s the TER, bid-offer spreads, tracking difference? Collateral – What assets are held as collateral, how much is held versus the value of the product, are there daily disclosures, is the collateral insured and independently audited? The custodian – Is the keeper of the collateral independent and reputable? Securities lending policy – Can the collateral be lent out? That would invite yet more counterparty risk. Asset protection – Is the crypto mostly held offline in cold storage? Are the ETN’s assets segregated from other parties? Product structure – Is the ETN backed by physical cryptocurrency or another asset, or does it use synthetic replication (that is, swap-based derivatives)? Physical is usually safer. Price index – Google it. Is this index reputable? Does it definitely track the crypto’s spot price? ETN leverage – Look for a 1:1 ratio to ensure you’re getting a non-leveraged product. (Unless you actually want leverage, you complete and utter nutter.) Tax – Can I hold the product in my ISA or SIPP? If not, does it have reporting fund status? Early redemption, default, and failure – What does the prospectus say about these scenarios? Obviously none of this is investing advice. We’re just running through things to think about should you decide you want to research these new offerings for yourself. Personally, I can’t say I’m about to sink my life savings into crypto. But I will follow along with interest. I think crypto is an astounding phenomenon but I have grave doubts about its worth as an asset class in a wider portfolio. Of course, my views are neither here nor there. And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. Not to mention the various other crypto-powered vehicles that had crept onto the market. Is this progress? I don’t know. But I am fascinated. Take it steady, The Accumulator Thanks for reading!

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Thanks very much for the detailed breakdown TA, I will stay away from crypto myself for many reasons but good luck to those who jump on board . TFJ @TA – thanks for this. Might be worth 1 or 2% of my SIPP, carved out of the gold allocation… Maybe. Blimey. I thought crypto was bad enough as it is before you stir in all this obfuscation into the pot. You can buy crypto on the open market. You can store it in a cold wallet, which you can back up the bejesus out of it. I hold gold via ETCs. The downsides to holding physical gold are obvious. And they just don’t apply to crypto. Buy your crypto and transfer to a cold wallet. Back up enough times as gives you peace of mind, sort of like the first pics of your newborn. Some in cloud, some printed. Now you have a bearer store of value – the greatest value of crypto is that you can run with it. I find no temptation to hold crypto with an ETN – it’s all added counterparty risk. I have to admit I don’t hold mine in a cold wallet yet, but that is because I am building up a position and it’s only £3k now, so I am good with coinbase and accept the risk. > And even the FCA has caved to the inevitable, because swathes of Brits were opting to take their chances in unregulated offshore exchanges. I’m not sure this is any sort of an improvement. It’s like a flawed sword that fails you in your hour of need. Buy it on the open market and you know you are in a nest of vipers, spivs and dodgy geezers, and it’s up to you to take life-changing amounts offline and keep them offline. What exactly is the FCA protecting you from that you couldn’t do yourself, we know here be dragons, adding a load more indirection and ways to crap out that they won’t protect you from strikes me as bonkers. There’s a delightful honesty to > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. and the FCA hasn’t helped you with that one iota by adding even more ways to screw up and more counterparties to make off with the loot. Buying bitcoin needn’t be so damn complicated. It is inherently dodgy, because of all the risks to the underlying system which is not 100% understood, for all I know the ghost of Satoshi’s wallet may one day hold the entire edifice to ransom, and advances in computing could blow the whole thing up. Adding even more dodginess to the existing dodginess and calling is FCA approved dodginess + is bonkers. For the love of God, why? So maybe the small Alternatives section of the portfolio will now be: – SGLN – CMFP – IBIT or BTIP? Who knew!? We once held consoles so don’t be so mean. Think we sold at £30…..great investment we inherited there. Excellent piece. Thank you @TA. It had to happen. Usually, a thematic ETF launch is a sign of a big top, and an attempt to create exit liquidity for early investors. But here, with crypto, it’s our flat footed FCA who are to finger for the timing. At the time of the FCA ban on 6 October 2020 the price of Bitcoin was about £8,200. Today it is ~£84,000. Half a hand clap there for protecting consumers! What really caught my eye though is how this regulatory shift opens doors to hybrids like the 21Shares Bitcoin and Gold ETP (ticker BOLD, currently Zurich listed). While you rightly compare pure crypto ETNs to a wild ride, echoing your “AAAAARGH!” on the prospectus risks, BOLD feels like a more tempered option for diversification hungry passives like me. It’s physically backed, blending Bitcoin’s growth potential with gold’s potential inflation hedging stability via monthly inverse volatility rebalancing (around 60/40 split lately). It’s a nod to Ray Dalio’s all-weather portfolio ethos, where gold acts as a ballast against Bitcoin’s volatility swings. It’s not FSCS protected, and those operational risks and frictions (Blockchain fees, custody issues) all apply in spades, but the 0.65% TER is ‘competitive”in this space, and its performance since 2022 (over 130% cumulative) shows some resilience in choppy markets. For fellow passives, BOLD could possibly be a part of that 5-10% satellite allocation to less / negatively / uncorrelated assets; enhancing diversification without upending a core equity index tracking approach. I’m not all in with it, or crypto more generally, though, and your skepticism here resonates. But in a world of persistent inflation, deficits and fiat doubts, maybe it’s worth a look. I do have to say though that, IMO, there’s a massively underated (and under thought through) growing risk in relation to Blockchains like Bitcoin’s from quantum computing advances. I’ve commented on this before on Monevator, but here’s a recent YouTube piece covering this ground: https://youtu.be/HKcVpZIsP6k?feature=shared The TL:DR (with timestamps) is that quantum computers could deduce private keys from public keys, allowing attackers to steal funds from existing wallets [36:57]. Older, dormant wallets, including the legendary stash of Satoshi, are particularly vulnerable because their public keys are already exposed on the Blockchain [37:06]. Upgrading a decentralized network like Bitcoin requires global consensus, which is a slow and challenging process given the networks decentralisation and diversity [58:22] necessitating a “hard fork,” that could divide the community and prevent a timely enough decision [01:23:57]. Millions of existing wallets, especially older ones whose public keys are already exposed, cannot be retroactively updated, remaining permanently vulnerable [00:39:50] Transitioning the entire digital infrastructure of BTC is akin to replacing the nervous system of civilization mid-flight [01:25:03]. Despite repeated warnings, the crypto ecosystem still lacks any sense of urgency, viewing the threat as distant or inconvenient. Yet the consensus from experts (Gartner analysts estimate a 50% chance of disruption by 2037 [49:59]) and major financial institutions like BlackRock (who are massively involved in crypto ETPs) is that the quantum computing threat to Blockchain is real, and increasingly near term [01:09:06]. Thanks for the thorough breakdown; it’s armed me to tread (exceeding) carefully after 8th October! Here be dragons … and their treasure (maybe). @DeltaHedge #6 > BOLD – 50:50 gold:BTC, 0.65% OCF Oy vey, truly we are in the End Times. For starters, why 50:50? Secondly go git yourself the gold ETC from any of the ones listed here at 0.12% and match with your preferred ration of BTC bought straight off, and save yourself 0.55% fees. Job done. I share the BTC computing advance worry. As the man said > Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. IMO you only need some BTC to leaven the mix, 50:50 is way too much BTC IMO. But I suppose if you are a GenZ moonshotter, well, the sky’s the limit @ermine #8: yep, it ain’t cheap, but you can’t really fairly compare it to a plain vanilla gold or even to a Bitcoin ETP. Allocation is fully dynamic on this one – rebalances monthly using an inverse volatility weighting mechanism to equal risk exposure (i.e., higher volatility assets like Bitcoin get a lower weight, but this adapts as the relative share of volatility between gold and Bitcoin changes). As of 22nd September, allocation was approx 62% Bitcoin and 38% gold (this fluctuates; earlier reports, from when Bitcoin was relatively more volatile, sometimes reference 25% Bitcoin / 75% gold split, but it’s not fixed). Your nearest fee comparator is perhaps an active fund (get out the garlic and the silver crosses on that one!) or something quanty. Fascinating (worrying?) how something ostensibly so easy in which to dabble can have such complex issues. I think my attraction to diversification is overtaken by simply not understanding this well enough, even with this excellent piece, thanks @TA. Maybe no current need for impenetrably complex asset classes for a GenZ moonshot – even in its pre-retirement de-risked state, portfolio is zooming! A bit frothy perhaps, but at least a risk I can get my head round. As I mentioned on a previous post – this is the FCA doing what they do – ineptly making sure retail don’t have the opportunity to make money. Crypto bad at $12000 per BTC. We protect you from this volatile instrument Crypto fine at $120000 per BTC. Fill your boots. I’ve held the Ethereum ETN since 2017 in my sipp. The last ban coincided with the very start of the pandemic bull run. I had wanted to buy the BTC one. But no. HL even slapped it with an immediate ban on purchase in Oct 2020 prior to the fca actually stopping it. “The FCA have said it’s unsafe”. You what?! I screamed at them down the phone for doing so but was too lazy to move my sipp. They did the same with Rhodium under the guise of not having a KID for the deutschebank etf, coincidentally just before the 2018 bull run. Fortunately I’d bought some prior. Jokers. It bears saying again. They are perfectly fine with people buying stocks that can go to zero. I’ve bought plenty over the years. No protection – and neither did I want any. Let us make our own choices. Excellent – thank you. Crypto not really my thing, but as you say interesting to follow, and anyway this is not really about Crypto, but about ETNs – makes sense but had no idea the tracking was so bad! Hadn’t seen this elsewhere so really great to have all this info laid out. Thanks for the article. I enjoy reading about crypto and at the same time I have no desire to touch it with my own money, The FT has an interesting article about companies pivoting to holding crypto and buying back their own shares https://www.ft.com/content/573be235-56a6-4556-90af-a8eac887dbf9 It’ll all end in tears, it’s just the next dodgy financial product waiting to reel in unsuspecting investors before it goes bust. > The cryptography underlying bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. > Any resulting reduction in the integrity of, or confidence in, the source code or cryptography underlying crypto assets generally could negatively affect the demand for crypto assets and therefore may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and consequently the value of the Securities. I agree with Delta Hedge with regards to the vulnerability of Bitcoin to quantum computing attacks, and appreciate The Accumulator bringing it up in the article. Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. Right now, bitcoin is like a company with ~30% free floating shares. When quantum computing attacks release assets from all the wallets whose owners have lost the keys, the float will go up, depressing prices. When some of the actively held wallets get drained, there will be less demand for buying leaky buckets and it will be a fun show to watch. On the other hand, quantum bitcoin miners could reduce the energy footprint Etherium has previously had a hard fork to reverse a hack – they might have more direction with the creator (Vitalik Butlerin) still involved in attempting to transition to Post-Quantum Cryptograpthy, but I don’t envy their chances @ermine (or anyone else who has experience of buying bitcoin!). Could I perhaps ask you a question as you seem to have a handle on bitcoin. I purchased a small chunk many years ago. It has been on my to do list to look at buying more as a diversifier. I hold with blockchain. When I look to purchase via blockchain a £100 purchase has fees (and perhaps a spread) of £2.99 (2.9%). A purchase of £1200 would have fees of £41.88 (£3.39%). Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 and £1200 @ £46.00. Is this typical of the level of fees I would have to incur to buy bitcoin direct? Or am I missing something…. This is great @TA – the list of risks is an actually a good route in to better understanding of crypto generally. EG 51% attack! @ermine your comments make sense to me too. And thanks to @delta hedge for excellent further elaboration. Thanks again for covering this topic @Pikolo — Hi! You write: Also smart for iShares to enumerate it, though wording it as “could become ineffective” rather than “will soon become ineffective” strikes me as undeservedly optimistic. I suppose this is because iShares have lawyers drafting legal documents, rather than the rather lower bar of us anonymous commenters on the Internet… 😉 From what I’ve read the consensus of quantum computing really threatening cryptography ranges from 15 years away to ‘never’ which would seem to give plenty of time for Bitcoin to transition to a post-quantum cryptography world *if* required. There should be plenty of signposts along the way, too, given the apparent challenges of scaling quantum computers. Moore’s Law doesn’t seem to apply, at least pending some kind of novel breakthrough. Of course ‘will’ might still arguably apply in my more optimistic scenario, but then there’s a lot of ‘wills’ that we don’t write into legal documents. My house will eventually crumble, and the Earth will be consumed by the sun. Not for me to worry about though. 😉 Also, we have to understand that a quantum computing world with genuinely useful compute-at-scale would be upending cryptography (and much else besides) all over the place, IMHO. It wouldn’t be a niche sideshow for crypto blogs and social media timelines like today. TLDR: I think Bitcoin has time to adapt, and I don’t see why 51% of those who control the network wouldn’t move to do so if required. @Ian #16 I took a look at my last Coinbase (advanced platform) transaction for BTC in GBP, placed at 9/19/25 21:59, filled at 06:59 the next day 0.00133763 BTC for £84,798.17 subtotal £113.43 fee 0.40 (I am post only, I do not allow taker) total £114.83 > Similar quotes on my coinbase app (which I have not purchased through yet) are £100 @ £3.89 I am an old git and I don’t use apps, and very definitely not for finance, I use the web interface. But this looks very high for coinbase. Have you switched to CB pro on the app – Coinbase regular does have high fees, I didn’t realise they are that high Now this is Bitcoin, so there are many areas where spivs can take you for a ride. Coinbase may be offering a poorer rate than other exchanges at any instant in time and finessing fees there. It’s hard to determine, given the shocking volatility. Cryptoradar shows the best exchange for any asset. I do not want a relationship with more than one exchange, the more people have your details the more chance of spivs hacking them. If/when I have a worrying amount on an excahnge I will bump the BTC into a cold wallet. IMO crypto is definitely something that should be held at the very end of your bargepole, and I only do BTC and ETH, mainly BTC. And I am mustelid, not whale, in the size of the holding, because in gold I trust. I have direct wallet experience in another cryptoasset, and the feeling I get there is that fees are higher for small transactions I did find the BOLD concept interesting, that’s BTC and gold. I can’t find the reference now, but basically BTC is a risk-on asset and gold isrisk-off fear, all other things being equal, which they aren’t at the moment. A small amount of BTC (~5-10% max) as a proportion of a gold + BTC has some merit, particularly if you rebalance it every so often – monthly seemed the target. I am not sure I CBA with that, but I have a paltry BTC holding, probably much less than yours as I am Johnny-come-lately, I was in then out, and more recently in with the BOLD idea. I am not the typical Monevator reader though, because I have reached where I want to be and have flicked the engines to cruise. Nobody who is trying to make their fortune should hold large amounts of non-productive stores of value. I hold about half in equities which is probably low round here. I absolutely respect TI/TAs right to kick this comment very far into touch as it’s dangerously active in a pretty dangerous asset class. Perhaps this was in the post and I overlooked it, but can anyone tell me why an ETN – which seems a rather complicated financial instrument – allowed but a straightforward ETF equivalent to SGLN is not? EDIT: I’ve just spotted that SGLN is an ETC not an ETF, so perhaps that’s also complicated and I just didn’t know! Not my area of expertise by any means (!), but is there any risk that Crypto ETNs, being debt securities, are treated by HMRC as deeply discounted securities for UK tax purposes, such that the entirety of any net return is taxed as income (and not as capital gains) outside a tax free wrapper? Probably nonsense but grateful for any thoughts. @Steve Lemon #20 I’ve held SGLN in the past and HL tells you that you can hold it in an ISA, SIPP or LISA. As you say it is an ETC, but a refreshing simplicity compared to this ETN. @TI #18: That’s a thoughtful and well-articulated argument for optimism, but…. ​ What about harvest now, decrypt later? Even if the breakthrough is 15 years away, encrypted data (including Bitcoin public keys from older wallets) can be collected today and stored. Once a powerful quantum computer is operational, those keys can be cracked retroactively, immediately emptying millions of coins, including Satoshi’s. This vulnerability can’t be patched. ​The assumption that the Bitcoin community will quickly agree to a hard fork for survival may be optimistic given past difficulties. The transition to a post-quantum algorithm would require a complex, consensus driven network (10,000+ nodes) upgrade. The debate to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit), which involved a much less radical change than a fundamental crypto-system swap (and was part of a compromise solution to double the effective block size from 1MB to ~2MB), took over three years of intense, acrimonious public debate before it achieved its lock in signal in mid-2017. There’s no small well coordinated aligned group with 51% of the hashing power who can push this through. This is maybe more akin to the situation with CDOs and RMBS in the run up to the GFC, where the banks failed to act in their own (and their own shareholders’ and senior employees’) self interests, despite a fair few voices pointing out well in advance (although admittedly, and ironically, a bit too early as it turns out) that the whole house of cards would topple. ​ While the consensus on quantum computing timelines is indeed wide, the defense must be 100% successful and proactive. The attacker only needs one successful, secret breakthrough to compromise the system before the slow, global consensus process completes. This is an existential threat, not merely one of many. The current security of a multi trillion dollar asset cannot rely on the hope that a catastrophic breakthrough adheres to a predictable signpost schedule giving the many disparate parties involved time to agree all aspects of the fundamental changes to Bitcoin’s core protocol. In contrast, the board of a centralised commercial institution like a bank or a fund platform could move PDQ if required to implement post quantum cryptography. FWIW, my guess is that someone like North Korea’s now infamous Lazarus Group would, in the future, try and execute a heist / disruption Op like this, possibly with either active PRC assistance or their wilful blindness (Lazarus have been behind some of the very biggest and most challenging recent crypto hacks/thefts – they’re a front for the Reconnaissance General Bureau of the General Staff Department of the Korean Peoples’ Army and, it’s fair to say, are pretty hardcore and deep under the radar when it comes to these sorts of mischief). @TI “.. I think Bitcoin has time to adapt..”. The great thing about gold is that it doesn’t need to adapt. It’s elemental. Bitcoin, crypto.., is just a mathematical construct that will need lots of shape-shifting over time. Every time I think of bitcoin, the tech bros, and agent orange…, a huge “Uh.., no thanks..”, appears in my mind. “Meanwhile the rest of this article will help you go into all this with your eyes wide open.” Oh no it won’t. I remember the old Canadian joke: “A gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar standing next to it”. Softly softly flee from monkey. on a tangent, but similar in the entertainment level for people who enjoy watching crazy geopolitical gambling in etf price form: https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/j/jpmorgan-emerging-europe,-middle-east-and-afr (this is JEMA, the EM tracker that was about 80% Russia before 2022, note the premium/discount situation, and its correlation to Trump activity) Leave a Comment Name * Email * Website Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

Title: Ethereum price forecast: analysts reveal shocking targets after the $1.5B liquidation bloodbath
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ethereum-price-forecast-analysts-reveal-shocking-targets-after-the-1-5b-liquidation-bloodbath/

Ethereum price plunged into a violent sell-off on Monday, wiping out many leveraged long positions and rattling traders. Ethereum’s price has, however, rebounded slightly, with CoinGecko showing ETH trading around $4,197, with a 24-hour range near $4,125–$4,220 at press time. On Monday, Ethereum (ETH) fell roughly 15% alongside other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), triggering $1.5 billion in liquidations — the largest single event in six months. BIGGEST LIQUIDATION CASCADE EVER OVER $1B IN LONGS WIPED OUT IN A SINGLE HOUR THE REAL BLOODBATH 🩸 pic.twitter.com/3MPOw56O48 — AlΞx Wacy 🌐 (@wacy_time1) September 22, 2025 The sudden drop forced many leveraged long positions to close and pushed ETH toward a key psychological floor around $4,000. The price decline came even as institutional demand continued. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF registered roughly $512 million of inflows during the same sell-off, underscoring a divide between retail pressure and institutional accumulation. Technically, the market looks fragile. ETH recently broke a symmetrical triangle, a move that gives a measured downside target near $3,560 if selling persists. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe has flagged the $3,550–$3,750 area as a likely support zone, and he noted that the 20-week EMA sits close to $3,685. I think that we'll see some more chop occur on $ETH. I don't know whether we'll dip as deep as $3,550-3,750, but I'm sure that we'll start to see: – 20-Week MA is getting closer. – Compression is building up –> Big move to occur at a later time. It's now down nearly 20% from… pic.twitter.com/MUvUEYY4Xv — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 23, 2025 Short-term resistance bands now cluster between about $4,220 and $4,360. Below that, traders are watching $4,120, $4,050 and the critical $4,000 level. A decisive break under those supports could accelerate the decline toward roughly $3,800. Conversely, a clean bounce and a decisive close above the 50-day EMA near $4,250 would improve the odds of a sustained recovery. A second technical pattern of concern is a descending triangle that formed after August’s peak near $4,956. That structure keeps $4,070 as a make-or-break pivot. If $4,070 holds, the path to a retest of $5,000 reopens; if it fails, downside to $3,800 becomes more likely. On the bullish side, a string of analysts and macro studies argue that today’s weakness could set the stage for aggressive gains. Ted Pillows applied the Global M2 Money Supply chart to Ethereum and suggested a scenario that lands ETH between $18,000 and $20,000 by 2026. Global M2 supply is now projecting $18,000-$20,000 ETH by cycle top. Even if $ETH pulls half of that, it'll trade above $10,000. I'm still long-term bullish on Ethereum and think that a sweep of the $4,000 liquidity zone could happen before reversal. pic.twitter.com/w6ZZl0OuPI — Ted (@TedPillows) September 21, 2025 Other market voices back more modest but still impressive rallies. Daan de Rover and Fundstrat’s Mark Newton highlight a $5,500 target, with Newton adding that ETH is unlikely to drop much below $4,000. Institutional commitments have reinforced that sentiment; combined flows from large managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity reached hundreds of millions, a dynamic many analysts say supports higher prices over time. In addition, Crypto GEMs point to Wyckoff Accumulation scenarios and chart setups that could take ETH toward $7,000 if a spring and test sequence holds. Michaël van de Poppe himself argues that compression is building and that dips around current levels represent attractive accumulation opportunities for long-term buyers. Key datapoints to monitor are liquidity below $4,000, ETF inflows, and whether the 50-day EMA around $4,250 is reclaimed. Ethereum sits at a crossroads. The near term is binary: hold above $4,000 and bulls can chase higher targets; lose that floor and technical setups point to a deeper correction toward the mid-$3,000s. Longer term, robust institutional flows, tokenisation trends, and macro easing provide clear bullish arguments — some analysts even see five-figure and double-digit-thousand outcomes on the horizon. Traders and investors should watch liquidity, ETF flows, and moving-average confirmations to decide which path unfolds next.

Title: Thinking Small Drives Big Leaps In AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/thinking-small-drives-big-leaps-in-ai/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:23:41Z

ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. AI is an increasingly popular topic in the investment industry – for good reason. From its ability (or lack thereof) to facilitate investment research or pick winning stocks, the potential applications are broad. Like it or not, it’s clear that AI is going to change the investment industry in a big way. It started, mostly with hype, years ago, but there is more and more progress with each passing day. Some of the largest asset managers have already incorporated AI into their active ETFs. BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset manager in the world, provides an early case study. BlackRock first integrated AI/machine learning into active ETFs back in 2018 with the suite of ETFs under the “iShares Evolved” brand. This product line consisted of seven new funds which would pick holdings in industries based on machine learning and natural language processing. While the concept seemed promising, the results were not. Five of the seven funds were liquidated in 2022. Of the remaining 2 ETFs, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 since inception. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the outperforming ETF, now named iShares U.S. Tech Independence Focused ETF (IETC), focused on the high-flying tech sector. Why the lack of success? AI doesn’t perform well if it is fed poor training data. Whenever AI is involved, especially in a complex field like investing, the quality of the training data is the single most important factor to its success. Keep in mind that AI learns from its training data. It doesn’t know if its training data is wrong. It trusts it blindly. Unfortunately for users, current large language models (LLMs) fail miserably at understanding the meaning and nuances of financial data in filings because it has been trained using low quality financial data. Any stock picking or investment research system built on these models is using bad data, and everyone knows the timeless saying about models: garbage in – garbage out. If the financial models used to train the AI can’t generate alpha, AI isn’t going to do any better. AI isn’t a magic bullet. It cannot fix the data on which it is built. It’s a tool to replicate the work that human analysts do, but at scale. In fact, AI may perform worse than humans because it doesn’t have access to additional data on which its human counterparts rely on without realizing it. If big asset managers like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton (BEN), Invesco (IVZ), and others can’t find high-quality data to drive their AI solutions, I believe their stocks will face downward pressure. The only way for asset managers to differentiate their funds and hope to outperform the market more consistently is to leverage superior data to drive superior research. Otherwise, their only real differentiator is distribution, an advantage that has long been exhausted. There’s no better proof that the quality of training data is paramount to AI’s success than the mounting evidence that small language models (SLM) significantly outperform LLMs. The problem with LLMs is that they tend to rely heavily on the open internet for training, which is a data source filled with noise and inaccuracies. Traditional asset managers would never train human analysts by directing them to learn about investing by only reading the internet. Why anyone is training their AI analysts this way is unclear. As a result, these LLMs handle a broad range of general tasks reasonably well, but their performance declines sharply when faced with more sophisticated tasks. In contrast, SLMs focus on a narrower and more specific domain, which enables human experts to ensure the data is accurate and properly organized and that the rules about how to use the data produce reliable results. For example, the SLM created by New Constructs powers market-beating stock picking. I’m able to empirically prove the accuracy and reliability of the SLM because it is based on: I think the advantages of SLMs over LLMs are intuitive. Rather than trying to boil the ocean like LLMs, they narrow the scope to a small enough domain where human experts can truly curate a pristine dataset on which clear instructions can be built to produce truly reliable and human-expert level insights. See Figure 1, from this tweet, for a basic comparison of SLMs and LLMs. Figure 1: Comparing Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs)

Title: JPMorgan To Appear At Ripple Swell: What We Know So Far
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-ripple-swell/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T14:00:11Z
Full Content:
The XRP community’s rumor mill just met hard evidence: Ripple’s official Swell speaker roster now lists Scott Lucas, Head of Markets Digital Assets at JP Morgan, among this year’s presenters. Swell 2025 will take place in New York City on November 4–5 (welcome reception on November 3) at Convene Hudson Yards, with Ripple billing it as its ninth annual gathering of “leaders in crypto, blockchain, payments and policy.” JPMorgan’s appearance is part of a broader Wall Street tilt to the agenda. The same speakers page shows Maxwell Stein (Director, Digital Assets, BlackRock), Ryan Rugg (Global Head of Digital Assets, Treasury & Trade Solutions, Citi), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Head of Fidelity Digital Asset Management, Fidelity), and Kim Hochfeld (Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Cash, Digital & Securities Lending, State Street Investment Management). The published agenda assigns Stein to a capital-markets tokenization discussion with Moody’s, and pairs Rugg and Lo Bessette on a panel about how global banks are shaping digital assets at scale. As of publication, Lucas’s specific session was not listed on the agenda. Lineups are subject to change, but the current program underlines heavyweight TradFi participation. The listing triggered predictable chatter on X. James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) amplified the update with: “Now JPMorgan is going to be at Ripple Swell? 🍿” Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) went further, asserting: “JPMorgan put their Head of Digital Assets on stage at Ripple Swell 2025. XRP is fully integrated into the banking infrastructure … adoption is inevitable.” Those are community interpretations, not confirmations of product integrations or partnerships; the only verifiable fact at this point is Lucas’s inclusion on Ripple’s official speaker slate. Lucas’s remit at JP Morgan is directly relevant to what Swell typically explores. He oversees the strategy and execution of new trading products built on DLT/blockchain and represents the bank in industry initiatives; he also holds board roles at HQLAx and Ownera, and serves on the board of CLS Group—all touchpoints in the market plumbing of tokenized collateral, securities finance and post-trade. Context matters: JPMorgan has built one of the industry’s most advanced permissioned-blockchain stacks for wholesale finance. Its Onyx (now Kinexys Digital Assets) platforms span JPM Coin and tokenized-collateral rails used in repo and liquidity operations; recent milestones include tokenized MMF collateral and on-chain intraday repo workflows. That program has processed large volumes and is expanding to third-party apps—developments that dovetail with Swell’s tokenization and market-infrastructure themes. None of this implies an XRP integration; it does explain why a senior JP Morgan digital-assets executive belongs in the conversation Swell curates. What to watch from here is straightforward. First, Swell’s New York program already confirms BlackRock’s tokenization talk and a joint Citi–Fidelity panel on bank adoption—useful signaling about where institutional priorities sit in late 2025.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Chancellor Rachel Reeves will declare the UK ‘open for business’, following a £110 billion investment surge from major financial services firms in the past week alone. Global fintech leader Revolut will today (23 September) open its new global headquarters in Canary Wharf, setting out plans to invest £3 billion in the UK and create 1,000 high-skilled jobs over the next five years. This comes on the heels of last week’s £100 billion investment from asset manager Blackstone, £7 billion from BlackRock and £1.25 billion in inward investment from leading US financial firms including PayPal and Bank of America - generating 1,800 new jobs in major cities including London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Manchester. The wave of investment from financial services companies comes just months after the Chancellor cut needless financial red tape to ensure the UK wins the global race for financial services investment as part of the modern industrial strategy. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: The UK is well and truly open for business under this government. Through our Leeds Reforms we’re making Britain the best place for financial services companies to do business, pushing us ahead in the global race for investment and putting more money in people’s pockets through the Plan for Change. Nik Storonsky, CEO and Co-founder of Revolut, commented: Our mission has always been to simplify money for our customers, and our vision to become the world’s first truly global bank is the ultimate expression of that. From our roots here in the UK, we’ve grown to serve over 65 million customers globally, and today’s opening of our new Global HQ in London is the launchpad for our future. This HQ will be central to driving our growth towards our next milestone of 100 million customers. To power that journey from our home market, we are investing £3 billion in the UK over the next five years. This commitment will not only create 1,000 new jobs but will also fuel the innovation from our London hub that will help us deliver on our global ambitions. The major investments from financial services firms over the past week include: These investments in the UK are a vote of confidence in the UK’s economic plan, built on stability, investment and reform. The Leeds Reforms set out the widest ranging reforms to financial regulation in over a decade, making the UK more attractive to global financial services firms. This includes new support for fintech introducing tailored support to help FinTechs, with new start-ups getting a single regulatory point of contact to help them through the scale-up phase. The contact will be able to provide technical support to help them understand the regulatory requirements they need to meet in order to grow. Revolut’s investment marks its commitment to the UK, where it has grown to become a global fintech leader with more than 10,000 employees and revenues of over £3 billion. The company now serves over 65 million customers worldwide, including 12 million in the UK, and has set its sights on reaching 100 million customers globally by mid 2027. Revolut’s success exemplifies the strength of the UK’s fintech sector, which boasts around 3,000 firms supporting tens of thousands of skilled jobs nationwide.

Vardoulakis A blockchain is a distributed database where independent computers across the world maintain identical copies of a transaction record, updating it only when the network reaches consensus on new transactions—making the history transparent and extraordinarily difficult to alter. Historically, bonds have traded almost entirely in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, while equities and money market fund shares have largely settled through centralized infrastructures such as stock exchanges and central securities depositories. In both settings, each institution maintains its own records, and post-trade steps like confirmation, clearing, and settlement require multiple intermediaries and repeated reconciliation. Blockchain offers a different model: instead of fragmented books or a single central authority, all participants share a single, consensus-validated ledger of ownership and transactions. A tokenized asset—whether a bond, equity, or money market fund share—is a digital representation of that claim on the blockchain, with transfers recorded as direct updates to this shared ledger. While distributed ledgers are not inherently faster or cheaper than centralized systems, they differ in important ways: no single entity controls the record; programmable logic can automate corporate actions or enforce transfer restrictions; and auditability is native through an append-only history. In this way, blockchain replaces bilateral and centrally governed recordkeeping with a common ledger that is jointly maintained and verifiable in real time. While many types of assets have been tokenized to date, we focus on the tokenization of “money-like” investment funds that potentially allow for novel use cases. We provide a background of how these products have evolved and discuss their use cases. In a subsequent post, we examine the benefits and risks to financial stability from these products. Many types of assets have been tokenized to date, including real estate, commodities, agriculture, and other financial securities. But the bulk of tokenization activity in the United States has concentrated on two types of funds: money market funds (MMFs), which are open-end funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), and private funds that are exempt from registration under that Act. Several private funds have been proposed by large financial institutions, suggesting surging interest among market participants and the possibility of wider adoption. Private funds are exempt from many of the requirements in federal securities laws and regulations applicable to MMFs, including the 1940 Act’s disclosure requirements for investment companies. As a result, regulators and the public have little visibility into their operations, including whether they have instituted the same type of liquidity risk management tools as MMFs are required to implement (for example, portfolio maturity maximums and liquid asset minimums). Three prominent tokenized MMFs are Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX (AUM $708M), Circle/Hashnote’s USYC ($488M) and WisdomTree’s WTGXX ($10.8M); the largest tokenized private fund is BlackRock’s BUIDL (AUM $2.5B). The chart below shows the growth of these four tokenized funds. Total Assets Under Management of Select Tokenized Funds Three prominent use cases of tokenized funds have been developed to date, all of which are novel as they have historically not been available to investment funds due to numerous legal, regulatory, and/or market reasons. See, for example, “Lessons from the History of the U.S. Regulatory Perimeter” for how the legal perimeter has evolved in the United States, separating deposit liabilities, which are considered legal payment instruments, from other types such as investment funds’ liabilities, which are not. Use Case I: Development of a Secondary Market and Instantaneous Liquidity Pools Investors may want to hold tokenized shares beyond their traditional function as a store of value. For example, tokenization allows shares to circulate as a medium of exchange in secondary markets. Such a possibility would be facilitated by innovative efforts to offer immediate liquidity against tokenized shares. For instance, some fund issuers have established processes by which their tokenized shares can be exchanged for more widely used means of digital-asset payments, namely stablecoins. A prominent example is the smart-contract-controlled pool where BUIDL and FOBXX are instantaneously exchangeable for USDC, the second-biggest stablecoin by market capitalization. These initiatives enable a deeper integration of tokenized funds with the digital-asset ecosystem, thereby increasing benefits to investors of tokenized funds, as they can use their shares to transact in ways historically unavailable to such shares. Use Case II: Reserve Asset for DeFi-based Products Tokenization can also facilitate the use of the shares to be used as a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem. For example, at least three DeFi-based products use BUIDL as a reserve asset. One such product is Ondo Finance’s “Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries” (OUSG). Recently, Ondo announced it would exchange shares of OUSG for shares in four tokenized MMFs (FOBXX, WTGXX, and two international funds). Ondo plans to then hold the acquired shares as part of OUSG’s reserve assets which are predominantly made up of BUIDL. In essence, OUSG serves as an example of the secondary market functionality discussed above with an increased role for tokenized shares to be a store of value in the digital-asset ecosystem, while also providing additional liquidity for token holders given the 24/7 on-off ramp in which tokenized funds can be indirectly exchanged for stablecoins. While Ondo could have used stablecoins as collateral directly, this would have been less attractive as a store of value since stablecoins do not pay interest. In addition, both Mountain Protocol’s stablecoin and the rebranded FRAX stablecoin claim that BUIDL comprises a portion of their reserve assets. Use Case III: Collateral for Derivatives A third use case for tokenized shares is posting margins for repurchase agreements and derivatives transactions. Bloomberg reports that two of the world’s largest crypto prime brokers allow clients, including hedge funds, to use BlackRock’s BUIDL as collateral for crypto-based derivatives trading and are in early talks with some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges to expand this offering. Moreover, Circle recently purchased Hashnote, the issuer of the world’s largest tokenized MMF to “emerge as a preferred form of yield-bearing collateral on crypto exchanges, and also with custodians and prime brokers.” Meanwhile, in traditional derivatives, JPMorgan Chase facilitated a transaction in which tokenized BlackRock MMF shares were pledged as collateral with Barclays for a derivatives contract, although there haven’t been any additional transactions to date. It is too early to tell what impact, if any, tokenized shares will have on the financial system. Thus far tokenized shares have been mainly facilitating use cases within the digital-asset ecosystem. While there exists a lot of opacity in how these tokenized funds are being used as well as limited evidence of broader acceptance so far, interconnections between the traditional financial system and digital assets could increase if these products are used more broadly by market participants in the future.

The feature was enabled through a smart contract, which now serves as another off-ramp for products offered by asset managers BlackRock and VanEck, according to a press release. It functions 24/7, allowing users to access instant liquidity, Ripple added. Ripple’s stablecoin debuted in December. And although it’s much smaller than alternatives offered by Tether and Circle, RLUSD has grown to a market capitalization of $740 million within the past year, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In a statement, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, described the move as a “natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” noting that RLUSD was designed specifically for institutional use. Securitize made a similar announcement nearly a year ago, saying that Circle’s USDC had been integrated into its platform as a way to reduce investment costs and streamline the subscription process for investing in BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). BlackRock’s BUDIL is worth $2 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. Around 90 qualified investors hold shares in the fund, which is tokenized on several blockchains, including Solana, Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, and layer-2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL), which can also be exchanged for RLUSD on Securitize’s platform, is worth $74 million, while only having 14 different holders. Shares in BUIDL and VBILL are represented by tokens that change hands at $1, but unlike most stablecoins, they offer investors a yield. Products issued through Securitize’s platform do not yet exist on XRP Ledger, but Tuesday’s announcement notes that “additional use cases and assets [are] planned,” while Securitize will “expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem” through its own moves. On Monday, Ripple unveiled an updated roadmap for XRPL, highlighting new compliance features like the ability for token issuers to “deep freeze” wallet addresses and a method for being able to “dry run” transactions. “Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. “Together, we’re delivering real-time settlement and programmable liquidity across a new class of compliant, on-chain investment products.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Snowflake-led coalition targets data fragmentation with vendor-neutral semantic standard

UPDATED 09:00 EDT / SEPTEMBER 23 2025 by Paul Gillin Snowflake Inc. and a group of partners today launched the Open Semantic Interchange initiative, an open-source effort to standardize how organizations define and share business semantics across data and analytics platforms. The initiative aims to create a vendor-neutral specification for business metrics, dimensions and metadata that can be used consistently across business intelligence tools, data catalogs and artificial intelligence applications. The 17 initial participants include Salesforce, BlackRock Inc. and dbt Labs Inc. Data semantics describe the meaning and context of data relative to business concepts, processes and rules. For example, consistent semantics ensure that different systems and teams interpret terms like “customer,” “revenue” and “operating margin” the same way. Many organizations manage business metrics across multiple BI and analytics systems, each with its own set of semantic definitions. That leads to duplication of effort and inconsistent definitions. The initiative is an effort to resolve those differences. “A strong request from customers has been to make semantic models interoperable,” said Josh Klahr, director of analytics product management at Snowflake. “They want to make it easy for a model in one place to show up in another location, avoid the risk of vendor lock-in and think about interoperability for the long term.” The effort will initially focus on analytics and BI use cases with an additional emphasis on enabling AI interfaces to work with consistent, verified data definitions. Work on the specification has just begun, with a working group defining the first version of a draft standard that’s likely to be published within the next few months, Klahr said. Numerous technology- and industry-specific semantic standards already exist, with several administered by the World Wide Web Consortium. The standard is expected to build on existing approaches where possible, using widely adopted formats such as YAML to define metrics, hierarchies and relationships. “YAML will likely end up being the definition language,” Klahr said. Snowflake said the initiative will probably be donated to either the Apache Software Foundation or the Linux Foundation. “It’s early to say which because we want the working group to agree on what the licensing model will be,” Klahr said, “but the plan is to be an open-source project.” The company expects the list of participating vendors to grow rapidly. “There’s lots of interest,” Klahr said. “This is something that makes sense to everybody.” Snowflake rival Databricks Inc. isn’t a founding member, but “I would love for additional partners like Databricks to be part of the effort as well,” he said.

Title: From Goldman To AI: How Rishi Bali Is Building Wall Street’s Transformation Layer With OPCO.AI

BySindhya Valloppillil, Contributor. Finance runs on spreadsheets. OPCO.AI thinks that’s a $1 trillion risk. Wall Street’s next alpha isn’t in trading — it’s in AI infrastructure. If and when the credit cycle tightens, the dominoes don’t ask permission: one missed covenant, one delayed NAV, one reconciliation error in an inbox. Private markets still run too much on PDFs and spreadsheets; in a storm, that’s a fault line.. One firm betting that alpha now depends as much on the pipes as on the trade is OPCO.AI—founded by Goldman veteran Rishi Bali. OPCO.AI describes itself as Wall Street’s transformation layer — a builder that fuses risk, operations, and technology into a single, AI-powered operating core. After three decades building the machinery of modern finance — from Goldman’s credit desks and derivatives prime brokerage to multi-strategy hedge funds and private platforms — Bali is betting the edge in the next era won’t come from squeezing another basis point out of trades, but from sealing the basis points that leak out of broken workflows. Private Equity & Private Credit. The buyout playbook thrived on cheap leverage. Then rates spiked to decade highs. Banks, constrained by post-GFC rules, stepped back from riskier lending, and private equity stepped in. Private credit — once niche — is now one of finance’s fastest-growing corners, fueled by deep insurance capital (think Apollo/Athene, KKR/Global Atlantic). But while capital has institutionalized, the operating infrastructure hasn’t. Covenants and borrowing bases live in PDFs. Amendments move through email. Risk engines are patchy; finance systems creak; investor reporting lags. In a benign cycle, those gaps stay hidden. Under stress, they become systemic weaknesses. Growth-stage VC and crossover funds increasingly resemble PE in their structures and scale — and they too face rising expectations from institutional LPs for faster reporting, stronger controls, and more resilient infrastructure. Industry outlooks peg private markets at roughly $13 trillion today on a path toward $20 trillion by 2030, and fundraising in private credit has concentrated among experienced managers in the higher-rate era — a winner-take-most dynamic that raises the bar for operating maturity. The more immediate risk is toxic operations, not toxic assets—covenant data trapped in PDFs can be more dangerous than any single borrower. The systemic-risk debate here is well covered elsewhere (see recent WSJ interviews with Jamie Dimon and Sixth Street’s Alan Waxman, and FT coverage on opacity/retail exposure); this piece focuses on the operating spine rather than relitigating that debate. Counterpoint (brief): Not all agree private credit is systemic. FT has argued that fund lockups, hard redemption caps, and diversified lender bases blunt contagion risk. The operating burden still rises either way — especially on covenant data, valuations, and investor transparency. Hedge Funds. The two-and-twenty model faces a new math. Performance pressure in front; legacy systems in back. Many funds still run on 20-year-old risk/accounting stacks. Shadow accounting doubles effort; no-shadow outsourcing introduces fresh fragility. As complexity rises — from structured credit to CLO warehousing — manual reconciliations become existential. Allocators and regulators want near real-time views. Markets deliver macro, tariff, and geopolitical shocks on their own schedule. The result: sophistication at the strategy layer riding on creaky pipes underneath. Meanwhile, industry AUM has pushed to record territory — north of ~$4.5 trillion (HFR) — intensifying the need for industrial-grade controls and reporting. Recent fundraising barometers are widely covered (Bloomberg on Jain Global’s $5.3B debut; Bloomberg on D.E. Shaw’s human-run fund), underscoring a winner-take-most dynamic and closer scrutiny on infrastructure. In tight-spread markets, operational accuracy matters as much as strategy—the speed of reconciliation and provable lineage can outweigh another trading signal. Family Offices. Founder liquidity created a wave of family offices — and a governance gap. Too many run on ad hoc spreadsheets, basic custodial statements, or the wrong jurisdictional setups. The tools exist (Addepar/Mirador), but tools without institutional discipline don’t create controls. Moving from concentrated founder wealth to institutional portfolios requires operating rigor — policies, risk frameworks, and consolidated reporting — or concentration and operational risks compound quietly. Estimates for the number of family offices range widely — from ~8,000 to well over 10,000 globally — underscoring both growth and opacity in this segment. The reputational risk isn’t performance; it’s process opacity—allocators notice sloppy dashboards and inconsistent closes. Banks. Even with regulators watching, legacy cores and offshored processes have left surveillance, compliance, and trade-monitoring underinvested. For investment banks and capital markets players alike, financial governance and infrastructure modernization have become survival issues. Fines, model risk, and AI governance expectations have made “now or never” modernization unavoidable. Customers expect near real-time; fintechs set the bar; cyber risk expands with every integration. The U.S. shift to T+1 settlement compressed operational timelines further. Recent actions illustrate the cost of lagging controls: in 2024, U.S. regulators levied roughly $250 million (OCC) and $98.2 million (Federal Reserve) in penalties tied to surveillance deficiencies at a large U.S. bank; the CFTC added $200 million (with up to $100 million credit for overlapping issues). The choice is stark: pay later in penalties and reputation, or invest now in resilient operating backbones. Being “regulated” isn’t the same as being resilient; in 2025, model/AI governance is the new capital ratio. Bali’s conviction is that AI isn’t a bolt-on tool; it’s a new operating paradigm. OPCO.AI positions itself as building an Operations Intelligence Layer — a governed data spine that fuses risk, operations, and technology with explainable automation, clear lineage, and human-in-the-loop AI copilots. His vantage point was earned in the trenches: Goldman Sachs Rates & Credit in the late 1990s, helping stand up the firm’s credit infrastructure as the asset class grew from a sidecar to a core engine; launching derivatives prime brokerage to support multi-asset hedge funds; then senior roles at D.B. Zwirn, UBS Dillon Read, Alphadyne, and Citigroup Tribeca Global Management. He also built a Made-in-USA technical apparel brand with institutional capital — a founder’s lesson in execution and design that now shows up in OPCO.AI’s doctrine: design is a control. OPCO.AI is a builders’ shop, not a slide factory. Senior operators collapse risk, ops, and tech into a single source of truth, run pre‑mortems to contain blast radius, and treat design as a control. The team executes fast, hands the capability back, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer exceptions, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. At Goldman, Bali watched credit evolve from an offshoot of rates into a full asset class — investment grade, high yield, CDO/CLO warehousing, credit reinsurance — and helped architect the operating controls those desks needed to scale. Extending prime brokerage beyond equities into credit, rates, and FX required entirely new models of risk and reconciliation. Today, as private markets take on the scale and scrutiny once reserved for public markets, the operating burden has multiplied. OPCO.AI is his vehicle for applying that experience at buy-side scale. Every engagement starts with a one‑line brief — the sharpest statement of pain (e.g., “Covenant monitoring is broken,” “Month‑end takes 15 days,” “We have three versions of P&L”). From that single sentence, the team expands it into a working system the client owns: documented workflows, reconciliations, controls, and governance. Within ~60 days, a live data model and automated reconciliations establish provable lineage and seal the first cracks; by ~120 days, 60–80% of repetitive workflows are automated, exceptions are routed and tracked, investor reporting accelerates, and risk and finance speak to a single source of truth. The Target Operating Model is then institutionalized: the Current State is benchmarked, the Ideal State is defined (provable lineage, automated recs, consistent reporting, embedded controls), and a Future State path is laid out (agentic workflows, real‑time risk) aligned to mandate and culture. OPCO.AI hands back the capability with clean documentation and durable design, and measures success in hard outcomes: fewer breaks, faster closes, cleaner audits, and basis points saved. Discovery maps a fund’s operating DNA — beyond “the close is slow” to the root causes: lineage gaps, control breaks, and seams between risk, ops, and tech. From that mandate, the team designs toward the Target Operating Model and executes on two tracks at once: tactical fixes (automate the highest‑pain reconciliations, stabilize data feeds, standardize investor reporting) and strategic rebuild (a governed data spine that unifies risk/finance/ops with near‑real‑time NAV/P&L and designed workflows). Embedded throughout is Risk Diagnostics across three dimensions — efficiency, operational robustness, and regulatory resilience — which prioritize what to fix first, how to contain exceptions, and how to evidence compliance. The outcome is a solutions layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. The outcome is a Solutions Layer the client owns: harmonized with legacy, auditable by design, and ready for AI agents. Most finance UX feels like 1995. OPCO.AI builds cockpit-grade interfaces (Python/React) where clarity is a control. On the AI side, MCP acts like a USB port for agents across fragmented systems, with lineage preserved. The next frontier: agentic AI with DLT-based proof-of-human/intent, so every action is authenticated, authorized, and auditable. Consultants. The Big Four (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) dominate operations and risk consulting. Their strengths are clear: global scale, regulatory expertise, and armies of specialists who can handle audits, model validation, and remediation at size. The trade‑offs are equally well known: long timelines, junior‑heavy staffing pyramids, and deliverables that skew toward diagnostics and governance artifacts over shipped systems. Large programs can drift into “transformation theater,” where steering committees multiply but on‑desk change lags. Conflicts (audit vs. advisory) and complex RACI structures can also slow decisions, which matters when firms need working controls in weeks, not quarters. Fund Administrators. SS&C, Citco, State Street, Northern Trust, Apex and others provide NAV calculation, investor services, and regulatory filings at industrial scale. Their advantages: deep control frameworks, established SLAs, and familiarity with the dominant accounting stacks (e.g., Geneva, VPM). Limitations arise when administrators are asked to redesign front‑to‑back workflows: customization is constrained, change management is ticket‑driven, and integration across risk/ops/finance can be slow. The mandate is to keep accurate books, not to re‑architect operating models. As more managers experiment with “no‑shadow” setups, the quality of reconciliations, exception handling, and data lineage becomes a central dependency — and a potential bottleneck. Technology Platforms. Arcesium, SEI Novus, Allvue, BlackRock Aladdin, iCapital, and Addepar each offer powerful tools, but generally in siloed domains. Arcesium, spun out of D.E. Shaw, provides portfolio accounting and reconciliation systems. SEI Novus emphasizes analytics and manager intelligence for allocators. Allvue delivers fund accounting and investor reporting software to private capital managers. BlackRock’s Aladdin is the dominant risk and portfolio management platform for asset owners, but was designed primarily with the perspective of institutions like pension funds, not buy-side funds. iCapital has built a strong platform for alternative investment access and distribution, while Addepar focuses on consolidated reporting for family offices and wealth managers. Each of these platforms has become essential in its niche, yet most were not built to integrate seamlessly across the full workflow of private credit, hedge funds, and multi-strategy platforms. Niche AI/Data Startups. Players like Canoe Intelligence, FundGuard, Hazeltree, or 73 Strings focus on automating narrow slices of fund operations. Canoe specializes in extracting and structuring data from fund documents, FundGuard applies cloud-native tech to accounting and NAV oversight, Hazeltree handles treasury and liquidity management, and 73 Strings provides valuation and portfolio monitoring.Each addresses real pain points, but they operate as point solutions. Their limitation is that they rarely integrate across the full operating stack, leaving firms with improved pockets of efficiency but without an overarching infrastructure layer. Boutique Consultancies. Smaller shops exist, but they lack global reach and the institutional lineage of larger players. Their impact is often limited by scale. So what? The market is crowded with capable specialists — consultants for governance, administrators for books, platforms for slices of the workflow, and AI point‑solutions for specific tasks — but few offerings bridge them into a unified, governed operating spine. Managers that can prove real‑time lineage, faster closes, exception containment, and audit‑ready automation are the ones winning allocator trust — and, increasingly, capital. What could go wrong? Operational rewiring rarely ships on Gantt charts. Integrations sprawl, legacy data fights back, and AI systems raise governance questions — explainability, audit trails, and model drift. There’s vendor‑dependency risk, too: moving reconciliations and covenant parsing into a single layer concentrates failure unless controls are designed for containment. The bet here is that disciplined design, human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, and provable lineage can shrink that blast radius. Over the last decade, capital migrated: private credit exploded, hedge funds scaled, family offices multiplied, and even banks offshored in search of efficiency. But the pipes never caught up. The operating burden now looks like a bank’s — without bank-grade controls. Data lineage can’t be proven. Valuation governance lacks audit trails. Investor reporting takes weeks, not hours. The next stress may not come from asset blowups alone — but from operational failures in reconciliation, surveillance, and governance that magnify them. OPCO.AI’s wager is clear: if Wall Street is going to withstand its next test, it won’t be thanks to another clever trade. It will be because the infrastructure held — transforming operations into alpha.

Title: Exclusive: Fast-growing crypto and stablecoin startup Zerohash raises $104 million

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. A recent flood of institutional demand for blockchain technology has helped to mint a new unicorn. Zerohash, a crypto and stablecoin infrastructure company headquartered in Chicago, announced Tuesday that it had raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation. Interactive Brokers, a publicly traded brokerage, led the round. In a crowded field of infrastructure companies, Zerohash has carved out a name for itself by helping financial institutions and fintechs build out their own products for stablecoins, crypto trading, and tokenization. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, and tokenization refers to putting financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Other participants in the startup’s fundraise included traditional finance giants like Morgan Stanley and Apollo Global Management. The publicly traded fintech SoFi and the crypto arm of the high-frequency trading firm Jump Trading also contributed, among others. The $1 billion valuation marks a significant jump from Zerohash’s last round in 2022, when it raised at a $340 million valuation, according to Pitchbook. The data aggregator’s estimate is “about accurate,” said Edward Woodford, founder and CEO of Zerohash, but he declined to specify his company’s valuation in its prior fundraise. The near tripling in Zerohash’s worth signals how crypto, which contracted from 2022 to 2024, is now riding another wave of hype. And the traditional finance institutions backing the startup are evidence of how Wall Street investors, not just a ragtag group of cypherpunk libertarians, are driving the market’s recent surge. “Crypto now is not a debated issue at this point at large institutional banks,” said Woodford. Although Woodford has been in crypto for almost a decade, he’s no cypherpunk. In 2015, he graduated from MIT with a master’s degree in finance and launched a swaps platform for emerging commodities, like industrial hemp. He sold the business in 2017 to the brokerage Tastytrade, and, that same year, Woodford went on to build a new company. That business has cycled through a variety of names and stylizations—Seed CX, Zero #, Zero Hash, and now Zerohash—but it’s always focused on building crypto infrastructure for financial institutions. Over eight years, Woodford has managed to ride multiple crypto booms and busts. “It’s not just that we’re a survivor,” he said. “We’ve actually thrived in that market, and actually now, I think we can accelerate that even further.” But it’s this cycle of crypto, where every Wall Street firm appears to be piling into digital assets amid pro–crypto regulation from President Donald Trump, that seems to be tailor-made for Zerohash. “It’s not that they weren’t doing any work on this stuff already,” Woodford, referring to financial institutions. “But they just weren’t able to move into the space, and now there’s a clear path for them to be able to do so.” While Woodford wouldn’t disclose his startup’s revenue or whether it was profitable, he did say Zerohash has increased its topline each year over the past three years, even during the Crypto Winter of 2022 through 2024. Zerohash, which has about 200 employees, has three business verticals. It develops a white-labeled crypto brokerage that companies like Interactive Brokers can spin up to more easily let their customers buy and sell digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has APIs for tokenization, which has helped, for example, BlackRock tokenize money market funds. And it builds stablecoin networks to let customers, including Stripe, more easily send and receive the tokens. “Zerohash has been able to grow with headwinds,” said Woodford. “Imagine what it looks like with tailwinds.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Wow, what can I say? Jamie Majera is head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business, as well as running their retirement business. BlackRock is the $12 trillion investment giant, the biggest asset manager in the world. Jamie is been working for the firm effectively since 2001, where she began at Merrill Lynch investment managers, which was merged with BlackRock in oh six. She’s risen through the ranks and has really seen every aspect of the wealth management and product services, everything from iShares to their alpha products to alternatives. She has quite a fascinating history, and there are a few people better able to describe and discuss how the wealth management business is changing and where it’s going. Then her, I, I found this conversation to be fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, BlackRock’s head of US Wealth Advisory Business. Jamie Mara, Jaime Magyera: It is so good to be here. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so good to have you. I’ve been looking forward to this conversation, but I wanna, before we get up to, to the US wealth advisory business of and retirement business of BlackRock, let’s talk a little bit about your background. You go to University of Pennsylvania undergraduate. What’d you study? What was the plan? Jaime Magyera: So I studied psychology. I went to University of Pennsylvania. My brother went there as well. My sister went there as well. Psychology major. I, I didn’t have a plan. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I was that kid that loved working. So I had, you know, any job I had when I was growing up, I just loved, I was a babysitter. I worked at a bakery, I taught tennis lessons. I did it all, and I loved it. Taught tennis… Barry Ritholtz: Are you any good? You still play? Jaime Magyera: I’m incredible. You play regular. Don’t ask my husband Barry Ritholtz: Singles or Doubles? Jaime Magyera: So I don’t play well or regularly any longer. There is a story behind that, which maybe I’ll share with you, but my husband does play tennis. He’s incredible, and he coaches at West Point. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, That’s amazing. Yeah. Yeah. So what was the first gig, right? Outta U Penn? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, so, so, you know, I was a psychology major and I knew that I was fascinated with people and also with distribution, and I’ll come on that in a second, because I was a music person. I loved music. I wanted to be in the music industry. So my plan was do I go FBI criminal psychology, or do I go into the music industry? Barry Ritholtz: Very similar, And I’m not being sarcastic because you’re profiling people who perhaps have certain deviant perspectives about the world. Yeah. Jaime Magyera: I’ll leave it there. Okay. And so I, I had to make a decision, and so I, I was going towards the music industry, and so people always say, well, were you a performer? Did you sing? Were you classically trained? The answer is no. But I was fascinated with the business of music and the distribution of music. And so at that time, remember it was kind of Napster, right? So like, things were going Barry Ritholtz: From wait, like late nineties? Is that what you’re talking about? Yeah. Jaime Magyera: Oh yeah. So we’re going from CDs to digital distribution, and I just found it to be fascinating and, and what did that mean for the business and the implications for artists? And so I had this dream. I was going to be a big time record label exec. I had internships. I got a job at the time. It was Sony, BMG. Oh, sure. And then I realized as I got my offer letter that I wasn’t quite sure how I was going to, you know, sustain my life, pay my bills, my parents helped massively with college, but there was some student debt that I had to pay off. And so at the time, my brother was a financial advisor, and so I called him up and I said, Hey, big bro, what do you recommend? What should I do? And I was thinking he’d give me some financial advice, and his advice was, get a real job that’s going to help you pay your bills, and then you can go back into music after. And so that’s kind of how I made my way into finance. Barry Ritholtz: So what was the real job? Jaime Magyera: The real job was working at Merrill Lynch investment. Barry Ritholtz: So your whole career, you’ve been in the same, I’ve been more or less the same place. That’s amazing. Jaime Magyera: Yeah. And, and it, and there’s this theme as you kind of look through different things I’ve done throughout my career, but I started at Merrill Investment Managers, which was the asset management arm of, of Merrill Lynch. And I wanted to be the, the farthest thing away from markets because I had no experience, I didn’t know what the markets were, I didn’t even know what a mutual fund was. And so I joined Merrill as an analyst in their analyst program, and I was a technology project manager. Barry Ritholtz: Wait, so as an analyst, did you become a CFA? Did you go through that process or…? Jaime Magyera: No, I did not. So you get all of your series sevens and everything else, but I was responsible for, again, let’s date ourselves here. The late nineties, early two thousands e-business was the thing, right? So it, how do you… Barry Ritholtz: Gonna be big one day, it’s Jaime Magyera: There’s this whole thing called the internet. And so at the time, Merrill did not even have a website for their financial advisors. Barry Ritholtz: How is that possible? Jaime Magyera: I know. Can you imagine 2001? Barry Ritholtz: Yep. We’re gonna, we’re gonna wait and see if this thing becomes big takes off… Jaime Magyera: Right. I have a feeling. Right. So that’s, I feel Barry Ritholtz: I have a good feeling about this one. Jaime Magyera: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So’s that’s unbelievable. That’s kind of where I started, and it was, Barry Ritholtz: So did you help build out the first set of Merrill Lynch websites? Yeah. For their, is this for outward facing for clients, internally for advisors and brokers, or a little bit of everything for advisors and brokers. Jaime Magyera: And so that’s where I first learned, you know, the role of the financial advisor and what it is to be a financial advisor and how you serve your clients and how hard it is and what it is to actually sell and support and serve those financial advisors. But that was the job. It was translating technology, speak into business and client needs. Hmm. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. Yeah. So I know you’ve had multiple, multiple roles at both Merrill and BlackRock. Let’s quickly walk up the ladder. Yeah. So from that, what was the next role? Jaime Magyera: So, I always had this, this idea that I wanted to get closer to the client. So I would move, and you’ll see my, for my career, I moved into roles that were closer to clients. So from there, I went into marketing, which you really learned strategic messaging and how to simplify and, and help people understand what you’re doing. I then went into our retirement business where there, I, I used to help participants understand how to enroll in their 401k plan. I mean, literally going around the country, helping people figure out how to save and how to invest. And then I moved back into the wealth business, which is where I am today, along with leading our retirement business. And the wealth business was the first time when I came back into it that I actually had direct client accountability. And that was important to me because I had done technology and marketing and product and strategy and everything else, but I had never been responsible for helping to solve client problems directly. Barry Ritholtz: And, and to clarify, you didn’t just kinda move into the wealth business. You are the head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business that is not like just, you’re not just casually drifting into that space. You are running it. So, so let’s talk a little bit about how you got there. So Maryland BlackRock merged in 2006 when the dust settled. What was your title back then? Jaime Magyera: So back then I had moved into marketing, and I was the head of marketing for our wealth business. Then fast forward to BlackRock, acquired BGI and iShares, Barry Ritholtz: I recall one the greatest acquisitions in finance history Jaime Magyera:And, and a and a theme for BlackRock on just structural growth and how we view where, where the world is going and how we meet the needs to be there. But at that point, leadership had asked me to bring together all of the retirement businesses that were legacy BlackRock, legacy, iShares, legacy BGI, and I was part of that team working, Barry Ritholtz: In other words, turn it into one, one unified company instead of all these separate pieces. Jaime Magyera: That’s right, Barry Ritholtz: That’s right. How long did that process take? Jaime Magyera: It was, I mean, every day was another step in that process. And, you know, we learn over the years how important it is to integrate and to acquire. When you acquire, you’re acquiring for capabilities, but you’re acquiring for talent and culture. And so the match between the firms is really strong. And that helped us to integrate even faster. Barry Ritholtz: So, so you began this process late 2006, and right around the corner comes to financial crisis. How did that get in the way or affect this entire post-merger situation? It had to be pretty disruptive, certainly on the client level. How did it affect what you were doing? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, I mean, it, of course it was disruptive. And, and I think this kind of goes back to part of the vision with BlackRock always was, and I I mentioned the term structural growth, but what does that really mean? It means durable engines of growth, resilient engine of growth, growth that can persist market cycles. And so even through a financial crisis, the fact that we had our iShares ETF range, we had fixed income, we had equity, we had cash, we had everything you could imagine. And we had Aladdin, remember Aladdin, our technology platform was massively helpful to so many firms and institutions and, and governments during that time. So we had multiple ways to, to lead through that and help our clients through that crisis. Barry Ritholtz: Really, really quite fascinating. And back then, you know, it was a couple of trillion dollars. Now BlackRock is what, 11, $12 trillion? 12? [Yep]. That the largest asset manager in the world. I wanna say Vanguard is probably 10, 20% behind you, nipping at your heels. But between Vanguard and BlackRock, these are two of the most storied firms. And in fact, the new CEO of Vanguard used to run a division over at BlackRock, Jaime Magyera: Great friend of mine, ce, which, really just goes to tell, Barry Ritholtz: I recall interviewing him when he was at, at BlackRock, and like, huh, that guy’s gonna go somewhere one day. Jaime Magyera: But what’s fascinating is just how unbelievably successful the I share business became. But it, people tend to think of, retail investors tend to think about BlackRock in terms of iShares, but BlackRock is really so much more, it’s not only passive beta, but there are alpha seeking strategies. And as we’ll discuss later, there are alternatives. So there are a lot of things going on at BlackRock as head of the US Wealth advisory. What is the core focus? What are, what are the balls that you keep in the air all the time? Jaime Magyera: Yeah. So one of the things I love about the wealth business generally is that it is changing so rapidly. It’s dynamic every day there is something new investor preferences are changing, there’s different client segments. And as you said, it’s not just about iShares. I mean, we have so many capabilities that we can bring to bear. And so when we wake up every day, what we think about at BlackRock is how do we make investing easier, right? How do we get more people access to the capital markets? And that used to be public markets, now it’s public and private markets. But that’s what we do. And when you think about our wealth business, we do that through financial advisors and with wealth management firms. So our job in our wealth business is to help advisors and the firms that they work for build better portfolios for their clients so that they can achieve their dreams. And we aim to power their growth to help them scale their businesses so that they can do what they do best, which is serving their clients. And so that’s what we wake up doing every single day in the wealth business. Barry Ritholtz: So I’ve seen a variety of various BlackRock model portfolios. If you have a a, a a bond ladder that you have concerns about, you can run it by the BlackRock folks. And, hey, here are your options. We really haven’t talked about sma, which I know is a really fast growing part of the business. Is there a priority or are all these things just day by day, you’re just checking off different boxes and working on different projects? Jaime Magyera: Yeah, so our priority is, is serving the client, meeting their need. And when we look at the wealth market and talk to advisors every single day, there’s really three call ’em, client segments, investor segments that advisors are trying to serve and, and win and build relationships with. And we’re trying to help the advisor do so. So those three segments, think about the next gen investor, think about women, and think about high net worth. And we’ll hit on kind of direct indexing and everything that we do through that. But if you think about those three segments, and it’s a broad way to think about this, you know, there’s exceptions to every rule here, but next gen, what are we talking about? It’s the millennials, right? It’s, it’s, it’s Barry Ritholtz: And Gen Z, right? And Gen Z, Jaime Magyera: it’s 44% of the population. So it is a massive number by quantity, but it’s also a massive number by assets, right? That generation is going to inherit 70 trillion plus in assets over the next few years. And so what’s interesting and what’s different about these folks is that they want to invest in line with their beliefs. They’re incredibly tech savvy. In fact, they trust digital and social more than they might even trust humans these days. But they want advice from advisors, and they want to invest in things that are new and interesting. And so you think about Bitcoin, right? Bitcoin, 80 plus percent of millennial millionaires hold crypto. They’re more inclined to use crypto than stocks and mutual funds. So what we were doing and investing and innovating in, in service of client demand is creating a, a Bitcoin ETFI bet. Barry Ritholtz: One of, if not the fastest growing ETF in history, fastest to a billion, to 5 billion to 10 billion. I haven’t even looked at what it is. Jaime Magyera: 85 Billion Barry Ritholtz: UN unbelievable. This is less than two years old, right? Yes. Yes. That’s incredible. Yeah. $85 billion. Yep. And no passwords, no loss this no that they, they’ve taken what was a, you know, whenever I see the return claims for, for Bitcoin, I always have to point out, hey, 20, 30% of coins have been lost, lost passwords have been lost. Drives break. So subtract a third of off of that. Yeah. But really it’s, it’s this or zero if you totally lost it, you guys have made this a, a traditional financial product. Yeah. So it, it’s pretty amazing. And we’ve seen like a general acceptance of, hey, everybody should have 1% or maybe a little more, a little less, whatever your needs are of some Bitcoin. And this seems to be the easiest way to do it. Jaime Magyera: I think we’ll see a lot more of that too. I think we’re going to see a lot of firms coming out now to say, we are actually going to allow advisors to incorporate this into portfolios on the fee-based side on the advisory platforms. And so I think this is just the beginning, but it’s also just a perfect example of if you understand where clients are going and you have the capability set to innovate and build products around it, then you can deliver those products to market and help advisors better serve their clients. Barry Ritholtz: And I bid’s a perfect example of that. Yep. Really, really quite fascinating coming up, we continue our conversation with Jamie Majera, head of BlackRock’s US Wealth advisory business and head of BlackRock’s retirement business, discussing wealth management and retirement. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m speaking this week with Jamie Majera. She’s head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business as well as retirement business. So, so let’s talk a little bit about both of these. I wanna start with the wealth management business. This is more than just iShares. This is very holistic and comprehensive. Tell us a little bit about the US wealth advisory business. Jaime Magyera: So our business is really focused on helping those advisors who are really trying to go after multiple client segments and, and help those client segments actually meet their goals. And so, you know, we talked a little bit about next gen and kind of the millennials and Gen Z. The other segment that is just growing in incredible rates is women. Women today control a third of the world’s assets. In a few years it’ll be 50%, it’ll be 70% by 2050, Barry Ritholtz: 70%. Wow. Jaime Magyera: 70%. And you know, part of this is, let’s talk about what’s driving this. Women are creating wealth, right? More women are having careers or reaching executive levels or starting their own businesses. Women are also inheriting wealth, right? From family or from parents. Women are also inheriting wealth. We call it the horizontal wealth transfer. Sure. The spouse, right. Divorce or widowed out wi live the husband. Barry Ritholtz: Yes. And so it’s a way station before it goes to the kids. Jaime Magyera: Absolutely. Absolutely. And women are quite frankly, underserved in this market. Women were not seen as a, as a significant growth segment in the past. And now people are starting to come around to, wait a minute, this is a very important segment that we need to get right. And women do things differently. And so advisors need to help women do things differently and they need to serve them a little bit differently. And women, you know, like to have impact. We, we, we talk about the fact that some people invest as a means to an end. You know, women tend to invest as a means to what’s next, right? They wanna impact their community, they wanna impact their family. They’re always thinking about, what can I do with this money as opposed to, I want to make more money. And so that’s, it’s a nuance, but it’s a difference that that really requires a, a very personal relationship with a financial advisor and trust. Barry Ritholtz: You know, it’s been fascinating seeing what was previously a male dominated industry, slowly awakened to the idea that, hey, women have money Yeah. And they’re gonna continue to accrue more money. Maybe we should be more open to coming up with a way to, to serve that demographic. It, it’s like amazing, it’s taken so many decades for the industry to adjust, but it’s shockingly slow and sometimes stuck a little bit in the past. Yeah, Jaime Magyera: It is. You know, the wake up call, I think, for many is when a financial advisor has a client, maybe it’s the, the man in the household and perhaps there’s a divorce or there’s a, or the, or the client passes away, listen, 70% of women leave their financial advisor, leave their husband’s financial advisor after a divorce or a death. So 00:18:15 [Speaker Changed] Obvious with divorce, but with death, it tells you what a terrible job that advisor did. Speaking to both of those, and you know, I’ve heard stories from advisors about people kind of aghast at somebody ignoring the spouse in the room. It’s just a totally wrong, wrong approach. How does BlackRock help their advisor clients address this issue? 00:18:39 [Speaker Changed] So we believe there is such an opportunity for advice here, right there. I mean, there’s, there’s just this whole world of women who want advice. They wanna coach, they wanna partner. And so what we do is we work with financial advisors to help them better serve these clients. We do that through products. So for example, women want to be able to customize and personalize their investments to things that are, that are important to them. So we’ll talk about direct indexing, but direct indexing and what we’re doing through Aperio is a great way for an advisor to serve his client and help her have impact with what she’s doing. We also care deeply about educating advisors on this. And to your point, it’s not that the industry just woke up, is that nobody was really talking about it. And so now we’re really invested in talking about this and helping and doing events and getting advisors to bring their prospects in and we’ll join them. We are a minority investor in a company called Willow, which focuses exactly on this. It builds practice management and education and, and actually helps connect female investors to advisors. And so we’re really focused on this and it’s just such an opportunity for advice, but also an opportunity for advisors to grow their business. 00:19:50 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned Aperio. Let’s talk a little bit about direct indexing. I’m a big fan of it. We happen to have started on a different product five, six years ago, so we’ve been pretty locked in on that. Why do you believe it’s gaining so much popularity amongst both advisors and clients? 00:20:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so direct indexing, it’s, it still sounds like a new phrase to many. It’s been around for quite some time. And previously it was really used for ultra, ultra high net worth families and direct indexing an ability to create a portfolio, a custom index if you will, of securities that you can choose and select what securities you want in that portfolio to align with how you want to invest. And you can also then manage taxes more effectively in there because you can tax loss harvest. And so it’s a brilliant approach for not only aligning with your beliefs on how you invest, but also really living in an after-tax world. We need to better look at tax alpha in our investment portfolio. 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] So I’m so glad you said that. When we first started working with Shawnessy on their product, I, I was under the impression that it would first be like the most common use case would be, Hey, I don’t want tobacco or guns, or I don’t want this, whatever. I know the New York Bishop’s Archdiocese investment pool uses it to say, Hey, we don’t wanna board efficient in our portfolio or anything related to stuff that is in contradiction with our belief system. I thought that would be the biggest use. And then, hey, I work for Apple, so I don’t need all this tech. You could tune down tech in my portfolio and then taxes would bring up the rear. I had it exactly backwards in, in the past five, six years after tax returns. Tax Alpha seems to be the dominant usage for this concentrated portfolios, low basis cost, inherited stock, things like that really are a challenge to dealing with capital gains. Tell us about BlackRock’s experience with this. 00:21:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we agree completely. In fact, back in 2021, we acquired the firm aerio. And Aerio was a pioneer in direct indexing. Aperio led the market working with ultra high net worth. They called it the new institutional for the purpose of tax management after tax returns. And you think about it, we live in an after tax world. I bought my coffee with after tax dollars, yet we manage our investments before tax. And so we saw this trend coming and we could have built it, it would’ve taken us probably a lot more time, right? But we saw what Aperia was doing and their capabilities and just their approach. And we thought, man, if we could match that with our distribution reach and our scale, we could really make some wonderful, wonderful solutions for our clients. And that’s what we did. We acquired Aperio and we have a very significant direct indexing business. And to your point, Barry, it is predominantly tax customization, tax management, 00:22:51 [Speaker Changed] Right? Any e, especially when we see markets are at all time highs, people are sitting on enormous gains. Sometimes that becomes very concentrated to say nothing of people who work for tech stocks and they’ve accumulated, or other companies that have just accumulated so much value that, hey, maybe I have too much single stock risk and I wanna diversify into things. Tell us, what else does BlackRock do with direct indexing? How do you differentiate yourself for everybody these days seems to have a direct indexing product. What makes BlackRock’s special or unique? 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so you know, one of the things that we did is when we acquired Aperio, we already had a very significant separately managed account business. I mean for, for decades we had fixed income and active equity. And what we did not have was that direct indexing capability. When we brought aperio into BlackRock, we then pulled it all together and said, how can we actually make all of these capabilities together better serve our clients? So that means, for example, tax loss harvesting on Muni portfolios, right? So being able to take a capability and not just do it on on equities, but do it on fixed income. Last year we acquired a company called Spider Rock. I’m not sure if you’re familiar with Spider Rock. 00:24:04 [Speaker Changed] We’ve structured notes. Yes, we’ve used them in the past. 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And option overlays 00:24:07 [Speaker Changed] A similar kind of, not quite the same, but occasionally similar, A different solution to a similar problem. 00:24:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And to your point on concentrated stock, what a great way to hedge that concentrated stock position. If I wanna continue holding that stock, but I wanna hedge against it and manage the risk, or I wanna manage for tax implications, why not run an option overlay on top of that? And so the beauty of what we’re doing now is we’re bringing all of these discreet capabilities together into one portfolio, one holistic offering. And so you’ll be able to, we’ll be able to work with advisors and say, let’s look across your client’s entire book and let us help you build a whole portfolio of public markets, private markets, direct indexing, option overlay, all in one, really solving for unique needs, customized preferences. 00:24:54 [Speaker Changed] Really quite fascinating. So you mentioned you work with a lot of different wealth management firms. What does that relationship look like? What are these firms looking for from BlackRock? 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So I remember when I first started in the wealth business, years and years and years and years ago, you know, the relationship between asset managers and wealth management firms was often a kind of a vendor relationship. Yes. Right? It was, you have a product, let’s put it over here. Our position and our partnership with wealth management firms today is the only word I would say. It’s, it’s like true partnership, right? It’s aligned interests. We are there to not only provide them with investment capabilities, by the way, we have incredible breadth to do so, but we’re also there to help them with their technology needs, their operational and scale needs, their advisory needs. How can we help them think through how they can grow organic growth? That’s everyone’s challenge. How do I grow organically? Well, you have to scale your business and and increase your margins to do so. We help them think through all of that. And the other thing that we do is we have incredible people that are so expert in working with these firms and advisors every single day to help them achieve their goals. And our view is if, if we can help our clients, the wealth management firms and their advisors grow, we’ll naturally grow with them, right? So our job is to help them grow. 00:26:14 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk retirement. We’re recording this post Labor Day, but by the time this comes out, BlackRock’s big report, the read on retirement will be out. Tell us some of the big takeaways for this. 00:26:29 [Speaker Changed] So it’s really special for me personally because I’ve just now returned into the retirement business and have the responsibility for this retirement business. And I say it’s a responsibility and an honor because we think about the 35 million people across America that we are helping to save for retirement. Like that is, that is what we do. Over half of the assets at BlackRock, not many people know this. Over half of the assets at BlackRock are helping people save for retirement in some way. Really 00:26:58 [Speaker Changed] Over half. So when you say that it’s 4 0 1 Ks, 4 0 3 Bs, IRAs, Annie 00:27:02 [Speaker Changed] Pensions, db, wow. Yes. 00:27:05 [Speaker Changed] All of that. That’s amazing. 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] Over 50%. And that’s, I would not 00:27:07 [Speaker Changed] Have guessed 00:27:07 [Speaker Changed] That. Yeah, not many people know that. And so, you know, it’s something that we, we are so proud of and, and really for me it was always my north star. I remember when I was first in the retirement business at BlackRock, I was able to go home and tell my parents what I did and explain it to them in a way that I felt so good about and they understood and, and that’s what we get to do every day. You mentioned the survey. So it’s our 10 year anniversary of doing the survey. Wow. We’ve been doing it for a decade now. And every time we go out, we go to plan sponsors who are the employers building the plans and offering them to their employees. We go to the Savers who are the employees at massive corporations. And then we also talk to retirees, people that have saved and had access to a 401k plan, but they’re now no longer working and they’re in retirement. And so this year, I’ll break it down in this way, savers, those that are still working, the employers of these or the employees of this company, savers have the highest confidence we’ve ever seen. Hmm. Like off the charts, confidence. Now it’s come down a little bit because of market volatility. And I think what that calls out is, of course we’re all more confident when markets are, are rising, right? But very strong confidence in their ability to retire. However, we’ve seen savings come down. And so the question is, is that because of confidence, 00:28:21 [Speaker Changed] When you say savings, we mean savings rates. Savings rates, 00:28:24 [Speaker Changed] Right? Savings rates have come down. Thank you. And so the question is, is that because of confidence or is that because actually people are spending more money they need to maybe inflation maybe, right? So like we have to dig into that a little bit more. But importantly, savers are seeing more confidence or feeling more confident. You then ask the people in charge the experts who are building those plans. Confidence is very low, in fact lower than we’ve seen. Hmm. And I’ll come back to that in a moment. But I think there’s a really interesting tension there of perhaps overconfidence in savers and reality in those building the plans. And then when we move on to retirees, very low confidence once they’ve retired and their ability to actually figure out how to sustain their life in retirement. And so some of the actions or some of the insights that really came out of this one Savers are looking for access to professionally managed solutions. Think target date funds, right? LifePath portfolios. BlackRock invented the target date fund 30 years ago, but target date funds are very, very important. Two is Savers are looking for some type of clarity or solution around guaranteed income. Give me something that will just tell me what I’m going to be able to spend every month and better yet make that guaranteed. So I know I have it every month. 00:29:37 [Speaker Changed] So what does that look like? Are we talking an annuity product or something else? 00:29:41 [Speaker Changed] So imagine a target date fund with a guaranteed income sleeve in that. So we have a product called LifePath paycheck. LifePath paycheck is among a few other solutions in the marketplace, but LifePath paycheck is the fastest growing guaranteed income solution. What’s amazing about this solution though is that it, it gives employers and employees the choice to turn on that guaranteed income. So you’re investing, investing, investing, and then you come to a point and you decide, do I want that guaranteed income? Flip the switch. Flip the switch, huh. Really interesting. Really interesting. And then the third point is people, both employers and employees are saying, we need to to close the gap on this saving shortfall and we need to find more returns and more protections. And so that’s really where you start to point to private markets in target 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Date funds. So the, I think of the traditional retirement savings as classic 60 40, and what I’ve been reading about and hearing about for the past 10 plus years is, hey, 60 40 isn’t gonna get it done in the future, especially with yields as low as they’ve been up until 2022. Anyway. How do you see this side of the business changing? Is it no longer 60 40? Is it 60 30 10? Or what does this look like? Yeah, 00:30:52 [Speaker Changed] So it’s, you know, the, the one thing that’s different about the retirement space is it’s, versus the wealth space is retirement is quite slow moving. The market itself is quite slow moving. And so if you actually look back 20 years, I would say there’s probably less change over 20 years than we’ll expect to see over the next 10. Meaning people are getting very focused policy makers, employers, asset managers, record keepers on how do we close the gap between this retirement saving shortfall. And so to your question, the 60 40 worked it, it works, but actually if you were to have a 50, 30, 20, but strategically and thoughtfully make sure that that glide path, that target date fund that also incorporates private markets is doing so in a way that helps people get more diversification, gain alpha, possibly gain more income. We’ve done studies that show you can get 15% more return on a portfolio with private markets, a target date fund with private markets over a 40 year retirement. And so that’s something to talk about. 00:31:53 [Speaker Changed] Not, not, not nothing that’s pretty substantial Coming up, we continue our conversation with Jamie Majera, head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business, as well as head of BlackRock’s retirement business, discussing the rise of alternatives in the investment space at BlackRock. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My guest this week is Jamie Magera. She is the head of BlackRock’s US wealth advisory business as well as the head of their retirement business. The firm manages over $12 trillion. So let’s talk about alternatives. This has been one of the fastest growing space in in investing. Tell us what BlackRock is doing. I think a BlackRock of iShares and biggest manager of public equities and bonds in the world. What is BlackRock doing with alternatives? 00:33:03 [Speaker Changed] So if you think about the capital markets, public is only one piece of those capital markets. And for so long private markets, the other part of capital markets have been utilized for institutions or even the ultra, ultra ultra high net worth. And so there is a world to believe strongly an investment thesis that if you’re going to do the best thing for a portfolio or an investment, you need full exposure to public and to private markets. And so BlackRock is doing a lot to help advisors and their clients have easier access to private markets. So you may recall last year we had a whirlwind news announcements around H-P-S-G-I-P pre Quinn, three acquisitions all related to private markets pre Quinn related to data, GIP infrastructure, HPS, credit and private financing. And so we acquired these firms so that we could offer to our clients not just the full power of the capital markets through public but now also through private. And so we are very focused on, on really democratizing access, helping everyday people when appropriate gain access to this very important part of the capital markets. 00:34:19 [Speaker Changed] And I mentioned earlier, 60 40, you peel 10% off the 60 and 10% off the 40 and you end up with something that looks like 50, 30, 20. Is that the future of this? Because I typically, we see a lot of privates, they tend to be locked up for a long period of time. They tend to be complex to administer custodians and reporting and fees. It’s like you buy an iShare, it’s easy, you want to get involved on the private side. It just seems so much more complex for anyone less than, I don’t know, pick a number. 20 million, 10 million, right? 5 million. So what does the future of alternative investment look like at BlackRock? 00:34:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so you, you hit on it, right? I mean it was so hard for people to gain access to it. It was complicated if they were able to get access to it. And to your point, liquidity was not necessarily a top priority for various reasons. When you think about where the market is going now, there’s just been so much change over the wealth industry on how the wealth industry as a whole is starting to modernize access to private markets. And so one thing we are doing at BlackRock is we focused very much on technology partnerships that allow and and relieve the advisor of all of that operational complexity. So you think about a firm like iCapital, iCapital reviews 00:35:40 [Speaker Changed] Of which you are on the board of 00:35:41 [Speaker Changed] Correct? I am on the board and you know, iCapital has done so much to actually pave the way for advisor’s ability, wealth management firm’s ability to access private markets. But they are a technology platform. You still need the products. And to your point on drawdown and liquidity, we’ve done so much work to build solutions that actually are semi-liquid and that provide that liquidity on a regular basis for advisors and their clients. And so that’s something that has, you know, really held advisors back in the past. I think the last point, Barry, is it’s still new to so many and there’s a lot of education that’s needed. Sure. And you know, it’s education on the asset class and, and what does this really mean and how do I actually strip the 10% here and the 10% there? And so we’ve gone a step further to say, how do we make it even easier for advisors to build portfolios? Not that I have my private markets over here and my public markets over there and another account, but instead, how do I build a portfolio that’s one account and it holds public and private together in one portfolio that’s professionally managed asset allocation. All of the due diligence has been done. And so recently we’ve engaged in partnerships with firms like Geo Wealth and I Capital to be able to bring models to market, strategic asset allocated models that are professionally managed that incorporate private markets alongside of public markets. 00:37:02 [Speaker Changed] So the pushback I hear from various people about alternatives, they’re expensive, they’re liquid, you have these long lockups doing due diligence is complex and expensive. All of the back office aspects seem to be like a series of one-offs. There’s no real scalability. How are you addressing these, these issues? We 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Have found a way to scale and make it more convenient. So all of that work that you just talked about, the due diligence, the operations, the complexity, we have taken that on. We have built model portfolios that do all of that for the advisor. The advisor just has to offer that to their client. 00:37:42 [Speaker Changed] Is this in an SMA or is this how, how does this Yeah, so my firm, we, we we’re BlackRock, Vanguard, a handful of other, the bulk of our portfolios either direct indexing or, or mutual funds or ETFs, looks like that some, some clients say, what do you guys offer in terms of alternatives? And we have to click off and run a stuff. And what I’ve noticed is once you start working into the, here’s the cost and here’s the lockup and here’s what the reporting looks like and it’s held at a custodian here, the complexity tends to be like, is this really worth it? Well, theoretically it provides diversification and historically there have been some cases of, of outperformance all that comes off the advisor’s plate and you guys handle all of 00:38:29 [Speaker Changed] It. So if an advisor wanted to build a portfolio for you, you’re the client, the advisor could call BlackRock could say, I wanna build a custom portfolio, I want it to have this component of public markets. Maybe it’s iShares ETFs, maybe it’s direct indexing aperio. I would like it to have this component of private markets. Perhaps it’s BlackRock credit, BlackRock equity on the private side. We will customize that for them and then it’s waiting for them on a platform like Geo Wealth, which is a, you know, geo wealth, well a technology platform that will automatically rebalance it for them and that advisor can now then invest their clients in that portfolio. 00:39:04 [Speaker Changed] How about if a firm comes up to you and says, Hey, we’re pretty good on the stocks and bonds side. We really need help on the alt side and we have such embedded long-term gains that it’s painful to, to peel too much off, but going forward we wanna build this into what we offer and add this to existing clients. What does that solution look like? Call 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] BlackRock. We have a team of, you asked about CFAs earlier, we have a team of CFAs portfolio consultants, tax economists who do nothing but work with advisors every day on solving those problems. They will work, they will consult, they’ll help them take the portfolio they have. We want to meet the advisors where they are, right? So we want to help them build on what they have and we’ll work with them to take that portfolio and transition it into whatever the destination is they’re going for. We’ll work with them in a way to do IT tax efficiently and at the appropriate cadence for their client. 00:40:00 [Speaker Changed] And you guys very successfully took crypto and Bitcoin and put it into an ETF. Are we ever gonna get to a point where Alts become an ETF product? 00:40:10 [Speaker Changed] Look, I think there is a world where so much can happen, right? In the next five years. I think we’re going to see a lot of things around private markets. Part of that is solving for data and having the transparency around the private markets. What is an ETF? Right? It’s transparency into that index. Part of our thought process in acquiring precan was being able to offer data transparency around private markets. But I also think that sometimes people naturally go to ETF as kind of shorthand for liquidity, convenient and low cost. And I think there’s a lot of ways that we have to figure out as an industry and BlackRock’s working on this right now, how do you structure and build vehicles that allow for liquidity, allow for lower cost and allow for easier access, less complexity around private markets. Maybe it’s an ETF, maybe it’s something else. Yeah, 00:41:00 [Speaker Changed] Liquidity is always the challenge. When you have an investment product that by design is supposed to play out over 5, 7, 8 years, they’re not public for a reason. They need the breadth for whatever that market cycle is to, to realize those gains. So I get the challenge. What are you doing to educate advisors and clients about what this process looks like? 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] I’m glad you asked that because I keep coming back to liquidity is a challenge when it does not match an expectation of a client. And so advisors need to fully understand what they’re working with when they delve into private markets. And in some cases it is a five to seven year lockup if they’re doing draw downs. In some cases you do have a liquidity interval every quarter. And so we are working with advisors all across the industry to help educate them on the new type of private markets, the new vehicles, the semi-liquid structures, but then more so we’re working with them to help them understand how do you actually put that in a whole portfolio? Talk to me about how private markets sits alongside of public markets and what that does for the risk profile, for the return profile and for the liquidity profile. 00:42:13 [Speaker Changed] And, and BlackRock launched a model, I wanna say earlier this year that uses both private and public assets under one ticker. That sounds like really challenging to put together. Tell us a little bit about that. 00:42:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it was challenging, very challenging. And it was something that we could not do alone for all of the reasons you, you mentioned it took operations and technology platforms like iCapital, it took operations and, and rebalancing and trade platforms like geo wealth to be able to allow us to deliver this portfolio. So this was something that we announced earlier this year alongside of Geo wealth and iCapital. And it was the first of its kind in the industry, a model portfolio that in one model, in one account you can have public and private automatic rebalancing customized for your client done so easily. So conveniently, 00:43:07 [Speaker Changed] Some of what you’re describing sounds a little bit like O CIOs that kind of were the rage a few years ago. Outsource CIOs where a professional manager can bring a higher level of professional wealth management to a smaller shop. TE tell us, is this similar to that or, or what are the parallels? 00:43:27 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s, it’s a, it is one of the most accelerated trend we are seeing in the wealth market right now, which is this whole notion of outsourcing and whether an advisor is doing it because they want to professionalize what they’re offering to their client or whether an advisor is choosing to outsource because they want to save time and their value is being with the client and talking about the holistic wealth plan, not the investment management component of it. And so they turn to BlackRock to be the outsourced provider. And so we have a models business, which is effectively an OCIO business. A A models business for the wealth channel is 350 billion today. It’s grown rapidly over the past few years. We think that’ll double in the next few years. And it’s because advisors are turning to us to say, please let us outsource to you. And it’s not just advisors, wealth managers are doing the same because again, wealth managers are going to focus on their core value, which is serving their clients, helping their clients build financial plans and helping them navigate their wealth picture holistically. They turn to BlackRock to help them, them scale their investment management. And that’s where our outsourcing capabilities come in. 00:44:35 [Speaker Changed] So we’ve talked about wealth management, we’ve talked about iShares and as well as alpha pursuit and retirement planning. My last question for you is, what do you think advisors, clients, investors are not thinking about but perhaps should be? What, what important topics? It could be an asset, it could be a geography, it could be a policy or data point. What do you think is getting overlooked but just shouldn’t? 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] I think taxes is still not being discussed enough. Taxes as a concept. I mean there is so much value you can bring as an advisor to your client by just having that conversation, asking the question. So I would encourage everyone to do that. That is such a way to build loyalty, trust, and deepen relationship. And by the way, your client starts to tell you where they have assets elsewhere. The other area I would say is just really thinking about the future growth drivers of, of our economy. So infrastructure, ai, we didn’t talk about ai, but the, the the, 00:45:32 [Speaker Changed] It’s gonna be another thing. Another 00:45:33 [Speaker Changed] Thing that might turn into something. 00:45:35 [Speaker Changed] Right, right. Gonna be big one day. Exactly. 00:45:36 [Speaker Changed] But I, you know, you think about some of these future growth drivers infrastructure as part of, you know, why we acquired GIP, but we have iShare solutions that really align with infrastructure as well. And I just think that’s such a under discussed opportunity. Huh, 00:45:51 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Alright, I only have you for a few more minutes. So let’s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all our guests. Starting with tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:46:02 [Speaker Changed] Oh, so this is such a good question and hard question. I will answer it this way. There are so many, I love to have a board of directors approach. Like I have this whole crew of people that I go to for different things and I, I truly like, you know, you mentioned Lene Ramey, he’s one of them. Martin Small, Rob Goldstein, Rob Capto, mark Weidman. Like there’s so many Anne Ackerley who used to run the retirement business at BlackRock and they’ve all played a different role in my career and in my life. 00:46:30 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Let’s talk books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 00:46:36 [Speaker Changed] Lama Llama Red Pajama 00:46:39 [Speaker Changed] To your Kids at Night? Is that what that is? I 00:46:41 [Speaker Changed] Have a 4-year-old. He loves Lama Llama. So any Lama llama you can imagine. But actually I just finished a great book for the second time. A more beautiful question, huh? Warren Berger. It talks about the art of inquiry and using inquiry to, I mean, gosh, the heart of any innovation, why does the world not have this? What if the world did have this? How do we get the world to have this? And so it really talks about the art of inquiry as a way to better understand, to fuel curiosity and to innovate and create better solutions. 00:47:15 [Speaker Changed] I love that name. I’m gonna have to check that out. Let’s talk streaming. What are you watching or listening to these days? Oh gosh. Netflix, Amazon podcasts. Tell us what’s keeping you entertained? 00:47:25 [Speaker Changed] So I have this, this barbell approach. I, I go, I love reality tv. Oh really? Below Deck. Do you watch Below Deck? 00:47:32 [Speaker Changed] No, but I know plenty of people who 00:47:34 [Speaker Changed] Do. Oh so good. But that’s kind of one side of it. The other side of it is I like Intensity. So like Mayor of Kingstown, I’m watching Terminal List Dark Wolf right now. I think that’s on Amazon. It is very good. Basically Chris Pratt, is it? Yes. Navy Seal, term C, A operative. 00:47:53 [Speaker Changed] Very, very good. Very interesting, right? Yeah. Yeah. We just finished Killing Eve. 00:47:58 [Speaker Changed] Oh, I haven’t started yet, which was 00:48:00 [Speaker Changed] My wife watched it, loved it, and said you have to watch this. And she rewatched it with me, if you like that sort of high intensity espionage. Really great cast. Great. Really strong recommend. So our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in retirement services, wealth management, investing? How would you advise them? 00:48:26 [Speaker Changed] So I go back to my way, my entry into this industry. I didn’t know the first thing about anything. I didn’t think I wanted to be in this industry, but I went in with open eyes and I asked a lot of questions. And in some ways it was like because I didn’t have the experience, it made it easier for me to be just like an everyday person that we were trying to serve. And so I say, come into this industry, you don’t need a traditional background. In fact, I prefer people not to have a traditional background of finance or econ come into this industry and help us make it better. 00:48:55 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Love that. And our final question, what do you know about the world of wealth management? Retirement services investing today would’ve been useful 25 years or so ago when you were first getting started? 00:49:08 [Speaker Changed] I was really fortunate to have my father tell me that the first thing I needed to do when I got a job was start saving in an IRA and in my 401k. And even when it hurt to do, I did it. I wish I had known back then that I could have been saving in many different ways. I could have been investing in many different ways, right? And so, you know, to anyone who’s out there thinking about are they saving enough or investing enough, the answer is probably no. And you should do more. And there’s so many ways to do it. You can use a financial advisor, you can go direct, you can do it in many different ways, but just do it. Just start. That’s something I would’ve done. Huh. 00:49:42 [Speaker Changed] Really, really good advice. Thank you, Jamie, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Jamie Majera.

Share this article Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $76 million in outflows on Monday, with major asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity among the firms reporting investor redemptions from their exchange-traded funds. The outflows continue a pattern of volatility seen in September 2025, with ETH-tracking funds experiencing fluctuating investor interest. Fidelity and Bitwise drove much of the redemption activity, while BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF saw occasional inflows that partially offset the broader trend across the product category. Since launching in July 2024, spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated over $13 billion in net inflows overall. However, Grayscale’s legacy trust has seen outflows exceeding $4.5 billion as investors migrated to newer, lower-fee alternatives. The funds have shown institutional appetite for ETH exposure in recent months, with several trading days recording more than $100 million in inflows. Ethereum traded at approximately current levels amid broader digital asset market movements. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Anthony Scaramucci, strategic advisor of AgriFORCE Growing Systems Ltd. AGRI, sounded optimistic on Avalanche AVAX/USD on Monday, deeming it as the “Swiss army knife” among Layer-1 networks. AGRI stock is racing ahead of the pack. See if it is worth your attention here. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who will serve as the company’s strategic advisor, said that they made a “big bet” on Avalanche due to its tokenization potential. “Lots of big corporate CTOs are picking up Avalanche as part of their story to tokenize their funds or potentially even tokenize their assets,” he said. Scaramucci also highlighted the importance of subnets, interoperable networks within Avalanche’s ecosystem that can be tailored to specific use cases. “I often say that Avalanche is like a Swiss army knife of Layer-1 networks, so it’s got a lot of flexibility,” he added. See Also: Crypto Isn’t The Real Threat – It’s Regulatory Chaos The rebranding and capital raise strategy comes in the wake of growing interest in the Avalanche network. Scaramucci endorsed the Layer-1 network last month, stating that its "moment is coming.” He said last year that AVAX, often dubbed an Ethereum ETH/USD-killer, is part of his cryptocurrency portfolio and among the "high-quality, great core assets” in the long term. Avalanche, which launched in 2020, seeks to provide scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Notably, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, expanded its use to the Avalanche blockchain. Price Action: At the time of writing, AVAX was trading up 4.78% to $33.29, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The coin has surged 27% over the last month. AgriFORCE shares slipped 7.08% in after-hours trading after closing 134.44% higher at $5.650 during Monday’s regular trading session. The stock lagged on the Momentum and Growth parameters as of this writing. Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to compare it with leading cryptocurrency treasury firms, such as Strategy Inc.

Title: Market Analyst Alleges XRP Price Is Being Deliberately Suppressed, Who Are The Culprits?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-deliberately-suppressed/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T02:00:47Z
Full Content:
A new debate is emerging in the crypto world after a video shared by Versan Aljarrah, the founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted bold claims from about the XRP price financial expert Dr. Jim Willie. In the video, Willie claims that the current XRP price is not natural and powerful players are artificially holding it down. According to Willie, the goal of this move is to acquire more XRP at low prices due to its expected role in the future of global finance. Dr. Jim Willie explains that large banks and financial institutions are not letting the XRP price rise in value at this stage. He says this is not by accident but by design. In his words, what appears to be a flat market is, in reality, a stall created by influential players. According to Willie, these institutions believe XRP will be a key part of the financial system in the future. That is why they are working to build their holdings while the asset remains cheap. Instead of letting the market decide its fair price, they are making sure the cost stays low long enough for them to collect more. Willie goes further by naming some of the groups he believes are involved. He points to BlackRock as one of the major players working to keep XRP under pressure. He even calls BlackRock “a disgustingly corrupt private equity firm” instead of a bank, making clear how negative his view of them is. Willie also says big players may ask Ripple to go along with this plan. He claims the big players are asking Ripple to help keep XRP under $3 so they can buy massive amounts. According to him, they do not want to buy XRP at $7 or $8, which is where he believes the market already values the asset. Instead, they want Ripple’s help to hold it down, giving them time to buy what he calls “a boatload” of tokens at bargain prices. These statements, shared by Aljarrah, suggest that the current market price of XRP may not be a natural one. If Willie’s claims are valid, then what people see is not simply a matter of supply and demand but a coordinated effort by strong financial groups to control the XRP price and reap the most significant benefits. Many traders and investors have long worried that digital assets do not move freely, but rather, powerful hands behind the scenes actively shape them. Within the digital asset ecosystem, where trust and transparency are already constant issues, such claims strike at the heart of ongoing debates about whether ordinary investors are getting a fair market or one designed to benefit only the most prominent institutions.

Skip to comments. Posted on 09/22/2025 12:50:06 PM PDT by whyilovetexas111 Baltic incidents—drones, airspace brushes, GNSS spoofing—could cascade into a NATO–Russia war driven by fear, honor, and interest. Opening phases likely favor NATO in air and sea with superior ISR, EW, and standoff fires; Russia counters with missiles, dense air defenses, cyber, and navigation attacks. Two plausible endgames emerge: a non-nuclear grind to an armistice shaped by attrition and political risk, or limited nuclear use to coerce termination, shattering the taboo and accelerating crisis instability.

Nobody wins, everybody loses, especially the U.S. taxpayer! Blackrock and the Finks of the world win. They get to rape taxpayers for weapons contracts, then get the re-construction contracts, and then get dibs on resources. Ivan, you’re in our airspace! Turn 180 and fly east to exit! No one can predict military outcomes, maybe that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. It says NATO would just want to preserve alliance territory. And Russia would just want an aftermath where it has more influence over Europe. Hogwash. Russia would seek to hold as much of Eastern and Western Europe as possible. NATO would need to stop the Russian invasion by defeating the Russian army. Would it lead to nuclear exchanges? Depends. If Russia wants to go scorched earth they will use nukes at the outset or as soon as they suffer setbacks. Most likely both sides would try to keep it conventional, in which case Russia would seize some easy territory and then be defeated by the US and NATO. They are no match for our air force for starters. They can’t move on the ground like us, and right now they are tied down in Ukraine. Their navy? Please. If this is part of a coordinated attack with China, all bets are off and it’s balls to the walls on all fronts. That’s why we need to deter this stuff through strength. Russia has all they can handle fighting Ukraine. If the war spreads, Russia will fragment. On 24 November 2015, a Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M attack aircraft near the Syria–Turkey border. According to Turkey, the aircraft was fired upon while in Turkish airspace because it violated the border up to a depth of 2.19 kilometres (1.36 miles) for about 17 seconds after being warned to change its heading ten times over a period of five minutes before entering the airspace Get the US out of NATO. This isn’t our battle. It’s Europe’s. I’m sick and tired of wasting my taxpayer dollars on proxy wars with Russia. “...that’s why I found the article to be ridiculous. The editor in chief of the NSJ has been published in the NY Times and CNN. Not to be trusted with anything. wy69 China. The rump UK empire/EU-Davos are collapsing Their last desperate act will be to start war, especially involving the United States. We'll See. I think Putun is stress-testing the alliance. He suspects Germans will not die to defend Estonians. He suspects Trump will be disappointed but unwilling to defend them. And re-absorbing the Baltics rights what he considers a historic wrong since he considers the Baltics to be historically Russian. And, he can say he is defending the rights of Russian speakers there. Weakness invites him to roll the dice. The MIC Why should the US sacrifice everything for the MUSLIM CALIPHATE of Western Europe? Let’s be honest: Western Europe has fallen to Islam and the WEF (WEF supports sharia). Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are standing strong against the Sharia-friendly EUSSR, but the US cannot afford to pay for another stupid war, nor do Americans want our troops dying in vain. Of course, if it goes nuclear, none of this matters. And, I really don’t want to witness a nuclear holocaust for Ukraine. We keep hearing this Boomer braggadocio about mighty NATO. Meanwhile, the West is still failing on the basics like artillery ammunition production. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZcZrPWlZbQ it won’t happen I think this is what we are seeing. a series of events, possible false flags, hyped into a justification for more overt involvement against russia, then a cry of article 5 when things happen. some of the pictures from poland of the drones make little credible sense. drones clearly photo-staged in places they didn’t land, duct tape on them, etc. Europe in general does not want this to stop, and they will force trumps hand on it. they are doing so now. If Russia can’t defeat Ukraine and has most of its army bogged down there, how the hell would it then take on all the members of NATO including the United States? Has nothing to do with braggadocia. With the commitment of all the Western air forces including the US? With the US Navy battle groups committed? With the US and Europe on a war footing? Russia can’t defeat Ukraine, it made a mess of that campaign, with what additional army would it take on all the countries of NATO? why do you think Russia constantly threatened nuclear war (sort of) if NATO became involved? Why do you think Russia has tolerated direct attacks on its forces and facilities inside Russia? In addition to being an idiot, Putin knows Russia cannot take On NATO. He might try to grab the Baltics if he thinks NATO will back down rather than fight him. Whatever. Show me any recent analysis that has Russia defeating NATO in a conventional war. That’s what the article was addressing, wasn’t it? Trump is not weakness. And we are preparing for Putin to invade the Baltics.

Title: Adani Group Plans Leverage Cut, Sees No Dollar Bond Until 2027
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/adani-group-plans-leverage-cut-sees-no-dollar-bond-until-2027
Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:32:05Z
Full Content:
Indian conglomerate Adani Group aims to cut its leverage over the next five years and has no plans to issue bonds in international capital markets until 2027. The group’s next foreign currency bond sale will likely be a dollar bond, said group Chief Financial Officer Jugeshinder Singh. Issuances in the domestic market as well as Reg D issuances, where borrowers can sell securities without having to register them with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, will continue. The billionaire Gautam Adani-led group, which is among the largest Indian issuers of dollar bonds, will work to pare its leverage until 2030, Singh said, speaking in an interview in London. The measures would reinforce an effort by Adani to introduce more financial discipline to its balance sheet after bond spreads widened in the wake of a short-seller report in 2023 and an investigation into an alleged bribery scheme by the US Department of Justice the following year, which the group has denied. India’s securities market regulator on Thursday cleared the group’s founder of some allegations raised by the short-seller. Singh said Adani “aims to reduce the leverage level of portfolio companies to a level similar to established utilities in OECD member countries than emerging markets levels.” Adani is cutting leverage because it has become “counterproductive” to hold too much cash on its balance sheet, especially after positive rating actions. Even though the group’s net debt has risen in recent years, a faster level of earnings growth has driven down leverage from a peak in the 2022 fiscal year. Net debt was about 2.37 trillion rupees ($26.9 billion) for the 2025 fiscal year, while the net debt to EBITDA ratio, a measure of leverage, was 2.63 times, according to a credit update note published by the conglomerate in August. That’s down from 3.81 times three years prior. Earlier this year, the ports unit began buying back some of its outstanding debt. Still, Adani will have to balance its effort to cut leverage with ambitious capital spending plans and a recent spate of private debt deals from lenders including Apollo Global Management Inc., Metlife Inc., and BlackRock Inc. At the annual meeting of the flagship company earlier this year, founder Gautam Adani touted plans to spend between $15 and $20 billion annually over the next five years. In November, Adani said in a post on X that the group would invest $10 billion in US energy security and infrastructure projects. Singh said the group doesn’t need to borrow the finance the $10 billion investment plans in the U.S. as the expenditure is within the group’s ‘cash envelope,’ referring to cash generated by companies, and it represents a small portion of the group’s broader spending plans over the next five to six years.

Title: Hightower Hires Former BlackRock Executive to Help Scale Operations
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/ria-news/hightower-hires-former-blackrock-exec-to-help-scale-operations
Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:08:31Z

The move comes as new Hightower CEO Larry Restieri starts putting his stamp on the firm after years of rampant acquisition. September 22, 2025 Hightower Advisors, the Chicago-based mega-RIA with $326 billion in client assets, has hired a former BlackRock executive as head of operations and services amid a push to boost connectivity between advisors and the home office. Patrick Dunne has joined Hightower as a managing director and head of operations and service. According to his LinkedIn, Dunne’s most recent role has been as founder and lead of BlueGranite, an investor working to “scale” fintech and investment firms. Earlier in his career, he held various leadership roles at BlackRock, including head of iShares global markets and investments. “We are pleased to welcome Patrick Dunne to Hightower,” a spokesperson said via email. “His experience scaling complex organizations will help accelerate our ongoing investment in operational excellence—making it easier for advisors to serve clients.” According to filings, Dunne will join with an equity stake in Hightower, which is majority owned by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners. In separate news, Charis Jones, Hightower's executive director of compliance, has left the firm for a new position that, according to a LinkedIn post, she will announce soon. Hightower did not respond to a request for comment on whether they are replacing the role. Related:TradePMR Offers 0.5% Asset Match on New Deposits for RIA Clients Changes at the mega-RIA come as new CEO Larry Restieri begins to make his mark on the firm. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs’ Ayco business was named the new head in February to take over from Bob Oros, who remains on the firm’s board. His official start was in June. Restieri hired State Street alum Randy Bullard in one of his early moves to lead a new centralized investment management platform. The platform is designed to provide Hightower’s roughly 660 advisors with institutional research and investment counsel from the recent Hightower acquisition of NEPC, an institutional consulting firm and outsourced chief investment officer. “We expect our advisors will choose to adopt the centralized investments platform because of its compelling features, products, and the improved client experience that it will offer our practices; importantly, though, it will be the advisors’ choice to adopt the central platform, not a requirement,” a spokesperson said. “It’s just one of the ways Larry envisions delivering enhancements for advisors.” The RIA has more “advancements for advisors” in the coming months, the spokesperson said. In the meantime, Restieri is working to create more collaboration between advisors and the home office. He has been speaking with Hightower advisors about creating “regional support to help advisory practices collaborate and work more closely together with each other and with home office specialists,” according to a spokesperson. “This regional approach does not represent a consolidation strategy but is a way to better engage and support our practices.” Related:Pennsylvania-Based Institutional and Wealth Firms Combine to Form $9B Shop Citywire had previously reported that Hightower was pursuing a regional consolidation strategy, citing sources. Restieri takes over after Oros led years of acquisitions for Hightower. Oros joined in 2019, replacing founder Elliot Weissbluth, who built Hightower primarily from wirehouse breakaway advisors. Under Oros, the firm shifted to acquiring RIAs with private equity funding. During his tenure, the firm made over 50 acquisitions.

Title: Exclusive: The CEO Who Wants to Make Her Bank the U.S. Gateway to Central Asia

Time Published: 2025-09-22T13:22:03Z

Washington, D.C. –When Umut Abakirova graduated from the American University of Central Asia, she began her career as a loan officer. Two decades later, she is one of Central Asia’s most prominent women in finance: chief executive of Bakai Bank, one of the Kyrgyz Republic’s largest private lenders. Her ambition is to turn Bakai into a gateway between Central Asia and the West, a partner for American companies and investors seeking exposure to an overlooked but resource-rich region. In an interview with Breitbart News, Abakirova made her case for why Washington should pay attention. “We came here to represent our country, a little but very strong country, I would say, Kyrgyzstan,” she said. “We are growing very fast. And we are ready to be transparent and open for international cooperation.” Bakai has expanded rapidly. It serves more than a million clients, doubled its loan portfolio in the past two years, and counts Coca-Cola, KFC, Hyatt Regency, and General Electric among its corporate customers. In 2025 it became an official partner of UFC CIS, boosting its brand visibility far beyond finance. A Fitch Ratings report in June assigned Bakai a “B-” rating with a stable outlook, praising its profitability, deposit growth, and adequate capital buffers. The bank’s loan book grew at a 38 percent annual pace from 2022 through 2024, while deposits surged 64 percent. Abakirova described a problem little discussed outside the region: remittances from Kyrgyz workers in Russia, who make up roughly one-third of the country’s labor force. Western sanctions on Moscow have made official transfers nearly impossible. “Now this money is coming to our country by cash, or by crypto, or by Chinese yuan,” she said. “Honestly, we don’t like this growing influence of China.” She warned that sanctions are unintentionally strengthening Beijing’s hand in Central Asia. “We are afraid of secondary sanctions,” Abakirova said. “But we need some assurance from the government of USA or OFAC to make these transfers officially.” OFAC is the common abbreviation for the Office of Foreign Assets Control. It’s an office of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, regimes, groups, and individuals. The request, never before aired publicly, points to the delicate position of a small state wedged between Russia and China but seeking Western ties. The dependency runs deeper than remittances. “We have no choice besides buying gas from Russia,” she said, explaining how sanctions policies are inadvertently pushing her country toward alternatives Washington would prefer to avoid. “That’s why we have come here.” Despite its international outreach—audited by KPMG, deploying U.S.-made LexisNexis compliance systems, and publishing its first ESG report—Bakai still faces a basic barrier: no American bank has correspondent accounts in the Kyrgyz Republic, or even in Central Asia. “That is also a problem for our region,” Abakirova said. “We are very transparent. But we need those relationships to connect.” Her push is to persuade U.S. banks and regulators that Bakai is a credible counterparty—highlighting the bank’s Big Four audits, membership in Washington-based trade finance associations, and its designation as a systemically important bank at home. Kyrgyzstan’s Abakirova sits down for a face-to-face Interview with John Carney (Breitbart News) Kyrgyz itself has been expanding at a brisk clip, with 9 percent GDP growth annually from 2022 through 2024, the highest in Central Asia. The government is building more renewable energy capacity, expanding railways, and tapping deposits of gold, lithium, and rare earths critical to global supply chains. “We are more open. We are more democratic, in comparison with other countries, and we are more open for international institutions,” Abakirova said. Her pitch is that the country offers both strategic resources and political openness, making it a natural partner for the U.S. “We want to be a gateway to Central Asia for America,” Abakirova said, saying this could make the region less dependent on Russia and China. Abakirova’s personal trajectory mirrors her country’s ambitions. She rose from entry-level loan officer to CEO of Bakai after the bank acquired her employer. Now she oversees an institution with an 11 percent share of sector assets and a 12 percent share of deposits, growing fast but still looking for outside partners. Her meetings in Washington this summer with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and executives from BlackRock and Bank of America were a first step. Whether her calls for U.S. engagement are answered may determine if Bakai remains a domestic success—or becomes Central Asia’s bridge to the global financial system.

Title: The Great TikTok Sell-Off: Implications For US Consumers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/anjanasusarla/2025/09/22/the-great-tiktok-sell-off-implications-for-us-consumers/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T12:21:41Z
Full Content:
ByAnjana Susarla, Contributor. Talks are ongoing between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a potential TikTok deal. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that TikTok engineers will re-create a set of content-recommendation algorithms for the app in the US, using technology licensed from TikTok’s parent ByteDance. Such an arrangement could assuage concerns about national security. On April 24, 2024, the U.S. enacted the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which requires TikTok to be sold by its parent company, ByteDance, to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. The Supreme Court upheld the law in January 2025. Users on digital platforms face an overabundance of viewing choices. Unlike in the past where a consumer had to drive to a physical store and spend time browsing the limited inventory, now we have seemingly endless choices. Recommendation algorithms on various platforms, be it Netflix, TikTok, or YouTube — control how we navigate the choices made available by on-demand streaming media, since there is too much content for any one user to filter through. The digital overabundance of choices increases our dependence on algorithmic filters to curate and sort our entertainment preferences. This is where TikTok has an edge over its competitors. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm is hyper-personalized. The platform tracks incredibly detailed engagement patterns, such as video interactions (like, share, how long you watch a video), scrolling behavior (speed and pattern of navigation), your search history, the time spent on the app and your content creation patterns. TikTok also gathers very detailed location information, ranging from browsing habits and GPS location to interactions within apps, including precise GPS coordinates (if enabled), location inferred from IP address and time zone information. All this information is analyzed to personalize a "For You" page, predict what content consumers engage with, target advertisements and to identify trending content and creators. The sheer volume and granularity of this data collection allows TikTok to build incredibly detailed user profiles, enabling their highly addictive recommendation algorithm while raising significant privacy concerns about how this information is stored, processed, and potentially shared. A new ownership structure could allow American supervision of the algorithm. Traditional e-commerce platforms are goal oriented and assume customers know what they want and come to shop with a specific purpose. E-commerce platforms such as Amazon implicitly assume that users have a clear purchase intent, and success is measured by quickly users can find and buy what they need. TikTok on the other hand enables product discovery while users are watching entertaining videos, often impulse-buying items they weren’t searching for. The TikTok model treats shopping as entertainment and focuses on helping users discover things they didn't know they wanted. The platform suggests items based on trends, lifestyle, or visual appeal, where shopping becomes a leisure activity, not just a transaction. Products are discovered through influencer content, user reviews, and social features. This shift reflects changing consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics who prefer discovery and entertainment over traditional product research. It also allows platforms to introduce users to a much broader range of products than what consumers might have searched for on their own. Indeed, it is estimated that TikTok users in the U.S. have spent close to $41.3 million in the app to date, or about 55 percent of the global total, placing the US first in terms of user revenue for the app. Most users of digital platforms are completely in the dark about the extent to which platforms monetize user interactions, and in turn, how nudges and recommendations from platforms impact aggregate behavior. Social media companies primarily monetize through advertising, which relies heavily on user data to target ads effectively. Users’ personal information, behavioral patterns, and social connections are essentially the product being sold to advertisers. When users lack control over their data, they can’t make informed decisions about their digital footprint or protect sensitive information from being used in ways they didn’t anticipate. Such concentrated data ownership gives platforms significant influence over information flow, user behavior, and even democratic processes, as seen in lawmakers concerns about election interference and misinformation. Most major platforms now offer some data control options, largely due to regulations like Europe’s GDPR and California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), that allow for data portability, deletion rights, and enhanced privacy settings. Under such regulations, companies are also required to publish transparency reports disclosing what data they collect and how it’s used, though these are often lengthy and technical. Despite these controls, true data ownership remains elusive because terms of service often grant platforms broad rights to use consumer data. Data deletion doesn’t necessarily remove copies used for analytics or shared with third parties. The complexity of modern data processing makes it difficult to track all uses. The key requirement from US legislation is that ByteDance must divest its control, but the specific ownership structure of the replacement entity remains flexible. It is worth noting that ByteDance’s ownership is already diversified, with 60% owned by global institutional investors such as BlackRock, General Atlantic, and Susquehanna International Group. As AI-powered search becomes more sophisticated, it could pull users away from TikTok’s discovery-driven model. While the younger generation prefers TikTok to typing queries on Google, AI assistants could reclaim this behavior by providing more personalized, conversational answers. AI also threatens TikTok's creator economy by potentially flooding the platform with synthetic content. TikTok’s core strength is its recommendation algorithm, but AI advancements could level this playing field through better personalization and cross-platform AI. New AI models can analyze user behavior across multiple platforms for superior targeting. AI could also enable entirely new types of social platforms and social interaction, such as the ability to personalize content to end users rather than just recommending existing content. Another way that AI could shape digital platforms is through enabling synthetic social experiences wherein virtual influencers and AI companions that provide entertainment without human creators. Finally, an era of integrated AI assistants could emerge where social media, search, and AI assistance converge into one experience. While the final details of the TikTok deal are being ironed out, it is worth pointing out that AI could erode TikTok’s key strengths in content creation and personalization. Here, again, though, TikTok could also have an edge in that its AI models are equipped with detailed behavioral data gathered from its users. Data could yet be the new currency in the new AI-enabled landscape.

Title: Clothes waste: How to be part of the solution, not the problem

Buy second-hand. And we are not just talking about rummaging through your local charity shop hoping to find the bargain of the century – although we are not knocking that either. In the world in which we live we have sites such as Vinted, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, eBay and many, many more. By shopping second hand – or vintage if you’d rather – you will be able to rejoice in the fact that you are very on-trend. US fashion resale was worth $15.6 billion in 2015 and is now worth $55.3 billion. Vinted is the number one retailer in France by sales volume. And we all know the French know a thing or two about style. If just 10 per cent of Irish consumers shifted a decent chunk of their spending to second-hand retailers, not only would they get some cool bargains, they would be sending a signal to fast fashion that change is necessary. If you are buying, try and buy from small, local businesses where possible. And there are many of them: Fresh Cuts in Dublin city centre; Slowstreet in Blackrock, Co Dublin; Ohh! By Gum in Clifden; Pure Clothing in Ballina; and YAWUW (you are what you wear) in Cork. If you are going to a swanky wedding or a ball in a castle or some such, rather than spending an absolute fortune on a frock you’ll wear once, why not consider renting one from the likes of Drobey, HappyDaysRental or The 105? And when you are shopping, try – in so far as it is possible – to prioritise quality over quantity and natural fibres (organic cotton, certified wool, linen) over synthetic (polyester, acrylic). When you are in shops or shopping online, look for sustainable fabric certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OCS (Organic Content Standard), RWS (Responsible Wool Standard), and RCS (Recycled Claim Standard). It is not going to solve the problem but it might go some way to not making it worse. [ Use your clothes for nine months more and reduce their environmental footprint by up to 30%Opens in new window ] It is hard to do any serious research while standing on a shop floor with a pair of jeans in your hand, so do some before you shop using resources like Good On You. It is most illuminating and easy to use. And finally, borrow from second World War Britain and make do and mend. Repairing a hole in a wool jumper saves more than 16kg of CO2e, which is the equivalent of leaving a lightbulb on for 50 days. You get to hang on to a jumper you might love, and it is just a matter of saying ‘darn it’.

Title: Sudden $200 Billion Crypto Sell-Off Sparks Fresh Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 09/22 update below. This post was originally published on September 20 Bitcoin and crypto have exploded back this year, largely thanks to BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (though fears have emerged of a bitcoin price “death spiral”). Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price topped $124,000 per bitcoin last month, though its early 2025 rally has stalled in recent months, just as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issued a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sachs quietly admits to growing fears over the U.S. dollar, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved a major rule change that could mean the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) “floodgates” open. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run This week, the SEC voted in favor of proposed rule changes by three national securities exchanges, allowing them to adopt generic listing standards for new crypto ETFs. 09/22 update: The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dropping around 3% in mere minutes and plunging under $112,000 per bitcoin from a peak of almost $118,000 just last week. "Bitcoin broke through support near $115,000, which bears had been tryingto push through since 13 September," Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro’s chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “In recent days, there have been several signals of a shift to a downward trend in the first cryptocurrency. BTCUSD fell out of the upward channel that had been in place since early September, dropped below horizontal support and fell sharply below the 50-day moving average. This combination of negative signals suggests a further decline is likely unless there is a fundamental change in financial market sentiment.” Bitcoin’s sudden price dive has hit the wider crypto market, wiping $200 billion from the combined market since Friday. “Bitcoin is currently entering a correction phase,” Linh Tran, a market analyst with XS.com, said in emailed comments. “This pause is seen as necessary to absorb profit-taking pressure, reduce short-term leverage, and lay the groundwork for a more stable price base.” Last week, the Federal Reserve met expectations when it cut interest rates by 25 basis points, with a reduction of interest rates generally seen to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin and crypto—though a a nightmare scenario could send bitcoin into a “death spiral." “This signaled the end of the tightening cycle, but Fed chair Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks that future policy would remain data-dependent tempered market expectations for the pace of easing," said Tran. "This explains why bitcoin stalled, even though a lower interest rate environment typically benefits risk assets.” The bitcoin price correction was expected following last week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, according to some analysts. “While the FOMC meeting sparked optimism for a Q4 breakout, bitcoin was more likely to enter a 1-2 week consolidation phase immediately afterward," Markus Thielen, the chief executive of 10x Research, said via email, pointing to a rise in leveraged longs that are increasingly vulnerable as liquidity thinned and raising the risk of a downside break. “On-chain metrics provide further evidence that market activity is once again fading,” Thielen added. "The real question: how long can this consolidation drag on?” The SEC approval "will open up the floodgates," Steve Feinour, a partner at Stradley Ronon, told Reuters. “The big trigger this week was the SEC’s approval of generic listing standards for crypto ETFs on the likes of NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe,” Nic Puckrin, macroeconomics analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “Until now, every ETF had to go through a lengthy, case-by-case process. Now, new products can be listed in just 75 days. This is significant for funds tied to ethereum, solana and dogecoin, or even diversified crypto baskets, as it dramatically reduces the barriers.” Alongside the rule change and proving there is demand for crypto ETFs beyond bitcoin and ethereum, the first U.S. ETFs to offer spot exposure to Ripple’s XRP and dogecoin started trading on Thursday, generating about $55 million in trading volume. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, listed on Cboe under the ticker XRPR, saw the largest debut volume of any ETF launch this year, according an X post by Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market In August, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci said it makes “zero sense" for BlackRock to ignore cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and ethereum. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying bitcoin and ethereum are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” Geraci posted to X. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holds almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024. BlackRock’s fund alone holds almost 4% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Title: Dogecoin Price Could Break Into Double-Digit Rally From This Fibonacci Level

The Dogecoin price has since retraced after its run to $0.3 as sell-offs had grown stronger over the last week. There is also the fact that the Fed had cut interest rates by a quarter of a point last week, but because it was already priced into the market, there was barely any reaction to it. As such, the Dogecoin price stalled and continued to follow the established downtrend. But as the meme coin ushers in a new week, there is the possibility of a recovery and even a rally from here. Crypto analyst MadWhale outlined some notable developments surrounding the Dogecoin price and what could trigger the next wave of price action. Besides the Fed rate cuts not doing anything for the crypto market, there is also the expectation of multiple altcoin ETFs that could trigger the next rally. Recently, excitement around a possible Dogecoin ETF going live for trading has been on the rise after experts had projected a possible acceptance by the SEC last week. The decision was ultimately postponed by the regulator, but this has done nothing to dampen the excitement. The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) is still expected to go live sometime this month if the SEC gives its blessing, and the analyst explains that this could be what drives another rally. In fact, there have been expectations that the Dogecoin price could rise by up to 75%, and others have predicted that the price could double. In addition to the ETF excitement, the fact that Dogecoin whales are making their way back into the arena is exciting. With around $266 million worth of DOGE bought and withdrawn from exchanges, exchange liquidity has declined, pushing the supply down to help boost demand and trigger a possible price increase. Besides the bullish developments surrounding the Dogecoin price with the ETF filings and whale buying, there is also the technical side that points to bullishness. This is because the Dogecoin price is currently sitting close to a critical Fibonacci level. If the Dogecoin price continues to maintain both its daily support and weekly trendline above $0.24, then the analyst expects an 18% increase in price, to push it toward $0.315. Other bullish developments include the Grayscale filing with the SEC to convert its Dogecoin Trust into a full-blown ETF. The filing lists Coinbase as custodian, sticking to an established pattern with Grayscale’s crypto ETFs, and could be a rival to the highly anticipated REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF.
