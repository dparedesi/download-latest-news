Blockchain technology is receiving a boost with the XRP Ledger, based on recent findings from industry observers. The system has handled over 2.8 billion transactions without any security failure, which has caught the eye of financial institutions globally. According to Jasmine Cooper, RippleX Head of Product, the effectiveness of XRPL is one of the major reasons institutional investors are drawn to it. Institutional asset issuers and investors are using XRPL more because of its speed and reliability. For example, OpenEden has recently hit milestones in tokenizing US Treasury bills on the platform. Institutional investors are purchasing these tokenized assets that desire access to on-chain financial instruments. BlackRock, the global asset management titan, is also making a push into asset tokenization, lining up with XRPL’s platform. Regulated exchanges like Archax are even listing tokenized assets created on the ledger, and it’s becoming more acceptable to mainstream financial institutions. XRP Ledger Adoption is Surging! Institutions, DeFi, Stablecoins, Tokenization Jasmine Cooper, Head of Product at RippleX, joined me to discuss the latest and the greatest with the XRP Ledger. 02:34 Jasmine’s background 04:43 Real Estate on Blockchain 06:18 RippleX overview… pic.twitter.com/HkC2ubbflA — Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) March 23, 2025 XRPL is revolutionizing the way people buy and sell real estate by enabling tokenization. Firms such as Propy utilize it to facilitate automatic property sales, minimizing paperwork and accelerating transactions. This facilitates real estate trading and makes it more accessible. This change might have a huge effect on an industry that is normally sluggish and convoluted. Through blockchain, XRPL assists in making transactions easy yet secure and reliable. DeFi on XRPL is gaining traction, owing to fresh technology such as the Automated Market Maker (AMM). The functionality allows traders to exchange assets and provide liquidity directly on the blockchain, eliminating the role of centralized exchanges. RippleX is also looking to simplify XRPL for developers. The firm is introducing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that enables developers to create Ethereum-based smart contracts with the advantage of XRPL’s low-cost, high-speed transactions. This element is likely to have more DeFi projects hitting the ledger and improve its connectivity with other blockchain networks. Ripple recently rolled out RLUSD, a new US dollar-backed stablecoin, on a small number of small crypto exchanges. The stablecoin will be applied in cross-border payments and liquidity. RippleX is said to be seeking regulatory approval to ensure that RLUSD meets the regulations, which could make it more appealing to institutional users. The stablecoin is positioned as an adjunct to XRP, already employed as an international bridge currency. If the RLUSD gains traction, adoption of the XRPL network is likely to further increase.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: A $41B Investment Firm Wants to Stick With Just Bitcoin ETFs as Safer Bet

Earlier this year, Calamos made its crypto debut with the launch of not one but three funds designed to protect investors from the volatility in bitcoin’s (BTC) price. But the global investment management firm, which handles $41.3 billion in assets, is far from launching any other products beyond bitcoin, — even Ethereum (ETH), said its head of ETFs Matt Kaufman in an interview with CoinDesk. Since their inception, Calamos’ protected BTC funds have attracted over $100 million from investors, which primarily include financial advisors. For most firms looking to make an entrance into the crypto market, launching a bitcoin product is just the first step in a long journey that quickly extends to ethereum-based products. BlackRock, for example, applied to launch its spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in June 2023 and five months later, did the same for Ethereum (ETH). “Ethereum doesn’t really meet our criteria for being able to effectively hedge that exposure,” he said. “It’s not a liquid asset, there’s no options on Ethereum ETPs so if those check boxes start to get built, we’ll explore it but right now it’s not on our radar.” The Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOJ), Calamos Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXJ) and Calamos Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTJ) offer investors 80-100% downside protection with an upside cap rate of 10-55%. This is achieved by using a combination of Treasuries and options on the CBOE Bitcoin US ETF Index. While Cboe Exchange has filed to list options tied to Ether ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January delayed its deadline to approve or deny the product. The Commission will have to stick to the final deadline in May, however. Another asset class that Calamos won’t likely ever touch is meme coins, Kaufman said. “We’re a risk manager, so we build things we know will work,” he said. “From that perspective, I don’t have any opinion on meme coins but it’s not something I would ever do.” Kaufman believes that the recent surge in applications for meme coin ETFs highlights the fact that investors have to do their due diligence. “We live in America, you have to know what you own. Freedom gives you choice and with choice comes responsibility,” he said.

Title: EXCLUSIVE: ESG Ruling Puts New Pressure on Public Pension Funds and BlackRock

He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL—A federal court ruling regarding ESG investing with BlackRock could put public pension funds on the defense, a consumer group is warning. Consumers’ Research sent letters to the largest public pensions boards in each state Tuesday warning BlackRock’s focus on ESG–an acronym for environmental, social, and governance–could lead to serious liabilities and a breach of fiduciary duty and put trillions of dollars in American pension money at risk. In a first-of-its kind federal court decision on ESG, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor, of the Northern District of Texas, held in January in the case of Spence v. American Airlines that the airline’s pension was in breach of its fiduciary duty for allowing BlackRock to weigh ESG consideration in employees’ retirement plans. BlackRock was not a party in the lawsuit. “In Spence, offering BlackRock funds in the company’s 401(k) plans violated the company’s duty to focus only on financial returns because publicly available evidence put the plan fiduciaries on notice that BlackRock uses its funds to pursue goals other than financial returns—like the ESG goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” says the letter shared with The Daily Signal. BlackRock, based in New York, had an asset portfolio totaling $11.6 trillion in 2024. It has come under fire in recent years not only for ESG investing but also for ties to China, as well as having former executives in highly placed administration positions under President Joe Biden. The company also leveraged its resources to push changes to the board of ExxonMobil. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported BlackRock broke with climate groups and eliminated diversity targets in a story headlined, “BlackRock’s ‘Woke’ Era is Over.” However, Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, contends BlackRock is still promoting net-zero carbon and is trying to rebrand. “This ruling shows there could be lawsuits against the state pension fund or lawsuits against pension trustees,” Hild told The Daily Signal. “ESG investing is a danger to pension holders, a danger to taxpayers, and a danger to pension trustees that could be held personally liable.” He said he’s hopeful this will change the investment strategy of the firm going forward. “This is not a vendetta against BlackRock, but I am opposed to pushing a political agenda with people’s retirement,” Hild added. American Airlines investments reportedly did not have ESG objectives and did not underperform. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” a BlackRock spokesperson told The Daily Signal. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” The court ruling stemmed from a class action lawsuit by American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence with more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. O’Connor, an appointee of George W. Bush, said in the opinion, “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the plan.” American Airlines did not immediately respond to an inquiry for this story. The Consumers’ Research letter Tuesday asserts state pension boards should review their investment with BlackRock to ensure similar problems—such as politicized investments—aren’t happening. “In conclusion, any state pension board using BlackRock to manage its pension plans is now on notice that a federal court has found that BlackRock acted with an ‘investment strategy … focused on ESG investing’ and ‘a pursuit of non-pecuniary interests,’ and fiduciaries of a fund that invested with BlackRock breached their duty of loyalty,” the letter continues. In January, Consumers’ Research sent a letter to all Fortune 500 companies warning of potential fiduciary duty violations and investment with BlackRock.

Title: Solana Rises As BlackRock Brings Its $1,700,000,000 Tokenized Treasury Fund to Ethereum Rival’s Chain

Solana (SOL) is green on the day on reports that BlackRock is moving its blockchain-based money market fund onto the Ethereum (ETH) competitor’s network. Fortune reports that the world’s largest asset manager is adding its $1.7 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana blockchain. Solana is trading for $145 at time of writing, up nearly 19% in the last week. Launched a year ago, BUIDL uses traditional money market funds, which investors use to store cash in the near term and earn yield on it, combined with blockchain payment properties. Solana is now the seventh blockchain compatible with the tokenized money market fund BUIDL, after its initial launch on Ethereum. BlackRock’s technology partner, Securitize, says the fund is expected to exceed $2 billion in cash and Treasury bills by early April. Says Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, “We’re making [money market funds] unboring. We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” One benefit BUIDL offers over traditional money market funds is 24/7 trading. Says Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, “Our vision for why on-chain finance adds more value is because you can do more things with those assets on chain than you could if [they’re] sitting in your brokerage account.” BUIDL is part of BlackRock’s long-term digital asset strategy, which includes its spot-Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the future of finance includes the “tokenization of every financial asset.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Should We Compare Bitcoin to Gold? Lessons From the Last Financial Crisis

Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:53:32Z
Full Content:
A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton’s Rahul Kapoor and Lehigh University’s Natalya Vinokurova explain the risks associated with a common argument for investing in Bitcoin: comparing it to gold. Rahul Kapoor Rahul Kapoor, Natalya Vinokurova The following article was written by Wharton management professor Rahul Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova, associate professor of management at the College of Business at Lehigh University. Bitcoin is now priced at almost a hundred thousand dollars with a total market of almost two trillion dollars. A common argument promoting investment in Bitcoin compares it to gold — a time-tested store of value and a safe haven for generating significant investment returns. How credible is that analogy, and more importantly, what is the risk that comes with it? We are in a good position to address this issue. One of us has studied the development and adoption of technological innovations for more than two decades; the other has researched the connection between innovation, analogies, and financial crises. Let’s think about where the great financial crisis of 2008 came from. Investors accepted the analogy of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to bonds. MBS are a class of investments that entitle the investor to a fraction of cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages in the securities’ collateral. While MBS carried risks that were quite different from bonds (such as the systemic risk of a house price correction across the economy), they were rated by the same credit rating agencies as bonds. Consequently, even conservative investors such as pension funds were willing to invest in these new supposedly safe securities. However, the analogy masked several aspects of the financial system: leverage in the system, lack of transparency about which investors owned what, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and inadequate risk management tools. Combined, these factors turned MBS into the opposite of safe assets both for the investors holding them and the society at large. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. However, they almost always carry the risk of masking features that could be fundamentally important in the role that the innovation plays with respect to its intended use, resulting in unintended negative consequences, such as the financial crisis of 2008. Analogies are powerful mechanisms to help people and organizations make sense of a new idea or innovation. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, has been increasingly referred to as digital gold, emphasizing its modern digital nature as a store of value, with limited supply that is decentralized (not controlled by central banks) and operating on blockchain technology architecture. Accordingly, it has been pitched as a vehicle for investors enthusiastic about technology and seeking long-term financial gains that provide a hedge against inflation and are immune to economic cycles. Buyers and institutions are increasingly explaining their decision to invest in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in terms of it being the new digital gold. For example, the BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a Bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been “wrong” about Bitcoin and now believes Bitcoin is “digital gold” and a “legitimate” financial instrument. State Street forecasts that cryptocurrency ETFs will surpass precious metal ETFs in North American assets by the end of 2025, becoming the third-largest asset class in the $15 trillion ETF industry. While the similarities between Bitcoin and gold, emphasized in marketing campaigns and expert commentaries, are appealing and reasonably uncontroversial, they mask some important differences concerning the structure of value and the nature of ownership. Unlike Bitcoin, gold has physical properties as a precious metal that are attractive for many applications, including jewelry, electronics, and medicine. In fact, it is estimated that more than half of the global gold reserve is used in such applications, with the rest held by central banks or private investors. Moreover, the quality of gold (with respect to the metal purity) can be ascertained through simple scientific tests. Accordingly, the structure of value for gold is much more tangible and transparent than that of Bitcoin. While gold has a history of holding its value in times of societal cataclysms such as wars, it is not clear that Bitcoin could survive a major power grid failure. The lack of transparency in the value structure of Bitcoin has led to speculative trading, involving individuals who don’t have the expertise necessary to understand the basis of value or critically evaluate the prospects of long-term returns. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and mortgage-backed securities suggest that history may be repeating itself. While the blockchain ledger provides a public database of Bitcoin ownership and transactions, there is little information about who owns what. This dearth of public and common knowledge about who owns Bitcoin is eerily reminiscent of the aftermath of the MBS crisis in which major financial institutions discovered — to their surprise — that they held the risk that they believed they had passed on to other players. Today, pension funds from Wisconsin, Michigan, the UK, and Australia have begun investing in Bitcoin, primarily through regulated U.S. ETFs. This move is driven by Bitcoin’s substantial value increase and a pro-crypto U.S. administration. This is a pattern that is quite similar to pension funds investing in MBS without fully understanding the risks. It has been estimated that a large majority of Bitcoins are owned by individual investors who own a small fraction of a single Bitcoin. This fragmentation and lack of transparency of ownership of a speculative asset presents systemic risk. The opaque structure of value, the absence of a unified regulatory framework, and the willingness of major financial institutions to sell these arcane products to less sophisticated investors suggest that Bitcoin has more similarities with MBS than it has with gold. A critical ingredient of the 2008 mortgage crisis was the willingness of leaders of major financial institutions to go along with leveraged trading in securities that they did not understand due to the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the next big thing. These are exactly the patterns we are seeing in Bitcoin trading today. The striking parallels between Bitcoin and MBS suggest that history may be repeating itself. In fact, the negative consequences of the analogy of Bitcoin to gold might be even more severe than the analogy of MBS to bonds. While most MBS at the end of the day were backed by real assets — mortgages on real houses — Bitcoin is not backed by any real assets. If you are not in the business of speculation, steering clear of investing in Bitcoin — or for that matter any cryptocurrency — may be the best way to avoid the fallout from another misguided analogy.

Title: BlackRock taps Solana for BUIDL tokenized fund as Bitcoin ETP debuts in Europe

BlackRock introduces Bitcoin ETP in Europe and integrates BUIDL to Solana in strategic blockchain embrace. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest investment firm in the world with over $11 trillion in assets under management, made two significant moves on March 25 to increase its presence in the crypto industry. The firm has extended its tokenized money market fund to the Solana blockchain and introduced its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in the European market. BlackRock has launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP across major European markets. According to the product’s website, the ETP will begin trading on March 25 on Germany’s Xetra exchange, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The product trades under the ticker IB1T on Xetra and Paris and BTCN in Amsterdam. To encourage adoption, the ETP is debuting with a reduced fee of 0.15%, which will remain in effect until 2026. After that, the fees will increase to 0.25%, aligning with similar regional offerings. This launch follows the strong performance of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in the US, which currently manages over $50 billion in assets. According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based fund now holds approximately 2.9% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply. In a separate development, BlackRock’s tokenized fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), is now live on Solana. This marks the seventh blockchain to support the fund, following earlier rollouts on Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Aptos, Polygon, and Optimism. Securitize, BlackRock’s partner for BUIDL, explained that it expanded the product to Solana because of the blockchain network’s fast transaction speeds and low network fees. Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said: “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” BUIDL tokenizes traditional money market funds, offering the benefits of blockchain-based settlement and 24/7 trading. This contrasts with conventional funds that operate within limited market hours. Currently, BUIDL manages over $1.7 billion in assets, primarily in cash and short-term US Treasury bills. Ethereum hosts the bulk of these holdings—over $1.5 billion—while the remaining assets are distributed across other supported blockchains. Aptos and Avalanche each hold around $53 million, followed by Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, which have $33 million, $32 million, and $27 million, respectively.

According to the BaFin, the sUSDe offer "profit promises," potentially classifying it as a security. This marks the third time this year that the European Central Bank urged for the digital euro launch. The Czech National Bank's Bitcoin deliberation is clouded by regulation gaps and instability concerns. GameStop shares jumped over 7% in the after-market following the announcement.

A new €16 million dedicated women’s health centre is to open in Dublin in the autumn. The clinic will be run by Blackrock Health, which is the umbrella company formed by businessman Larry Goodman after he took full control of three of the best-known private hospitals in the State – Blackrock Clinic, Hermitage Clinic and Galway Clinic. The new facility, which will be called Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, will create 50 new jobs. The group said the centre will be the “most comprehensive” private, consultant-led women’s health centre of its kind in Ireland. Planning permission was granted for the facility in recent weeks. The clinic, which will be located at 2-5 Warrington Place, Dublin 2, will offer 340 outpatient appointments per day, and will provide access to a range of consultant-led and allied health services in an environment designed exclusively around the needs of women. The centre will offer consultant-led clinics in gynaecology, urology, breast health, endocrinology, gastroenterology, pain medicine, cardiology, dermatology, plastics and aesthetics, psychology and psychotherapy, health screening, and rheumatology. These services will be complemented by a full suite of allied health offerings, including physiotherapy, urodynamics, phlebotomy, and advanced radiology diagnostics including Dexa scanning, mammography, and ultrasound. Blackrock Health chief executive Dr Caroline Whelan said: “We understand the health concerns of the nation, how they have evolved and why now is the time to deliver care that is tailored to women. “That is why we are so proud to invest €16 million to open the Blackrock Health Women’s Health Centre, offering holistic care that treats the healthcare issues that are specific to women, specifically for women.” The investment by Blackrock Health is in addition to the €500 million investment announced in September. Blackrock Health employs more than 3000 staff and counts 600 consultants in 50 medical specialities on its books. Together, its hospitals have a total of 418 inpatient beds including 28 ICU beds and 22 operating theatres. Together, the group cared for more than 360,000 patients last year. Blackrock Health is part of Parma Health, a division of Mr Goodman’s Parma Group.

Title: If You’re in Crypto, Pivot to AI Now

For years, crypto’s positioned itself as the next great technological revolution. But as we witness the explosive rise of AI, it's time for crypto to face the truth: the true technological revolution of our era is artificial intelligence, and crypto will play a supporting role rather than be the star. This isn't about diminishing the industry’s importance or the quality of what it’s built. I helped pioneer institutional investing in Bitcoin, and I’ve operated and invested in numerous companies building on-chain. I also earned a Ph.D in AI. The simple truth is that building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems should be the mission, whether or not blockchain rails are included. With respect to pure crypto, the only segment left standing is DeFi. Objectively a better version of TradFi, DeFi boasts better engineering, programmability, and composability. This is properly captured with the meme: Internet Capital Markets. Stablecoins and tokenization have shown exceptional product-market-fit, and they remain crypto’s truest (read: only) demonstration of real tangible value to date. As such, the institutions are coming, and for good reason. BlackRock, Robinhood, and even crypto-native stalwarts like Coinbase are building out crypto products in the expectation of imminent regulatory clarity. Moving instant global payments and settlement along with more complex financial instruments on-chain is a no-brainer. Otherwise, there’s AI. There’s TradAI like the big labs, model builders, and LLM providers. There’s open-weight AI like DeepSeek and Mistral. There’s open-source AI like Nous. AI apps like Cursor and Lovable. Agents like Manus. Robotics. And even Decentralized AI or Crypto x AI (we’ll get to that in a minute…). In short, there's already more demand for AI products and services than there has ever been for pure crypto applications. This is captured by another meme: if you’re in crypto, pivot to AI. This shouldn't surprise us. While crypto has struggled to find mainstream use cases beyond speculation and gambling, AI is already improving productivity and working its way into transforming industries everywhere across the world. What’s more? A sobering reality for crypto – further accentuated by recent memecoin activity and what’s been colloquially called “crime szn” – has been the disconnect between token values and actual technological utility. While decentralized technology itself is revolutionary, the value captured by tokens has historically been driven more by memetic appeal than by genuine technological value creation (there have been calls to get grounded in “fundamentals” as of late, but we’ll see if it has legs…). This isn't necessarily a criticism – meme value is real value in many ways – but it highlights a fundamental weakness of crypto as a standalone industry. This doesn't mean crypto’s rekt. In fact, blockchain and crypto protocols may become essential components of a future AI tech stack. But they'll serve as infrastructure underlying AI-first products and services, rather than as standalone products. Consider ways to Make AI Cheap Again: distributed computing power for training and inference, verifiable computation and data provenance, tokenized access to computational resources, decentralized storage of training data, and transparent reward mechanisms for contribution. Distributed computing and DePIN architectures as well as transparent verification systems have proven their utility. But – and this is crucial – they'll do so in service of AI products and services that solve real problems for mainstream users who neither know nor care about the underlying technical infrastructure. We could envision protocols built using blockchains generating revenue through licensing or usage and being paid in other tokenized forms of value like stablecoins – a model in stark contrast to the token-as-the-product model currently a la mode. For founders and teams currently focused on crypto-native applications, this represents both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is expanding beyond the comfortable but limited crypto ecosystem, represented primarily by Crypto Twitter and [Insert Your Favorite Conference Here]. The opportunity is participating in the genuine technological revolution that AI represents. What does this mean in practice? First, teams need to start thinking bigger. Founders should be asking themselves how AI can transform their target market, and then consider how crypto technology might help enable that transformation. This means fundamentally changing how we approach building and marketing crypto products. Instead of starting with tokenization, tokenomics, or even blockchains in general, begin with real-world problems that AI could solve. Only then should teams identify where decentralized systems could enhance the AI, and implement these pieces of the stack where they genuinely add value. Leverage crypto where it makes sense, especially where it can mitigate costs or improve efficiency, but keep the focus squarely on delivering value through intelligence and automation. For example, companies could use blockchains to create decentralized marketplaces for critical processes, making AI more accessible and cost-effective (Vast.ai, a Nazaré portfolio company, does this for GPUs, and Orchid has been re-defining the internet and privacy with decentralized markets for years). Agents might also use cryptographic verification or privacy systems to safely and securely act on our behalf online using our login information, identities and credit cards, or even private keys and wallets on-chain. In both cases, crypto serves the larger goal of making AI systems more effective and trustworthy. The companies that will thrive in this new landscape are those that understand this dynamic. They will either build AI-first products that incorporate crypto where it adds genuine value, or they will build crypto services explicitly designed to improve AI-based products or services. The market won’t support teams running around wielding the hammer that is blockchains treating everything like a nail. Ultimately, this is about properly understanding the relationship between crypto and AI. The future belongs to AI as the primary framework while thoughtfully incorporating crypto where appropriate. For much of the crypto industry, this is a moment of truth and a profound recalibration. We can either cling to the narrative of crypto as a standalone revolution and speculative tokens as retail products, or we can embrace crypto's supporting role as excellent technology in service of AI. The latter may be less glamorous (and perhaps less valuable to investment portfolios), but it's ultimately more likely to create real lasting value and impact. The sooner we accept this reality, the better positioned we'll be to contribute meaningfully to the technological transformation that's already underway. It's time for the crypto industry to think bigger than itself. If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.

Title: Enormous Bitcoin Whale Awakens After 8 Years Of Dormancy As Another Scoops Up $200 Million In BTC

A Bitcoin whale wallet dating back to late 2016 woke up from dormancy after over eight years and moved 3,000 BTC in a single transaction. The reactivation coincides with a recent resurgence for the apex crypto. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $87,700 as of publication time, according to data provider CoinGecko. As BTC stages a relief rally on Tuesday amid talks of the upcoming U.S. tariffs, due on April 2, being narrower than originally feared, a whale that has been asleep for 8 years is waking up this week. According to data from blockchain sleuth Arkham Intelligence, the whale has moved 3,000 Bitcoin, valued at $250 million at the time of the transfer. “His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today— and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote in a recent post on the X platform. The movement of BTC from very old wallets often sparks curiosity among crypto community members. In recent years, numerous dormant wallets have come out of hibernation only to transfer the BTC holdings to a new address. Some of these wallets were also discovered to have shifted their BTC stashes to crypto exchanges, suggesting they were looking to take profits after many years of HODLing. Meanwhile, a billionaire Bitcoin whale is adding to their stockpile. Arkham pointed out in a different X post that the whale snatched up 2,400 BTC, worth approximately $200 million, on March 24. According to Arkham Intelligence, the whale in question started buying Bitcoin only five days ago after selling its cache in February when the asset’s price was hovering at around $100K and $86K. Data from CoinGecko indicates that BTC was trading at around $104,000 on February 1 and plunged to $78K lows by the end of that month. Another massive BTC holder, BlackRock, has also been adding to its Bitcoin stockpile over the last week as well. Per Arkham data, the world’s largest asset manager with $11 trillion in assets under management, bought a further 4,054 Bitcoin across 15 separate transactions, bringing its total holdings to 573,878 BTC, or over $50 billion.

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has become available on Solana, Securitize announced, marking another step in the asset manager’s push into blockchain-based finance. The expansion makes BUIDL available on seven blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Aptos, Arbitrum and Optimism. Only 62 wallets currently hold BUIDL on-chain, however, according to rwa.zyz data. The fund, officially the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, combines a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries with the settlement and transfer capabilities of blockchain. Since its introduction on Ethereum in 2023, the fund has drawn in $1.7 billion and is on track to cross $2 billion by early April, according to Securitize. “In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, in a statement. “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Money market funds typically allow investors to earn interest on idle cash, but they come with trading limitations such as limited operating hours. Blockchain versions like BUIDL allow for constant access. BlackRock isn’t alone. Franklin Templeton offers a similar tokenized fund that currently has a $692 billion market capitalization and 558 holders, and Figure Markets recently launched YLDS, an interest-bearing stablecoin. Other major tokenized treasury funds include the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin (USYC) and Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing nearly sixfold over the past year and recently crossing $5 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show.

Share this article BlackRock, overseeing $11.6 trillion in client assets, is bringing its tokenized treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund, also known as BUIDL, to Solana, Fortune reported on March 25. The fund has attracted around $1.7 billion in assets under management since its launch, according to data from RWA.xyz. With this integration, Solana becomes the seventh supported chain for the BUIDL fund, which currently operates on Ethereum, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. The move comes after Franklin Templeton announced the launch of its money market fund, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, or FOBXX on Solana. Franklin’s tokenized treasury fund currently ranks as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, only after BlackRock’s BUIDL and Hashnote’s USYC fund. The BUIDL fund operates 24/7, unlike traditional money market funds limited to business hours, providing crypto traders with a yield-generating alternative to non-interest-bearing stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Earlier this month, BUIDL became the first tokenized fund from a Wall Street institution to achieve the $1 billion milestone. A spokesperson for Securitize, which serves as the tokenization provider for BUIDL, expects the fund to exceed $2 billion in early April. “We’re making them unboring,” Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize, told Fortune. “We are advancing and leapfrogging some of the quote-unquote deficiencies that money markets may have in their traditional formats.” Securitize announced January its integration with the Solana blockchain in January. The firm aims to expand the accessibility and adoption of tokenized real-world assets, and Solana’s technology provides the necessary infrastructure to support this goal. The expansion follows BlackRock’s growing presence in crypto markets, including its spot-Bitcoin ETF launch in January 2024, which has attracted nearly $40 billion according to crypto analytics firm SoSoValue. “ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC in January. “Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. 03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

BySarah Whitmire andForbes Daily BySarah Whitmire Forbes Staff andForbes Daily Forbes Staff. Whether the “R” word is on the horizon or not, troubling U.S. consumer data is beginning to pile up. Consumer sentiment is at a 15-month low, credit card delinquency is on the rise, and nearly half of U.S. adults don’t have three months of emergency savings. In such times, it could be tempting to dip into a retirement account—and there are a number of exemptions (both new and old) that will allow you to do so without paying a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Barring these exceptions, it’s wise to consider other options. Having to pay the penalty, plus tax on the distribution itself, can add up fast—and that’s without getting into lost gains from what you pull out. Check with a tax pro or benefits administrator to ensure you don’t make a poor financial situation worse. Stocks gained Monday on a reported tariff reprieve. Markets popped Monday on news that President Donald Trump would walk back previously announced reciprocal tariffs in key industries, driving a 1.8% lift on the S&P 500, a 1.4% increase for the Dow, and a 2.3% jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The most notable gainers were the “Magnificent Seven” big American technology stocks, including a near 12% surge for troubled EV maker Tesla. Trump is referring to the April 2 rollout of his reciprocal tariffs as “Liberation Day,” though he continues to express flexibility in his tariff plans. Semiconductors and cars will both be exempted from next week’s actions, for instance, and the president said he “may give a lot of countries breaks” and that his plans are “reciprocal, but we may be even nicer than that,” signaling the U.S. may not even match the tariff rates American goods face abroad. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Chuck Schumer was gearing up for a tour to promote his newly published book Antisemitism In America when his day job got in the way—the tour was postponed after the Senate minority leader faced backlash for supporting the Republican’s spending bill and avoiding a government shutdown. Still, this bump in the road won’t impact Schumer’s own bottom line much, as the career politician is worth about $7 million, Forbes estimates, a number built almost entirely on his Brooklyn condo and retirement savings. U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Monday that “nobody was texting war plans” after The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief published an article saying he was accidentally added to a Signal group where top Trump Administration officials discussed plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen. Hegseth’s denial comes despite the National Security Council saying screenshots of the chat appeared “to be an authentic message chain,” as the defense secretary faces heavy backlash. The Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to throw out a district court ruling that required the government to reinstate probationary employees that were fired from six key agencies last month. The administration’s filing argues that “the lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch” employment decisions, and it comes after Trump officials have publicly criticized unfavorable rulings by district court judges. MORE: U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg rejected the Trump Administration’s separate request to throw out an order that barred the administration from deporting immigrants under an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling comes as reports emerge of migrants who were wrongly identified as gang members, and deported to El Salvador. Illustration by Alice Lagarde for Forbes; photos by Rich Storry/getty images; Peter Joneleit/Icon Sportswire/Newscom; Orlando Ramirez/Stringer/getty images; Daniel Shirey/Stringer/getty images Two of Major League Baseball’s brightest stars have reached a level that just a handful of professional athletes have ever seen: a $100 million season. The New York Mets’ new outfielder Juan Soto and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani are set to collect an estimated $126.9 million and $102 million in 2025, respectively. They easily lead Forbes’ latest list of Baseball’s Highest-Paid Players, with the top 10 earners set to be paid a combined $576 million this year—a 25% increase from 2024’s record total. Social media giant X said the Turkish government has requested blocks on more than 700 accounts amid protests over the controversial arrest of Istanbul’s mayor—but the company called the request “unlawful,” adding that “X will always defend freedom of speech.” However, over the weekend, Politico Europe reported that X had already suspended a number of accounts in Turkey “belonging to opposition figures.” A government contractor and lobbyist who served in President Donald Trump’s first administration bought Vice President JD Vance’s Northern Virginia home for $1.9 million—about $170,000 over the asking price, according to government records and real estate listings. A spokesperson for the buyer said the offer was based solely on market factors, and that the purchase had no connection to the buyer’s government work or political ties. U.S. businesses no longer have to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting filing requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act. That’s the result of an interim final rule issued this month that removes the requirement for U.S. companies to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Previously, reporting requirements applied to businesses created in the U.S. and foreign companies registered to do business in any U.S. state or Indian tribe. If finalized, the rule would exempt more than 99% of entities from reporting. Beretta CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta For 14 generations, the Beretta family has sold firearms. While they’re known for handguns and shotguns, current CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta, a 15th-generation descendant of the Beretta founders, saw a more well-rounded future for the world’s oldest gunmaker. Since becoming CEO in 1995, Pietro has helped remake the 499-year-old company—which is still family-owned—by scooping up firms making everything from rifles to luxury clothing. In 2022, for instance, Beretta purchased Ammotec, Europe’s largest maker of ammunition and pyrotechnics, and added $600 million to their annual sales. It’s now the world’s largest firearms company with $1.7 billion in revenues in 2024. “The three legs of our business are hunters, soldiers and policemen. They need guns, clothing and optics,” he says, referring to scopes and red dot sights designed to improve a firearm’s aim. “The last piece we needed was ammunition. With this latest deal, we finally closed the circle.” Before the acquisition, civilian sales accounted for 86% of the company’s revenues, making it dependent on the whims of hunters and gun enthusiasts—particularly in the U.S., the world’s largest firearms market, which makes up 37% of Beretta’s sales. When Covid-19 sent gun sales to American civilians surging, Beretta reaped the rewards, with its North American revenues increasing by 62% from 2019 to 2021. But Pietro knew that would not last forever. Beretta took advantage of that growth in the U.S. civilian market to build closer ties with military and police forces around the world, helping the company “rebalance,” Pietro said. Now, defense and law enforcement sales make up 34% of Beretta Holding’s revenues, up from just 14% four years ago. WHY IT MATTERS It’s a smart time to bet on the military, Forbes’ Giacomo Tognini writes. Defense spending by European countries hit a record $350 billion in 2024 as leaders sought to rearm following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That’s set to grow even further, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan in March—right after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would pause military aid to Ukraine—to provide EU countries with $160 billion in loans to invest in their armed forces. MORE As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock A number of factors have led more American workers to take on multiple jobs, from the rising cost of living to an increasingly competitive job market. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that it sees the highest number of workers with multiple jobs since it began tracking the metric in 1994: 8.9 million: The number of Americans who now work multiple jobs 50.2%: The share of people holding multiple jobs in 2024 who have a college degree, up from 45.1% in 2019 34.1: The number of hours in an average workweek for employees on private nonfarm payrolls last month, down from 34.3 in February 2024, as some employers cut back on hours Student loan borrowers are in a difficult position, as the Trump Administration has taken a number of actions in the past months to upend repayment and loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should take steps now to stay ahead of the shifting landscape, including periodically logging into their Department of Education account and downloading key records, saving month-by-month payment records from their loan servicer account, and even reviewing their credit reports for possible errors as a result of the recent disruptions.

Title: French wealth management fintech RockFi garners €18m funding

Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:41:39Z

RockFi, a fintech company specialising in private wealth management, has raised €18m ($19.45m) in a Series A funding round led by Partech. The round also saw participation from existing investor Varsity and business angels, including Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser, co-founders of Pennylane, and Mark Ransford, former managing director of Apax UK. With this fresh capital, RockFi aims to fast-track its expansion and reach its target of managing €1bn in assets by the close of 2026. The company secured fresh funding less than a year after raising €3m in its initial fundraising round. Based in France, the fintech was established in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand—alongside former private banking executives such as Stéphane Carles (formerly of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (formerly of HSBC Gestion Privée). RockFi aims to transform private wealth management with its technology-driven platform and network of independent private bankers. The company serves a diverse clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, “top” athletes, and artists, offering a blend of human expertise and digital solutions for wealth management. Marin, who is also the CEO, said: “We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. “This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and – eventually – across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management.” RockFi said its family office approach provides clients with dedicated private advisors who craft comprehensive investment strategies covering financial investments, taxation, and estate planning. The platform offers 3,000 financial instruments across various asset classes, with an emphasis on private equity through partnerships with firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs. The fintech’s proprietary technology platform is said to enable clients to access “real-time” asset tracking and analytics. Less than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi claims to have attracted 500 clients, achieving a monthly business growth of over 25%. The company has expanded its workforce to 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, across six offices in France. Over the next year, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month in cities such as Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. The company also plans to double its team of 12 engineers to enhance its monitoring and reporting capabilities. As part of the funding, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and general partner at Partech, is joining the board of directors. Collombel added: “We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model – combining a technological platform with human expertise – addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. “The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform.”

Title: Canada's Conservative Party Promises to Cut Mass Economic Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/25/canadas-conservative-party-promises-to-cut-mass-economic-migration/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T09:12:16Z
Full Content:
Canada’s conservative leader wants to win the nation’s April 28 national elections and is hammering Justin Trudeau’s replacement for supporting the massive legal immigration that has caused massive pocketbook damage to ordinary Canadians. The Conservative Party candidate is Pierre Poilievre. He is campaigning against Mark Carney, an international banker and Goldman Sachs executive who replaced the disgraced Justin Trudeau as head of Canada’s Liberal Party. The two parties are close in the polls as Poilievre slams Carney for supporting Trudeau’s very unpopular immigration policy. In 2015, the investor-led Century Initiative persuaded Trudeau to grow the economy by inflating the nation’s population from 36 million to 100 million by 2100. Since then, Trudeau has imported four million migrants — or 10 percent of the nation’s population, which is the equivalent of 33 million migrants in the United States. That huge population of legal migrants — which includes many Indians and migrants who are too old to work — inflicted an economic shock and massive economic damage to 30 million ordinary Canadians. It cut wages, exacerbated healthcare shortages, and spiked housing costs. It dropped workplace productivity and reduced corporate research. It also imported criminals, unexpected sanitary habits, unfamiliar foreign conflicts, and strange ethnic resentments. But the pocketbook and civic damage also wrecked Trudeau’s political career. So the party replaced Trudeau with Carney the international banker, who is now promising to continue the nation-wrecking immigration policy. However, Canada’s major investors and older citizens gained enormously. Trudeau’s mass migration inflated the stock market by 40 percent with a flood of consumers, renters, and low-wage workers. In the run-up to the April 28 national election, Poilievre is wrapping the Century Initiative around Carney’s political neck. On Monday, he told a student journalist: I will stop the insanity. I’m against of the Century Initiative. I voted against the Century Initiative in the House of Commons when it came up. It’s a radical, crazy idea meant for multinational corporate elites to bring in people from poor countries in large numbers, to take away Canadian jobs, drive wages down and profits up. Poilievre also promised lower migration: I want people to come here to numbers that can actually be housed, employed, and cared for — like we used to have. We used to have a great system. You know, people from around the world came here with nothing but a dream and a suitcase, and it worked. But in the last 10 years of the liberals, it’s got totally out of control. They’re growing the population by 1.2 million people a year and we’re only building 200,000 homes [a year], so our population is growing three times faster than our housing stock … I’m going to slow immigration down, and I have a very simple mathematical formula. The numbers we will let in this year will have to be lower than the number of homes we built in the previous year. So we’re always going to be adding homes faster than we add people. That focus on migration’s economic damage is more aggressive than Trump’s 2024 focus on migrant crime. Poilievre is also spotlighting Carney’s pro-migration advisor, Mark Wiseman who founded the Century Initiative. “By bringing on Mr. Wiseman, it shows that Mark Carney supports the liberal Century Initiative to nearly triple our population to 100 million,” Poilievre said on March 21. Wiseman is a former investor for the Canadian government, then a top banker at BlackRock until he was forced out, and is now a top advisor to Carney. In 2020, Wiseman touted mass migration as a way to offset government deficits, preserve government welfare spending, and expand business: “We have to invest in this country [via mass migration] … In fact, I believe that the vast majority of growth that we’ve had in Canada since the Second World War has come from the fact that we have brought new Canadians into our economy … Those Canadians pay taxes, those Canadians start businesses, those Canadians are entrepreneurial, and those Canadians are consumers, the new Canadians … I would personally advocate increasing our current immigration levels to somewhere closer to 500,000 [a year] … Keep in mind, these are consumers, these are taxpayers. These are people who are going to help us grow. In May 2023, Wiseman retweeted an op-ed that urged more migration, saying “100 million Canadians by 2100 may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” The article justified mass migration by saying: Larger populations mean lower fixed costs, per capita, and other economies of scale. At higher population density, transportation costs are lower. Larger economies typically generate more companies, meaning more competition for consumers. More startups and more innovators mean more chances of coming up with a “unicorn” product that conquers export markets. And so on. Wiseman’s policies were repeatedly praised by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration border czar, Alejandro Mayorkas. In September, the Cuban-border Mayorkas said: We look to the north, with Canada. Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. Mayrokas and his pro-migration business allies imported at least 12 million legal, semi-legal, and illegal migrants, so helping cause the political defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democrats’ myriad interest groups. Since November, President Donald Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance, has repeatedly spotlighted the economic damage caused by mass migration. More Canadians are recognizing the damage. “Per capita output in 2022 was roughly the same as in 2017,” The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on March 23. “Benjamin Reitzes, a macro strategist at Bank of Montreal, recently noted that the average annual growth in real GDP over the past 10 years was 1.8 per cent, but only 0.6 per cent after adjustments were made for population gains.” Carney, however, is trying to dodge the damage caused by mass migration by touting support from movie actor Mike Myers, spotlighting President Trump’s tariff plans, offering a complex economic plan and a rival tax cut, and promising to deregulate the economy and help Canadians: But he is being forced to talk about immigration. On March 23, for example, he promised to raise immigration and lamented the pocketbook damage to migrants — not Canadians — when he was asked if he would lower or raise migration inflows. Carney answered: Yeah, this is an important question. So the way I would characterize the situation is that post-Covid, there was a surge in immigration, both in temporary foreign workers and in foreign students, as well as permanent immigration. [But] we have not lived up to the bargain with those [immigrant] people. There’s not adequate housing [for immigrants], not everyone who came here for an education could get an education they would expect. And a consequence of that and many other aspects, but a [political] consequence of that is new caps that have been put in place on much lower levels of immigration, including temporary foreign workers, including foreign students. Those caps, or something similar to those levels, in my judgment, need to remain in place until we’ve expanded housing, [until] we’ve reabsorbed the levels of immigration that have happened in our country. Meanwhile, Canadians continue to suffer from mass migration. This month, a Canadian woman bitterly complained that she has to wait 13 months to get an MRI for a suspected brain tumor: I need an MRI to see if I have a fucking brain tumor. And go ahead, cuess what [date] it is? Go ahead. Guess! It is in 2026. 2026! … Cool. Canada, where healthcare is free, but only If you can afford to wait.

BlackRock (BLK), the global asset manager behind the largest U.S. spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe on Tuesday, its first crypto ETP outside North America. The iShares Bitcoin ETP started trading on Xetra and Euronext in Paris under the ticker IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN, according listing details on iShares' website. The company's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is by far the largest of the 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S., with net assets worth over $50 billion and cumulative net inflows of just under $40 billion, according to data tracked by SoSoValue. An equivalent product listed in Canada in January. Although the listing of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. at the start of 2024 was considered a watershed moment for the crypto industry, similar products have existed in Europe for several years as ETPs. Digital asset managers CoinShares and 21Shares have led the way, accounting for nine of the top 20 ETPs by assets between them, according to data tracked by ETFbook. CoinShares Physical Bitcoin ETP is the largest, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. Coinbase (COIN), which provides custody for IBIT, will do the same for the BlackRock's European product. The fee for the European ETP is temporarily reduced by 10 basis points to 0.15% until the end of 2025. BlackRock's ETP introduction was reported earlier by Bloomberg. UPDATE (March 25, 11:34 UTC): Adds trading started in first paragraph, Canada ETF in third, European industry in fourth.

Business FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is pictured outside its headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., May 25, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo LONDON : BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe, in a bid to tap growing demand for cryptocurrency exposure in new markets after attracting more than $50 billion into similar products in the United States. The world's largest asset manager has launched its 'iShares Bitcoin ETP', according to a BlackRock product page online, which is domiciled in Switzerland and listed in Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. Reuters previously reported on the planned launch last month. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products in the U.S. to track the spot price of bitcoin after the Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. It has partnered with Coinbase as custodian and Bank of New York Mellon as administrator on the latest product, the page said.

Title: Fidelity, Schwab Won’t Let You Trade Money Market ETFs (That Aren’t Theirs)

Time Published: 2025-03-25T08:33:28Z

My Money Blog In case you aren’t aware that a huge profit source for every broker is your idle cash, Bloomberg reports that Fidelity and Schwab are blocking all new purchase trades of new money market ETFs (gift article) from Blackrock and Texas Capital. Here’s what Fidelity and Schwab say about it: A Schwab spokesperson said its decision is consistent with the firm’s “long-standing approach” of only making available Schwab affiliate money-market mutual funds, while a Fidelity spokesperson said this is an extension of the company’s policy to “generally restrict” third-party money-market mutual funds. The inflows to those new ETFs weren’t even that big, making this an interesting development: Yet, the move stands out because trading platforms like Schwab and Fidelity typically don’t restrict exchange-traded funds, even if those funds are in competition with existing in-house offerings. Indeed, I hope this doesn’t start a trend of more bans of competitor ETFs. Fidelity and Blackrock have worked very closely together in the past, so this is probably rather awkward. For now, I still own lots of shares of iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and probably soon Vanguard 0-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (VBIL). Fidelity and Schwab haven’t banned those, yet. Of course, Vanguard continues to not play funny games with their money market sweep funds. C’mon Vanguard, time for your own money market ETF to create even more tension… I know that these brokers have to make their money somewhere, but they may have to become more transparent about it soon.

Title: BlackRock rolls out Bitcoin ETP in Europe after US ETF success, offers temporary fee cut

Share this article BlackRock, a leading global asset manager, has introduced a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, building on the success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has amassed $50.6 billion in assets under management as of the latest data. According to a March 25 report from Bloomberg, the iShares Bitcoin ETP will trade on Xetra and Euronext Paris as IB1T and on Euronext Amsterdam as BTCN. The product features a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, bringing its expense ratio to 0.15% through the end of the year. The fund is BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETP outside North America. BlackRock previously launched IBIT and iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, said that a mix of strong retail demand and growing interest from professional investors is driving real momentum. She added that BlackRock’s move into the European market both reflects this shift and helps push it forward. While Europe has long established a market for crypto ETPs, with over 160 products tracking various digital assets, its scale remains smaller than that of the US, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated in February. US spot ETFs, despite being only a year old, have captured approximately 91% of global market share, largely attributed to their competitive cost structures and high liquidity. The analyst suggested that if BlackRock could successfully replicate the US market’s dynamics, substantial market growth is plausible. However, he noted that risk tolerance among European investors is generally lower compared to their counterparts in the US and certain Asian regions. Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world. We kick so much ass when it comes to cost and liquidity. If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, altho keep in mind… pic.twitter.com/fwFDE84rhS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 5, 2025 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: US Private Equity Is Making Interesting Moves in the Indo-Pacific

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Have recent acquisitions by major U.S. firms been made on the basis of commercial considerations, or is there a geopolitical motive at play? The check-in hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I recently wrote about the de-listing of Malaysia Airports from the Malaysian stock exchange. It was taken over by a consortium of investors led by two government-linked investment vehicles: sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional and employee savings fund EPF. One of the other big partners is an investment fund called Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). GIP is an American investment fund that specializes in infrastructure. As of 2024, it had around $100 billion in assets under management across a range of industries including energy, digital infrastructure, logistics, and transportation. Its portfolio was mainly concentrated in Europe and America. There have been some big developments over the last year. At the end of 2024, American private equity giant BlackRock completed a $12.5 billion acquisition of GIP. Combined with BlackRock’s existing infrastructure portfolio, the deal brings their total infrastructure assets under management to more than $150 billion. We’ve also seen that since the deal was announced, GIP has made some interesting shifts in its investment strategy. First, in March 2024, GIP announced it had raised over $2 billion with an inaugural emerging markets fund. The purpose of this fund is to invest in 11 markets in Asia and Latin America that display “favorable demographic, economic, and regulatory conditions coupled with a rapidly growing demand for private infrastructure investments.” The press release does not specify what the 11 countries are. We can make some educated guesses though. In June 2024, GIP announced that they would be joining a coalition focused on increasing investment (potentially as much as $25 billion over several years) into emerging markets that are members of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. This includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. GIP is being joined in this effort by other private equity heavy hitters like KKR, as well as big sovereign wealth funds from the region like Temasek and GIC. I don’t usually pay attention to press releases like this, because they tend to be drafted in such a vague way as to be meaningless. But GIP has wasted no time putting their money where their mouth is, pushing through the privatization of Malaysia Airports in partnership with Khazanah and EPF and in the process becoming a major shareholder in Malaysia’s entire national airport network. The deal was valued at around $4 billion. The pivot to Indo-Pacific infrastructure took an even bigger turn when it was announced in the last few days that a consortium including GIP and BlackRock were acquiring Hong Kong-based port operator Hutchinson Port Holdings for almost $23 billion. If not blocked by regulators, this deal will see the BlackRock-led group acquire total or partial ownership of 43 ports in 23 countries including Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, as well as along the Panama Canal. Hutchinson operates ports in China and Hong Kong which will not be part of the deal. It’s difficult not to interpret this blockbuster deal through a geopolitical lens. It’s clear at this point that China has been quicker on the draw than the United States in investing in critical infrastructure in regions like Southeast Asia. They’ve built or are building high-speed rail projects in Thailand and Indonesia, and have been willing to integrate countries in the region into clean energy value chains, investing in local production of things like batteries, EVs, solar panels and nickel. By comparison, American companies like Tesla have been slow to enter the Southeast Asian market and there’s been little indication Elon Musk wants to set up any significant manufacturing in the region. Meanwhile, Apple had to be browbeaten into making a modest amount of investment in exchange for being allowed to sell the latest iPhone in Indonesia. The obvious take-away is that the U.S. has little power to compel private companies like Apple or Tesla to expand their footprint in a region like Southeast Asia if they don’t want to, even if doing so might be beneficial to U.S. geopolitical interests. Which is why it’s interesting that we are suddenly seeing a flurry of private equity activity being funneled into critical infrastructure in and around Southeast Asia (and other parts of the world that have potential geostrategic value). Two years ago, GIP had fairly limited exposure in the Asia-Pacific region, especially Southeast Asia. Within the last year, the fund has become a major shareholder in Malaysia’s national airport network, and in one of Indonesia’s largest container terminals (assuming the Hutchinson deal goes through). And they seem keen on pursuing more opportunities in the region, especially related to digital infrastructure and data centers. Are these decisions being made purely on the basis of their commercial considerations, and the returns that BlackRock and GIP expect to generate by investing in energy, transportation and digital connectivity in a fast-growing region with ballooning demand for infrastructure? Or are there broader geopolitical considerations behind this pivot to the Indo-Pacific? I don’t know the answer. But it certainly seems like something worth keeping an eye on.

Title: Hong Kong, China hit out at sale of CK Hutchison ports to BlackRock

State-backed media says Lee Ka-shing's firm should 'think again,' and consider the Chinese national interest. By Dawn Yu for RFA Cantonese 2025.03.24 -- Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee has criticized the "bullying tactics by foreign governments" in the wake of the controversial US$23-billion sale of dozens of port facilities -- including those in the Panama Canal -- by homegrown conglomerate CK Hutchison to U.S. investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock and CK Hutchison, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Lee Ka-shing, announced earlier this month that they had reached an agreement in principle for BlackRock to acquire CK Hutchison's 90% interests in Panama Ports, which owns and operates the Panama terminals Balboa and Cristobal. BlackRock will also buy CK Hutchison's 80% controlling interest in a further 43 ports in 23 other countries, the companies said in a joint statement dated March 4. The sale came amid growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over key infrastructure on the Panama Canal and other port facilities in the Western hemisphere. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened Panamanian leader JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong on Tuesday, adding that Hong Kong would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law." "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," he told journalists at a regular briefing on Tuesday. The ruling Chinese Communist Party responded by sending a delegation to Panama led by Ma Hui, vice-minister of the Central Committee's International Department, state news agency Xinhua reported. "China is willing to strengthen exchanges with Panamanian political parties and think tanks, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and solidify public support for friendly relations between China and Panama," it quoted Ma as saying on March 17. The visit came as Communist Party-backed media criticized the CK Hutchison port sale, citing a "close personal relationship" between BlackRock and the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao newspaper said the Trump administration had "directly and blatantly intervened and manipulated the deal without scruple, using it as a way to promote their global hegemony." "Now that the Panama Canal has been Americanized and politicized, the United States will definitely be using it to promote its own political agenda," the paper said, citing "huge risks" for Chinese companies' shipping costs and supply chains. It said plans to charge Chinese ships bigger docking fees could affect China's shipping industry, foreign trade and President Xi Jinping's "Belt and Road" global supply chain, infrastructure and influence program. "This is power politics packaged as commercial behavior," the paper said in an editorial that was posted to the official website of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (in Chinese). It said accusations on social media that CK Hutchison had engaged in "spineless grovelling and profit-seeking while disregard the national interest" were "completely understandable." "The company concerned should think twice ... and think carefully about what side it's on," the paper said. Neither China's State Administration for Market Regulation nor the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council had responded to requests for comment by the time of publication. Financial analyst Simon Lee said Lee Ka-shing was caught between a rock and a hard place. "If he sells, he's done for. If he doesn't sell, he's done for," Lee said. "It seems that it's no longer possible to be just a business, whether in China or the United States." "Now you have to pick a side -- you can't just do business like you could before."

Title: Housing land dezoned in Dundalk despite regulator’s intervention
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/housing-planning/2025/03/25/housing-land-dezoned-in-dundalk-despite-regulators-intervention/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Councillors in Co Louth have voted to confirm the dezoning of residential land in Dundalk, potentially blocking hundreds of new homes in defiance of formal recommendations from the planning regulator. As the housing crisis worsens, the vote prompts questions as to whether Niall Cussen, the chief executive of the Office of the Planning Regulator, asks Minister for Housing James Browne to consider issuing a direction to the county council to revoke the dezoning of the lands at Haggardstown, Blackrock. Mr Cussen’s office provided no guidance on his likely course of action. “We decline to comment at this point in time,” it said. The “new residential” land owned by builder Glenveagh was previously earmarked for some 500 new homes when Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Green and Sinn Féin councillors voted at the beginning of the general election campaign in November to rezone it as “strategic reserve” land. The planning regulator intervened in January, telling Co Louth planners the recommendation to maintain residential zoning related to “clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions, of the national or regional policy framework and/or the policy of Government, as set out in the Ministerial guidelines”. The regulator noted Dundalk was classified as a regional growth centre and said up to 700 housing units could be built on the lands, adding that such homes “would lessen the pressure for development in other less sustainable areas”. In a report to councillors in February, council chief executive David Conway said he agreed with the regulator “that a residential zoning is appropriate”. At a meeting this month, 11 councillors voted to reject the chief executive’s recommendation to keep residential zoning and six were in favour. Another 11 councillors were absent from the vote and one abstained. The rejection of Mr Conway’s recommendation was, in effect, a vote to endorse the earlier vote to dezone the land. [ Nimbyism or valid objection: the fight over one Dundalk housing schemeOpens in new window ] The voting majority comprised four Fianna Fáil councillors, three from Fine Gael, three Independents and one Green. The vote came despite the Coalition led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael repeatedly citing the delivery of housing as its top policy priority in domestic politics. Those voting to keep the residential zoning included five Sinn Féin councillors, who reversed previous party support for dezoning the land. One Fianna Fáil councillor, John Sheridan, voted to keep residential zoning. The reasons cited in the council minute of the vote included the view that residential zoning on the lands “do not follow a sequential pattern of development”. The minute also said there were “deficiencies” in water services infrastructure in the area. Citing deficiencies in sewerage services in a June 2024 ruling, An Bord Pleanála refused Glenveagh permission for 502 homes on the lands. In his letter, however, Mr Cussen said his office recently consulted Uisce Éireann and understood the subject lands “while not currently serviced, can be serviced during the lifetime” of the 2024-2030 local area plan. The lands were also identified as “serviceable” in a capacity audit that informed the draft local area plan, the regulator said. Housing development would “directly benefit” from proposed bus routes, cycle networks and a greenway, he said. “Having regard to all of the above and also to the fact that there are no flooding concerns with respect to the subject lands, the office is strongly of the view that the new residential land use zoning objective should be retained as it represents compact, sequential, sustainable growth for the town of Dundalk.” Such plans aligned with the principles of the national planning framework, regional development strategies and the county development plan “particularly in relation to the delivery of housing at sustainable, serviceable locations”.

Title: Aoife Wafer’s ‘bring it on’ attitude a formidable force for Ireland

It’s Aoife Wafer’s birthday on Tuesday and it really is hard to credit that she’s only turning 22 given all she has already achieved. Ireland’s Player of the Tournament in last season’s Six Nations and, after scoring twice in the WXV1 win over New Zealand, was named in the World Dream Team at the 2024 World Rugby Awards in Monaco. “I didn’t even realise it was my birthday until after the game on Saturday,” said Wafer, referring to Ireland’s 27-15 loss to France in the opening game of this year’s Six Nations on Saturday. “I was so focused on France I completely forgot.” The squad will be preparing for their second game against Italy in Parma on Sunday (kick-off 3pm Irish) and having her birthday in the middle of the tournament restricts celebrations. But, recalling her 18th birthday three seasons ago, she said it has its benefits too, not least as she shares a birthday with squad captain Edel ‘Tricky’ McMahon. “Brian O’Driscoll had come in to present jerseys so we had an absolute selection of cakes and Tricky and I were celebrating away the night before the Wales game. It’s pretty cool to have a birthday in the middle of a campaign.” In her final game as a 21-year-old last Saturday, Wafer made the most carries (17) of any Irish player, won three turnovers, beat three defenders (joint most), scored two of Ireland’s three tries and made 11 tackles (second only to Niamh O’Dowd). And yet she was a marked woman. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand saying after the game: “You could see they were naming her”. As befits her style of play Wafer’s attitude is to ‘bring it on’, and even if her red headguard makes her a more identifiable target, which she partly wears to help her grandmother Cathy to pick her out, she has no intention of removing it. “If they want to put two, three, four people on me to try tackle me I’ve no problem putting a team-mate through a hole and letting them go over because it doesn’t matter who goes over, it doesn’t matter who makes the metres, as long as it’s a good thing for the team. “If the girls want me to run into three Frenchies I’ve no problem to put my head down and try to burst through a wall.” On being named by the opposition, she added: “To be honest I can’t even hear my mother when I’m playing down in Blackrock. I’m quite deaf as well, so I’m very bad at hearing stuff.” The Wexford woman made her Irish debut off the bench soon after her 18th birthday in a 29-8 win over Italy in the 2022 Six Nations at Musgrave Park, before a ruptured hamstring delayed her second cap for over 18 months. She was also part of the team that suffered a second successive defeat to the Azzurri last year. “Italy are a mixed bag. They have players who are absolutely outstanding. You look at (Beatrice) Rigoni, she’s a phenomenal rugby player, but they are beatable and last year that was a game that got away from us in the RDS. “It’s something that we fixed because you look at that Italy game and it got away from us. We had a lot of chances to put them away. We had most of the possession and most of the territory, but it was our own mistakes that let Italy into the game, whether that be we gave away a penalty [or] they kicked for the corner and mauled us over. That kind of thing. “But then you also look at the next result that we had after Italy, which was Wales, and we went out and pummelled Wales because we’re a group that learns fast and that is reflected in our honesty with each other. “I have played Italy twice and we obviously lost in the RDS last year but in my first cap we also won at a time which probably wasn’t the best for Irish women’s rugby but we got our result. “It will be interesting but I’m backing our girls.” ♦ Aoife Wafer has been unveiled as Energia’s newest brand ambassador, “further enhancing their commitment to powering the future of Irish rugby”.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China As Golden Ticket To Quietly Operate In Panama Canal
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/03/24/iran-allegedly-used-china-golden-ticket-quietly-operate-panama-canal/

China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the DCNF show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong, China, to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Dr. Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the DCNF. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies — Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping and Grandest Shipping — all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. (RELATED: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence) The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multi-million dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show.

(Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI / AFP) (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and Director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the DCNF. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade US sanctions.” The U.S.’s ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called “shadow fleets” that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard program on counterterrorism & intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the DCNF. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The BRI has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment giant Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the DCNF. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the DCNF. “So it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.
