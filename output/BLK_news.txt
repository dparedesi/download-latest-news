With the surname Letts, it’s not surprising that diaries, letters and memoir form a major part of the literary estate of WM Letts. What is surprising is that the life story and works of this poet, war poet, dramatist, novelist, essayist and children’s writer have been almost forgotten, despite the recent interest in neglected female authors. Winifred Mabel Letts (1882-1972) was the granddaughter of Thomas Letts of Letts Diaries, and of Alexander James Ferrier of Ferrier Pollock & Co, a wholesale textile and haberdashery company whose headquarters were at Powerscourt Town House, off Grafton Street. Her father was Rev Ernest Letts, rector of Newton Heath in Manchester, who also used to officiate as summer chaplain at Holy Trinity Church on the Herberts’ Muckross Estate in Kerry. Her mother was Mary Isabel Ferrier, of Knockmaroon, just outside the gates of the Phoenix Park. It was to Knockmaroon – “to Paradise” – that the family came on holidays each year, to escape from their “smoke-blackened and rather grim” Lancashire parish. At the age of 16, Letts moved from a boarding school in the English midlands to Alexandra College in Dublin, where she studied English language and literature, French language and literature, history, geography and drawing. Following the death of her father in 1904, the family moved from Newton Heath to Blackrock, Co Dublin. The open spaces of Ireland and the open nature of Irish people seem to have released her creative spirit and, for the next 60 years, newspapers, periodicals, publishers and broadcasters regularly featured Letts’s writings – poems, short stories, essays, children’s books, plays, reviews and, in the case of The Irish Times, her letters to the editor. Letts’s first visit to the Abbey Theatre – “a daring move” as the Abbey was regarded suspiciously by her own unionist Protestant circle – was to see Synge’s Riders to the Sea in January 1907. It inspired her to write and submit a play of her own, The Eyes of the Blind, which was accepted and first performed on Easter Monday, along with Yeats’ Deirdre and Lady Gregory’s Spreading the News and The Rising of the Moon. In October 1909, her play, The Challenge, was performed, and thus Letts, as well as being only the second female playwright to have a play performed in the Abbey, is one of the few women – to date – to have had more than one play performed there. Other plays and sketches were broadcast on radio and performed by amateur groups, and a three-act documentary play, Hamilton and Jones, was staged in the Gate Theatre in July 1941. [ What do Irish writers read? Donal Ryan, Mark Tighe, Nuala O’Connor, Claire Hennessy and more give recommendationsOpens in new window ] Letts said, when interviewed in 1969 by Maeve Binchy for The Irish Times’s Women First series, that she never heard anything “memorable or musical” in drawingroom conversation and that all her ideas came “from the back door”, from listening to the talk of people “who came to sell things or to deliver vegetables”. A conversation with a blackberry seller from Glencullen led to the poem, Thim that Thravels on their Feet, which was published in the Spectator in 1910. Letts was then asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing. Many of her best-known poems, including A Soft Day, Tim, An Irish Terrier, and The Bold Unbiddable Child, were published in her first collection of poetry, Songs from Leinster (1913). The two Stanford cycles, A Fire of Turf and A Sheaf of Songs from Leinster, were taken from this collection, and were performed as recently as March 2024 in the National Concert Hall as part of the Stanford Centenary Series. A second and third collection of lyrical poetry followed in 1926 and 1947. Letts was asked to write a cycle of poems which CV Stanford could set to music for Harry Plunket Greene to sing Letts’s work during the first World War as a nursing voluntary aid detachment in Manchester, followed by her training in Baggot Street Hospital as a masseuse (nowadays called a physiotherapist), resulted in her groundbreaking war poetry, published prior to the collections of Sassoon, Owen and Ledwidge. Her early war poems celebrated the young men going off to war, even though they leave their heartbroken families behind. But as the war progressed, Letts exposed the physical trauma, and the barely acknowledged problems of mental trauma, in poems such as To a Soldier in Hospital and What Reward? Her empathy with, and sympathy for, the young soldier who “could not face the German guns” in her poem, The Deserter, makes this one of the most moving of all war poems. The collections, Hallow-e’en and Poems of the War and The Spires of Oxford and Other Poems, were published in 1916 and 1917. As well as writing poetry and drama, essays and short stories, Letts wrote six children’s books (five of which were serialised and broadcast on radio), three books on religious themes, a memoir (Knockmaroon) and seven novels directed at an audience of young women experiencing the freedom brought about by education and employment opportunities. Her verses were used by Elizabeth C Yeats in her Cuala Press prints and cards. A copy of the Cuala Press print St Brigid, with verse by Letts, and illustrated by her stepdaughter, Kathleen Verschoyle, now hangs in Government Buildings. Letts continued her professional work as a masseuse up to the time of her marriage in 1926 to William HF Verschoyle, a widower 23 years older than her, who had lost two of his three sons in the first World War. Letts initially found it difficult to adapt to living in town, at 19 Fitzwilliam Square, but she loved her time on the Verschoyle farmlands in Kilberry, Co Kildare. She relished the company of her step-grandson, her great-nieces, her many godchildren, and the children of those who worked for them. Life was busy with her involvement in the Women Writers’ Club, PEN, Wild Flower Society, and many charities, including the Dublin Auxiliary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals (DSPCA), to whom she donated royalties and poems, when it was in financial difficulties. [ Sam Thompson: ‘I really don’t think there is a distinction to be made between writing for adults and writing for children’Opens in new window ] After the death of her husband, Letts moved to Kent in 1947 to live with her sisters. She returned permanently to Ireland in 1953, and bought the charming Beech Cottage on Ballinclea Road, Killiney. Fifty years after her death in 1972, President Michael D Higgins attended a ceremony in Rathcoole Church of Ireland marking the addition of her name to the Verschoyle headstone. In a 1957 interview in The Irish Times, Letts described herself as “a period piece, a has-been, totally unknown to this generation”. Two generations later, Letts is, at last, being recognised and remembered – as a groundbreaking poet, an innovative dramatist, an engaging novelist and a talented children’s author. Sing in the Quiet Places of my Heart, a biography of Letts by Bairbre O’Hogan, is published by South Dublin Libraries.

Title: GAA county final previews: Kilmacud-Crokes bidding for four-in-a-row in Dublin

Full Content:
Westmeath SFC final replay: St Loman’s v The Downs, TEG Cusack Park, 3.0 – There was nothing between them in the drawn match, a contest that went back and forth but Loman’s maybe have a little more room for improvement. Verdict: St Loman’s Leitrim SHC final: Carrick Hurling Club v Cluainín Iomáint, Drumshambo, 2.0. Armagh SFC final: Clann Éireann v Clan na Gael, Athletic Grounds, 4.15 – Clann Éireann beat champions Crossmaglen in the semi-final, as they did in the 2021 final when winning their most recent title. That recent pedigree makes them favourites with Armagh All-Ireland winners spread through the field from Barry McCambridge at the back to Conor Turbitt up front. Clan na Gael’s in-form Shane McPartlan and county super sub, Stefan Campbell will ensure it’s not easy but it’s hard to see an upset. Verdict: Clann Éireann Cavan SFC final: Crosserlough v Ramor United, Kingspan Breffini, 4.0 – Crosserlough have impressed on the way to the final, especially in the absence of injured star forward Paddy Lynch. An experienced Ramor will be formidable opponents and can spring a surprise. Verdict: Ramor United. Fermanagh SFC final: Enniskillen Gaels v Erne Gaels, Brewster Park, 2.0 – Former Donegal manager Declan Bonner is in charge of Erne Gaels’ quest for a first title in 43 years and they overcame champions and regular tormentors Derrygonnelly in the semi-final. Enniskillen, champions from two years ago, stand in the way. Verdict: Enniskillen Gaels Dublin SFC final: Cuala v Kilmacud Crokes, Parnell Park, 2.30 [Live, TG4] – Kilmacud, on the trail of a fourth straight title, are hot favourites against their southside neighbours, whose only previous final was in 1988. There have been slight signs of weariness in Crokes but in the past they have always perked up at the right time. Cuala may have the edge at centrefield with Peadar Ó Cofaigh Byrne and Cillian Dunne, brother of county women’s star Jennifer, in fine form. The Dalkey side are 100 per cent for the championship to date – Crokes drew along the way – and Con O’Callaghan has been a consistent menace. What may decide the outcome is the polished Kilmacud defence, which can restrict their opponents’ high-scoring attack and leave an attainable target for Paul Mannion and company at the other end. Verdict: Kilmacud Crokes London SFC final: St Kiernan’s v North London Shamrocks, Ruislip, 2.30. Louth SFC final: Naomh Mairtín v St Mary’s, Haggardstown, 3.30 – St Mary’s are on three-in-a-row and face the team they beat in last year’s final. Despite some indifferent form along the way, they can keep the title in Ardee. Verdict: St Mary’s Longford SFC final replay: Abbeylara v Colmcille, Glennon Brothers Pearse Park, 4.0 – Abbeylara may have missed their chance last week against the experienced former champions. Verdict: Colmcille Mayo SFC final: Ballina Stephenites v Knockmore – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that has been issued for Mayo. Game will now be played next Saturday, October 26th. Meath SFC final: Dunshaughlin v Wolfe Tones, Páirc Tailteann, 3.0 – A clash between the experience of Wolfe Tones and a rising Dunshaughlin, just a couple of seasons out of intermediate. Managed by Richie Kealy and coached by former Dublin All-Ireland winner Paul Curran, who has returned to his Dunshaughlin roots, the club his father Noel played for when winning an All-Ireland with Meath in 1967. Verdict: Dunshaughlin Roscommon SFC final: Pádraig Pearses v Roscommon Gaels, Dr Hyde Park, 2.0 – Pearses caused a big shock when eliminating St Brigid’s, the Connacht champions, who were unlucky not to win last season’s All-Ireland. Former provincial winners themselves, they are unlikely to let it slip against an emerging but still callow Gaels team. Verdict: Pádraig Pearses Tipperary SFC final: Clonmel Commercials v Loughmore-Castleiney, Semple Stadium, 4.0 – The great dual story of Loughmore continues and both their form in walloping the fancied Moyle Rovers and their momentum as hurling champions gives them a great chance against the formidable Commercials, who are on a three-in-a-row. Verdict: Loughmore-Castleiney Tyrone SFC final: Errigal Ciarán v Trillick, Healy Park, 4.0 – Trillick came out winners in this same fixture a year ago after a thrilling final in which they deposed the then champions. There’s not much in it again but spurred by last year’s reverse, Errigal Ciarán can settle accounts with the champions. Verdict: Errigal Ciarán Waterford SFC final: Ballinacourty v Rathgormack, Fraher Field Dungarvan, 3.0 – Rathgormack annihilated The Nire in the semi-final and are well fancied not to relent in the final against Ballinacourty who will be sterner opponents after a narrow win over Gaultier. Verdict: Rathgormack Wicklow SFC final: Baltinglass v Tinahely, Aughrim, 2.0 – Precedent is against Tinahely, who lost their more recent final to this weekend’s opponents four years ago and were also beaten when the teams met earlier in this season’s championship. Verdict: Baltinglass Antrim SHC final: Dunloy v Ruairi Óg Cushendall, Ballycastle, 2.0 – Conal Cunning’s injury is a major blow for Dunloy, who had an impressive semi-final win over Loughgiel and were on course to reclaim the Antrim title. It’s more complicated now. Verdict: Cushendall Clare SHC final: Sixmilebridge v Feakle – Postponed due to the Met Éireann status orange wind warning that was issued for Clare on Saturday. Game provisionally scheduled for bank holiday Monday, October 28th. Cork SHC final: Imokilly v Sarsfields, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, TG4, 4.15 – A tight, tight extra-time win for Sarsfields was the outcome when the teams met in last year’s semi-final, which should ostensibly give a motivational edge to Imokilly against the champions who again had a tough semi-final this time against Midleton and did well to survive. That may have renewed them for the final after an undemanding earlier season whereas Imokilly were comfortable winners against Blackrock. Séamus Harnedy has maintained his strong Cork form for the challengers as has Ciarán Joyce. Verdict: Imokilly Derry SHC final: Slaughtneil v Banagher, Owenbeg, 4.0 – Banagher approach with hopes high but it’s hard to argue with a team looking for a 12th successive title. Verdict: Slaughtneil Down SHC final: Ballygalget v St Patrick’s, Páirc Esler, 4.0. Offaly SHC final: Ballinamere v Kilcormac-Kiloughey, Glenisk O’Connor Park, 3.45 – Contrasting finalists, as Ballinamere have reached this stage for the first time in more than 100 years whereas their opponents have won five titles in the past 12 years. Defending champions Kilcormac have been in exceptional form this season and even though Ballinamere are clearly on the rise, the breakthrough may have to wait. Verdict: Kilcormac-Killoughey Sligo SHC final: Easkey v Naomh Eoin, Markievicz Park, 2.0 Seán Moran is GAA Correspondent of The Irish Times Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Des Cahill having the time of his life as Cuala’s footballers finally get their day in the sun

Cuala are in the Dublin football final for only the second time in their history, so what do you do? You get on to Des Cahill. And you ask Des Cahill who in Cuala should you be talking to about the club’s football story. You’d like, if possible, to hear from somebody who was around for all the bad times. A person who, while being delighted for the hurlers throughout their All-Ireland-winning success in the late-2010s, still flew the flag for the football side of the house. A Cuala big ball lifer. Des Cahill thinks about it for half an hour and replies by suggesting ... Des Cahill. “In terms of this team ... that’s probably me!” reads the WhatsApp reply. “I was with them since we won the Under-21 title 14 years ago until 2 years ago. Ironically the Under 21 win – against the odds – was against Crokes ... on my 50th birthday. A day of days!” And so here we are, a few afternoons later, walking down through the village of Glasthule with red and white flags hanging from every lamp-post. Keep going and you’ll arrive on to Main Street in Dalkey, where it’s impossible to go 10 yards without seeing some sign of the county final. This part of Dublin’s southside knows plenty about success in rugby and in hurling too. But a county football final? Not in this neighbourhood. “The joy of it is brilliant,” Cahill says. “We’re probably getting more joy out of it than most teams, I’d imagine. People say, ‘Oh Cuala, sure you won two All-Irelands’. Fantastic. And it really was, everyone was so happy for the hurlers. But for the likes of me now, this justifies years and years of sticking at it.” Cuala is a flipside club in Dublin. In most cases, being a dual club means one of two realities – you’re either stubbornly 50/50 or you’re a football club with a hurling section fighting its corner. In Cuala, it’s always been the other way around. Not outwardly, not officially – but everyone knows what’s what. Cahill tells a story about Vinny Holden, brother of Mick, son of Cuala founding father Tommy. Holden hurled for Dublin for 20 years and was a mainstay of the first Cuala teams to win senior Dublin titles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Spin the tape on and he and Cahill were in cahoots the day after the minor footballers won their first county championship in 2006. [ ‘We’re a long time on the road’: Michael Fitzsimons ready to tick senior club title off the list with CualaOpens in new window ] “Mick Fitzsimons was in that group,” Cahill remembers. “But you had Paul Schutte there, David Treacy, Oisin Gough – all those lads who went on to hurl for Dublin. We beat Vincent’s in the final and we were elated. For us owl’ lads, beating Vincent’s was huge. The young lads didn’t think that was a big deal but it was for us. “Anyway, we were all out after it and it went late and sure then we all had to ring home to explain where we were. And Vinnie rang his wife Marion and went, ‘Marion, you know the minor hurlers? They’re after winning the football championship!’ “They weren’t even called the minor footballers. So that sort of sums up Cuala for me, when people ask are we a hurling club or a football club.” Over the past four decades, Cahill has been the club’s best known member, give or take Con O’Callaghan. When Cuala reached their only Dublin football final away back in July 1988, he was out of the country on a summer-long work adventure that took in Euro 88, the Tour de France and the Seoul Olympics. He has waited 36 years for them to get back here. [ My Club: Des Cahill on Cuala Opens in new window ] For long stretches of Cuala’s footballing life, they have lived in the shadow of bigger concerns. That goes for their own club, where hurling has reigned. But it goes too for the schoolyard world of southside Dublin GAA, where Kilmacud Crokes have always been the biggest boys in the flashiest kits. “We would have resented Kilmacud years ago for being the big ogres and us being the small guys,” Cahill says. “We had a fellah, John O’Callaghan, who was a sub on the Dublin 1995 team that beat Tyrone to win the All-Ireland. He’s a great lad. “But Dublin said to him, ‘You can’t be playing intermediate, you need to be playing senior’. And he came to us and said, ‘Lads, do you mind if I go to Kilmacud?’ And we were going, ‘Eh, obviously!’ But we were only messing – no one minded because he was a great lad and you were happy to see him do well. But that’s who we were, basically.” As time went on and the GAA took more of a hold around the area, Cuala were never short of talent and certainly haven’t struggled for numbers. Eventually, that translated into an unprecedented level of hurling success. Five Dublin titles in six seasons between 2015 and 2020. Back-to-back Leinster and All-Ireland champions. A golden time. In a way, it all started in 2009. The backbone of those teams came from the side that won the under-21 hurling championship in Dublin 15 years ago. What got lost along the way though is the fact Cuala did the under-21 double in 2009 and that a huge chunk of them were on the football team as well. “That under-21 final was the start of this team,” Cahill says. “The final was just before Christmas and we beat Kilmacud against the odds. On the back of that, we had a lot of promise going forward. But the hurling took over. “I’m convinced, with the talent on that team, that we could have had great success in football. The lads on that team were really good underage footballers. Paul Schutte was at least two years as a Dublin minor footballer as a full-forward. Oisín Gough and the Treacys were good underage footballers. “But Anthony Daly took them in straight away and didn’t want them playing football. We won the Dublin intermediate championship one year and we were going into Leinster. But they were going in training with Dublin in November. And I’m friends with Daly and I was going, ‘Dalo, come on’. But he was trying to make his mark as well and he was just going, ‘Des, they have to put in the work now to be ready for next summer’. “So I lost out there. They went for Dublin, which was fair enough. We had seven in the Dublin squad at one stage. Then Matty [Kenny] came along as senior hurling manager in the club. And Matty was going, ‘This group has huge potential’. The first year or two, we didn’t do anything in the hurling. But he said, ‘You cannot be hurling only every second week. You’ve no chance’. “And he was a very good salesman to the lads. He said: ‘You have to hurl every week if you’re going to do anything in the championship’. And he did that – and he was right! I thought at the time that we could win the football and the hurling in Dublin but he was right and I was wrong. We wouldn’t have won an All-Ireland in hurling if the lads had all played football as well.” If it was anything, it was a first-world problem. Cuala were winning All-Irelands in hurling and the name of the club was going far and wide. The footballers chipped away with what they had – and when Con O’Callaghan came along, what they had was enough to keep them in or around the top ranks. Peadar Ó Cofaigh-Byrne arrived, big and broad and taking no nonsense from anyone. Plenty more as well. “We had James Power, who was a very good rugby player. He’s the oldest by a long way. Him and Mick Fitz and Luke Keating have been there all the way. Power is 37 or so now, he’s kind of a posh boy, you know? A good Blackrock boy. “He called the referee ‘Sir’ once! And everyone, including the referee, thought he was taking the piss. The opposition were laughing. But no one messes with him. He’s also the most physical player we have, he’s our toughest, hardest player as well. But yeah, he called the referee ‘Sir’ in a game and Jesus Christ the ref turned against us completely. “For the likes of him and Luke Keating, this is so great. Luke would have made those hurling teams but he chose to stay with the football. And I felt so guilty. For those lads to be in a county final now, it’s great. It’s just brilliant.” Cuala will travel across Dublin Bay in style, naturally. They will march through the village en masse on Sunday afternoon and climb aboard the DART they’ve hired for the occasion. It will leave Dalkey station and go directly to Killester – very pointedly not stopping in Blackrock or Seapoint or any of the other necklace of stations from which rogue Kilmacud Crokes might sneak aboard. Then they will march on Parnell Park, a football day of days finally upon them. And though they are underdogs and though they face a Crokes team going for four-in-a-row, they won’t be put off by the odds being stacked against them. Why would they? It’s all they know. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Gold tops $2,700 for first time to extend record-breaking run
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/gold-price-2700-first-time-record-rally-mideast-us-election/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T22:23:19Z

Gold topped $2,700 an ounce for the first time as concerns over escalating conflicts in the Middle East and a tight US election race prompt investors to flock to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 1% to $2,720.17 an ounce, beating the all-time high set in the previous session. The bullish sentiment spilled over to the wider precious metals complex, with silver jumping as much as 5.5% to the highest since 2012. BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Silver Trust, the largest exchange-traded product tracking the metal, saw a large increase of call options as investors bet on higher prices. Markets are focused on increasingly fraught geopolitical developments after Israel said it killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Palestinian group’s attack on southern Israel that triggered a yearlong war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would keep fighting until all the hostages captured by Hamas last year are free, even as US President Joe Biden said it was time for the war to end. Investors typically seek safety in gold in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Investors were also repositioning portfolios ahead of the US election on Nov. 5. “Traditional polls and decentralized betting polls have diverged significantly, even as we get closer to elections,” said Christopher Wong, FX strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “Trump hedges — long gold — may still gather traction given the fluidity of election developments and geopolitical uncertainties.” Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%, snapping a four-day rally. A weaker greenback makes bullion cheaper for many buyers, as it is priced in the US currency. Gold is about 2.4% higher for the week, with haven demand outweighing other macro headwinds that would normally weigh on the precious metal after US reports on Thursday diminished bets on the scale of Federal Reserve easing. Bullion is one of 2024’s strongest performing commodities, with gains of more than 30% so far this year. Rate-cut optimism fueled the most recent gains as the Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month. Robust central bank buying has also been a long-standing pillar of support for gold prices.

The US central bank’s pivot to looser monetary policy has bolstered the appeal of exchange-traded funds backed by bullion, with holdings on course for a fifth monthly expansion in October — the longest run of inflows since 2020. For many in the industry, the outlook from here is even more bullish. Traders, refiners and miners who attended the London Bullion Market Association’s annual gathering this week saw prices rising to about $2,917 an ounce by late October 2025, according to the average forecast from a survey of delegates. Silver will gain more than 40% in the coming year to reach $45 an ounce, according to the survey. Spot gold was trading at $2,718.72 an ounce as of 2:36 p.m. in New York.

Title: US SEC gives green light for options listing for spot bitcoin ETFs to NYSE

(Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to 11 exchange-traded funds to list and trade options tied to spot bitcoin prices on the New York Stock Exchange, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

Title: BlackRock eyes crypto derivatives market with BUIDL as collateral

The move could boost significantly the nearly $550 million market cap presented by BUIDL, the largest tokenized US treasuries fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is reportedly in discussions with several centralized exchanges to allow its BUIDL fund to be used as collateral for derivatives trades As reported by Bloomberg on Oct. 18, people familiar with the matter shared that the move includes exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Deribit. This move is part of a broader push by Wall Street firms to deepen their involvement in the digital asset markets. BlackRock’s BUIDL token requires a minimum investment of $5 million and is specifically designed for qualified institutional investors. FalconX and Hidden Road, two major crypto prime brokers, already permit their hedge fund clients to use BUIDL as collateral, while custodian Komainu recently announced its clients would be able to trade via Hidden Road using the token as collateral. Direct acceptance of BUIDL on platforms like Binance and Deribit would significantly increase its market reach. The crypto derivatives market moved nearly $3.5 trillion in September, which is almost four times larger than the spot market, according to data from Coinglass and The Block. While BlackRock has yet to comment on the initiative, Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers acknowledged that the exchange is considering various tokens, including BUIDL. However, Strijers stressed the need for regulatory approvals and a deeper understanding of the token’s technical aspects before moving forward. The report of the world’s largest asset manager moving deeper into crypto coincides with another report about a crypto-native company delving into traditional finance. Tether Limited, the issuer of the Tether USD (USDT) stablecoin, is reportedly considering offering lending to commodities trading companies. The move is a possible alternative the crypto firm found to leverage its $5.2 billion profit registered in the first half. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are already considering using BUIDL tokenized shares in financial instruments. On Aug. 26, leading money market platform Aave proposed a new GHO Stability Module (GSM) based on BlackRock’s tokenized fund. GSM is a mechanism created by Aave to help maintain the peg of its ecosystem’s stablecoin, GHO. When users swap USD Coin (USDC) for GHO, the novel module would allow the exchange of USDC for BUIDL. According to the proposal, this would help GHO’s stability while providing value accrual to users through BlackRock’s offered yield. Moreover, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed a new stablecoin fully backed by BUIDL on Sept. 26. The UStb would offer an alternative to Ethena’s USDe, appealing to users with a more conservative appetite for risk.

Cohen, who heads up the asset manager's exchange-traded funds and index investments as chief investment officer, told CNBC that BlackRock now sees the demand was for a better way to access bitcoin. "It was for the ETF wrapper," she told CNBC on stage at the Permissionless Conference in Utah. The total market cap of all eleven spot bitcoin ETFs now tops $63 billion, with total flows of nearly $20 billion. In the last five trading days alone, spot bitcoin ETFs have seen net inflows of more than $2.1 billion, with BlackRock accounting for half of those sales. The spike in trading volume comes as bitcoin hit its highest level since July this week, trading above $68,300. Bitcoin ended the third quarter up around 140% from the same quarter a year ago, outpacing the S&P 500, as these spot token funds and the crypto market cap move higher in lock-step. Crypto-aligned stock Coinbase closed up about 24% this week, its best week since February. Cohen told CNBC that part of the strategy for attracting customers to its funds was teaching crypto investors about the benefits of exchange-traded products (ETPs). 13F filings, which offer quarterly reads on equity positions taken by large investors, show that 80% of the buyers of these new spot bitcoin products in the U.S. are direct investors. Of the 80% of direct investors, Cohen told CNBC that 75% had never before owned an iShare, one of the best-known and largest ETF providers on the planet. "So we went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," said Cohen. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper." Before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission green-lit spot bitcoin funds in January, investors had a few ways to buy and custody cryptocurrencies. A centralized exchange like Coinbase was among the most user-friendly options for U.S investors. But the blockbuster debut of bitcoin ETPs has laid bare to Cohen and others across Wall Street, that crypto exchanges weren't giving digital asset investors everything they needed. It helps that the U.S. is a huge market for digital assets. New data from Chainalysis shows that North America remains the biggest crypto market globally, accounting for nearly 23% of all crypto trading volume. The blockchain analytics platform estimates that between July 2023 and July 2024, there was $1.3 trillion in on-chain value received. Venture firm a16z found in its recently released State of Crypto report that more than 40 million Americans hold crypto. So far, adoption has mostly been through wealth management clients asking advisors to add new spot crypto products to their portfolio. In August, Morgan Stanley was the first big bank to allow its 15,000 financial advisors to pitch bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity to clients with a net worth over $1.5 million. Other firms are still performing in-house due diligence before allowing their armies of FAs to start actively pitching the funds. "Wealth manager allocators have not been allocating," VanEck CEO Jan van Eck told CNBC in Utah. "I mean, they're barely even warming up." Van Eck drew parallels to the European market, where the company has 12 token-based products trading in Europe. "It's exactly what we see in Europe," he said. "Very few private banks have really approved investment in bitcoin or ethereum or anything else in a major way." Van Eck said his company has about $2 billion in its European crypto ETPs, and that a lot of the volume is from individual investors. Wall Street needs rules from lawmakers on Capitol Hill before it gets more comfortable with crypto. Cohen thinks that in a lot of ways, ETFs and blockchain technology are solving for similar things. "ETFs have been a decentralizing force in TradFi markets that have brought a lot more access and transparency, and importantly, really accelerated in growth during the post crisis 2008, 2009 period," said Cohen, referring to traditional finance markets. "I find it incredibly meaningful to look at the fact that the bitcoin whitepaper was published on October 31, 2008, and then you have the G20 leaders from around the world meeting to discuss the aftermath of the financial crisis and how do you create more transparency through public reporting," Cohen continued. BlackRock took on less risk by using counterparty clearing and multilateral trading. In TradFi markets, those moves created huge tailwinds for ETFs. "Then at the same time, DeFi is becoming a reality over the intervening 15 years," she said. "Was this a win for Bitcoin? Was this a win for ETPs? To me, the answer is: It's a win for investors, to the extent we can effectively marry these ecosystems which are solving for the same goals." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: BlackRock to integrate BUIDL fund as collateral for Binance, OKX, and Deribit

Time Published: 2024-10-18T17:15:13Z

Share this article BlackRock is advancing into the crypto derivatives market by integrating its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, as collateral for crypto trades, according to a report by Bloomberg. The asset management giant is in discussions with major crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Deribit, aiming to expand BUIDL’s use in derivatives. Already accepted by prime brokers FalconX and Hidden Road, BUIDL’s adoption could challenge dominant stablecoins like USDT and USDC in collateral markets. With a minimum investment of $5 million, BlackRock’s BUIDL token is designed for institutional investors. By having it accepted as collateral, BlackRock aims to provide a highly liquid and secure alternative for derivatives traders. This could shake up the current dominance of USDT, which holds a market value of $120 billion and is the most commonly used collateral in crypto derivatives. BlackRock launched its BUIDL token in March 2024 as part of its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is a blockchain-based representation of a traditional money-market fund that invests in assets like US Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. BUIDL distinguishes itself from other stablecoins by offering interest to holders, making it an attractive option for institutional investors seeking both yield and security. If exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Deribit integrate BUIDL, the token could become a standard for institutional collateral, providing a regulated, yield-bearing alternative to existing stablecoins. In addition to its focus on BUIDL, BlackRock has been actively leading the Bitcoin ETF space. Since the start of October alone, BlackRock has acquired over $2.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, accounting for 8% of their total Bitcoin holdings. BlackRock’s leadership in acquiring Bitcoin spot ETFs is set to expand their influence across both spot and derivatives markets. The integration of BUIDL as collateral for derivatives trades could complement their Bitcoin strategy, allowing for a diversified presence across crypto markets.

Title: ‘I really enjoy the journey of it all’: Lacken lad Caelan Doris would make ideal Lions king
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/18/i-really-enjoy-the-journey-of-it-all-lacken-lad-caelan-doris-would-make-ideal-lions-king/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:42:34Z

It will be another six months before Andy Farrell finally has to choose his British & Irish Lions captain for the 2025 expedition to Australia. Plenty of time for the landscape to change and, theoretically, for one or two surprise contenders to emerge from the shrubbery. Until, that is, you sit down with the staggeringly impressive Caelan Doris and realise there is little need for Farrell to look anywhere else. A bold prediction? Hardly. It is not rocket science that a world-class player with the universal respect of his peers, a university degree in psychology and a warm smile might just fit the bill. Ireland have produced some illustrious Lions captains in the pro era, from Brian O’Driscoll to Paul O’Connell and Peter O’Mahony, and another top-drawer candidate lurks quietly in the wings. Because whether or not he is confirmed, as most anticipate, on Wednesday as Ireland’s skipper for the upcoming November Tests, the 26-year-old Leinster back-rower is every coach’s dream. Even on a damp Tuesday morning he is already eyeing the next big challenge, batteries recharged and eyes gleaming after last Saturday’s win over Munster in front of 80,468 spectators at Croke Park. “You just kind of get into the zone. I don’t think I’m crazy aggressive; I’d say I’m relatively consistent on and off the pitch. But of course you’re competitive and want to play on the edge and win.” Alongside the footwork, physicality and footballing nous that make him such an effective number eight, however, Doris is no ordinary jock. The son of two psychoanalysts – his maternal grandfather Michael Sweetman was a prominent industrialist and political figure who tragically died in the Staines air crash in 1972 – he might have pursued a very different career. Or maybe not, given what he found when he returned to his native Co Mayo this summer. “I was back home in June, flicking through some old stuff, and found a book I’d made when I was making my Holy Communion at the age of 10 or 11. It had a page for future ambitions and where I wanted to live. On it was written, ‘I want to be a rugby or a football player’. That was kind of cool because I don’t remember that being something I was going after.” The follow-up entry – “I want to have a house in Mayo, London and New York” – also prompted some amusement. “I’ll be a while playing rugby if I want to do that.” To understand the real Doris, even so, you need to understand Lacken, where he grew up. The post office and the shop were sad casualties of Covid but the area remains close to his heart. “It’s beautiful. On a good day it’s hard to beat. My parents are still based there and I get back when I can. “It’s very rural ... I think there’s about 500 people in the parish. It’s about 10 minutes to the closest village and 20 minutes to the closest town. At my primary school, which was walking distance from where I grew up, there were 30 to 35 pupils in the whole school across eight years. In my year, I only had one other classmate.” Fortunately he and his solitary companion, David, became good friends but the 12-year-old Doris subsequently leapt at the chance to board at Blackrock College. Perhaps his genes would have propelled him into the national squad anyway but he thinks otherwise. “I’m more of a nurture over nature guy. Of course there’s a genetic element of it but I’d have had a rugby ball or a Gaelic football in hand from a very early age. We had a pretty big garden and lived by a school with a pitch so there was always something going on. Then you go to Blackrock, which is a massive rugby school. I loved it from the start.” He has been on a steep upward trajectory ever since. The 6ft 4in forward captained Ireland under-20s in 2018, made his Leinster debut in the same year and won the first of his 44 senior Ireland caps in 2020 under the captaincy of Johnny Sexton, whom he’d grown up admiring from afar. “It was strange initially. There was a bit of impostor syndrome: ‘What the hell am I doing in the same dressingroom as this guy?’” [ How to overcome impostor syndrome: ‘It affects high achievers who feel unworthy’Opens in new window ] Now, suddenly, Sexton has retired and Doris, who was in Cardiff this week to promote this year’s Investec Champions Cup, is fast becoming a similar talisman for Leinster and Ireland. He led the national side for the first time against Italy in February and was appointed Leinster’s captain last month. The mental side of the game – “It’s definitely an area I’m interested in ….” – fascinates him, as does the potential for captaincy to enhance his growth as a player and a person. “I want to get the best out of myself from a playing and a human perspective. If there’s extra responsibility ... it allows you to increase your capacity.” This includes his inner self. “Anything from being more open with friends and family or getting things off my chest or sharing something with someone. I do weekly therapy sessions and mindfulness to fill up the tank.” Sea swimming and saunas are other regular pastimes. “I’ve also started doing a bit of hot yoga recently, which I’ve enjoyed. It all just gives you a bit of balance and calm.” He will need plenty of both if a high-profile Lions role does come. As a kid, Doris remembers accompanying his father, Chris, to a local village pub at breakfast time to cheer on the Lions in 2005 and 2009 and Australia 2025 has long been on his bucket list. “It’s a pretty special thing isn’t it? It’s definitely a goal. There’s a lot of rugby to be played before then for Leinster and Ireland. But, yeah, I would absolutely love to be on the tour.” Before that, of course, comes next month’s looming reunion with the All Blacks, the first meeting of the sides since last year’s fateful World Cup quarter-final. That anniversary fell this week but Doris is more focused on embracing the next phase of his career. “Of course there are hard days, but there are so many good ones as well,” he said. “I really enjoy the journey of it all: the craic with the lads, the friendships, the travel, the opportunities. I’m trying to soak it all in.” The country boy from Lacken would make a cracking Lion king. – Guardian © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Will This Bull Market Ever End? – September Dividend Income Report
URL: https://thedividendguyblog.com/will-this-bull-market-ever-end/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T14:41:34Z
Full Content:
The Dividend Guy Blog Unconventional Lifestyle and Dividend Growth Strategy Blog, Dividend Income Report / October 18, 2024 by DivGuy / Leave a Comment In 2016, I made a life-changing decision: I took a sabbatical, put my family in a small RV, and drove to Costa Rica. Upon my return in 2017, I officially quit my job as a private banker at National Bank and started working full-time on my baby: Dividend Stocks Rock. I also decided to manage my pension account held at the National Bank. I’ve built this portfolio publicly since 2017 to make a real-life case study. I decided to invest 100% of this money in dividend growth stocks. In August 2017, I received $108,760.02 in a locked retirement account. This means I can’t add capital to the account, and growth is only generated through capital gains and dividends. I don’t report this portfolio’s results to brag about my returns or to tell you to follow my lead. I just want to share how I manage my portfolio monthly with all the good and the bad. I hope you can learn from my experience. Last month, I covered why BCE is dead to me. This time, let’s also look at our never-ending bull market and what could happen next. Let’s start with the numbers as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Original amount invested in September 2017 (no additional capital added): $108,760.02. Total return since inception (Sep 2017 – October 2024): 160.33% Annualized return (since September 2017 – 84 months): 14.65% SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 14.53% (total return 158.50%) iShares S&P/TSX 60 ETF (XIU.TO) annualized return (since Sept 2017): 10.42% (total return 100.10%) It seems that each time I review my portfolio, I cross a new all-time high. On one side, I’m glad I’m always 100% invested as I fully benefit from the bull markets. On the other hand, I can’t help but raise an eyebrow when I look at the current state of the market. This will not change my strategy, but I seriously think we are due for a market correction. Having said that, I would still invest all my money in the stock market if I had received my pension account last summer instead of doing it seven years ago. In the end, it doesn’t matter what I think will happen in the market in the next 12 months, as time in the market is more important than timing the market. Now, the S&P 500 is up by more than 20% since the beginning of the year, and the TSX is not far behind at +16% (including dividends). When investors ask if it’s time to invest in the stock market because interest rates are finally going down this year, I answer that the market started banking this information 12 months ago. This is what I was telling you in this monthly report back in November 2023. On the U.S. side, I was surprised that the utility sector surged more than all the others (+31.56% so far this year). The communication sector, led by tech giants Alphabet and Meta, is second, while the financial industry closes the top 3 best-performing sectors using SPDR spiders ETFs. Of course, this is not perfect, as ETFs can play around with stock allocation for each sector, but it gives a good idea of what is going on. You won’t be surprised to find the consumer discretionary sector last, offering a return of about half of the S&P 500 (around 10%). It seems it’s the only sector warning us that a recession could happen as many companies struggle to report sales and profit growth, claiming customers are stuck with tight budgets. When I look at the BMO ETFs tracking a mix of Canadian and U.S. stocks, I come to a similar conclusion about the consumer discretionary sector. It’s a tough ride if you are exposed to this sector. Still, everything is in positive territory with a strong rebound from the energy sector leading the pack with communications (BMO includes Alphabet and Meta in their ETF too). Despite concerns about the economy, Canadian Banks are doing quite well! Even ScotiaBank is performing well in 2024! If you are looking for “undervalued” stocks, the best sectors seem to be consumer discretionary and REITs (potentially utilities in Canada, too). Those sectors have taken a good hit since the rise in interest rates, and the recovery is not complete for many companies. Investing during all-time highs is always tricky as we fear a market crash. However, focusing on quality (read strong financial fundamentals) will always be a winning strategy. And let’s be honest, it’s a lot easier to select quality companies than predict where the market may be in 6 months! Should you want to add some stocks to your portfolio, I have shared my Top Underrated Dividend Growers on my YouTube channel. It includes my analysis of LeMaitre Vascular (LMAT), one of my holdings. Watch it below: Slowly but surely, the portfolio is taking shape with 11 companies spread across 7 sectors. My goal is to build a portfolio generating 4-5% in yield across 15 positions. I will continue to add new stocks monthly until I reach that goal. My current yield is 4.47%. I used my $500 contribution to buy more Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.TO). The stock has dropped about 20% from its peak value due to the weakness in oil prices. That’s a good time to buy more of what always works! I’ve covered CNQ’s recent drop in this podcast episode: I will likely sell my shares of CWB in the coming months since the play worked out perfectly, and I can move my money into another stock and it will help reduce my exposure to the financial sector. Here’s my SM portfolio as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): Let’s look at my CDN portfolio. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$2,777.13 (+2.54%) since September’s income report. We are at the end of a quarter and I’ll start reviewing U.S. companies’ earnings in my next portfolio update. Here’s my US portfolio now. Numbers are as of October 3rd 2024 (before the bell): My account shows a variation of +$5,894.06 (+4.89%) since September’s income report. Each quarter we run an exclusive report for Dividend Stocks Rock (DSR) members who subscribe to our very special additional service called DSR PRO. The PRO report includes a summary of each company’s earnings report for the period. We have been doing this for an entire year now and I wanted to share my own DSR PRO report for this portfolio. You can download the full PDF showing all the information about all my holdings. Results have been updated as of October 4th, 2024. Download my portfolio Q3 2024 report. It’s great to see a steady dividend increase over the past few months. I’ve performed a few transactions over the past 18 months such as selling Enbridge and Magna International, and my portfolio still pays more dividends now than ever. It’s great that most of my holdings have increased their dividends in the mid to high single-digits! It’s a great sign that my portfolio is healthy. Dividend growth (over the past 12 months): Canadian Holding payouts: $393.46 CAD. U.S. Holding payouts: $228.10 USD. Total payouts: $702.22 CAD. *I used a USD/CAD conversion rate of 1.3536 Since I started this portfolio in September 2017, I have received a total of $27,912.93 CAD in dividends. Keep in mind that this is a “pure dividend growth portfolio,” as no capital can be added to this account other than retained and/or reinvested dividends. Therefore, all dividend growth is coming from the stocks and not from any additional capital being added to the account. You may have noticed that I hold over $1,000 in cash across my US and Canadian accounts. This liquidity will soon be used to increase my position in Toromont Industries (TIH.TO) since it’s my smallest holding. I haven’t moved yet because I’ve been busy with other stuff! I don’t expect to make any other trades by the end of the year unless one of my top holdings breaks the 10% barrier of all my portfolios (hello, Apple!). Cheers, Mike.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs break $20 billion in inflows as BTC aims ATH
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-break-20-billion-in-inflows-as-btc-aims-ath/
Time Published: 2024-10-18T12:30:17Z

BTC ETFs achieve record inflows in months, a feat that took Gold ETFs years to achieve. Spot Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to shatter records and defy expectations. In a remarkable development, cumulative total net inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded the $20 billion mark for the first time since its launch in January. This record level was achieved following a massive influx of $1.5 billion in just four days. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted the significance of this milestone on X (formerly Twitter). He stated, “The most imp number, most difficult metric to grow in ETF world.” He further compared it to gold ETFs, noting that: “It took gold ETFs about 5yrs to reach same number.” It is worth noting that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been a major contributor to these inflows. Data reported by SoSo Value revealed that on the 17th of October, BTC Spot ETFs saw a total net inflow of $470 million. Out of which, IBIT led the way with an impressive $309 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ETF ARKB followed with a net inflow of $100 million. Source: SoSo Value As a result of these inflows, the total assets in spot Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $64 billion. On the 16th of October, IBIT experienced a substantial net inflow of $393.4 million, marking its largest inflow since July. At press time, BlackRock’s net assets stood at over $25 billion. The product accounted for 1.95% of the entire Bitcoin market share of $1.3 trillion. The surge in spot Bitcoin ETFs wasn’t the only bright spot this week. The cryptocurrency market has brought the long-awaited ‘Uptober’ rally to life. After briefly dipping to around $58,000 on the 10th of October, BTC skyrocketed to a high of over $68,000 in just six days. Over the past week, it rallied by double digits, gaining approximately 12%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,786, just 8% shy of its all-time high (ATH) of over $73,000. Consequently, optimism has been growing among traders, with many speculating that this bull cycle could propel Bitcoin to new highs. The combination of bullish sentiment and a potential supply shock has sparked renewed enthusiasm and interest in the asset, suggesting the rally may be far from over. While the king coin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market value, it has also managed to secure its spot among the top monetary assets. According to CompaniesMarketCap, Bitcoin now ranks as the 10th largest monetary asset globally. This achievement highlights Bitcoin’s growing influence not just in digital assets, but also in global financial markets.

The bitcoin price, which soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to BlackRock and China, has stalled after Tesla's $750 million worth of bitcoin moved to new addresses following two years of dormancy, sparking speculation Tesla may have sold off its remaining bitcoin. Now, as billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller issues a serious Federal Reserve warning, Elon Musk has repeated a warning that the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy."

[+] bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of around $70,000 per bitcoin. "Excess government spending is driving America to bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter. Musk's post quoted an anonymous finance account that had said "$500 billion was added to the national debt in just the last 3 weeks," adding: "The government is out of control." Meanwhile, speaking during a town hall meeting in Folsom, Pennsylvania, Musk warned inflation could again spiral out of control as a result of "crazy" government spending. "The Federal government is spending America into bankruptcy ... and that's what really leads to inflation ... when the government spends more than it brings in," Musk said, calling it a "pernicious" tax. "We have to radically reduce the amount of government spending so we don't rack up a government debt that's impossible to repay and we don't drive the country to bankruptcy," Musk said. Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. "Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Title: India's IPO record shattered with $5.5 billion launch
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/indias-ipo-record-shattered-with-55-billion-launch/a-70499104
Time Published: 2024-10-18T08:41:00Z

India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. South Korean carmaker Hyundai is banking on a Bombay listing to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, and was projected to be worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in the South Asian country since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai offered 142 million shares for sale, representing about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. By the end of Thursday, the IPO was twice oversubscribed, drawing bids of $5.51 billion. Reuters news agency cited unnamed sources linked to the listing as saying that Hyundai would price its shares at 1,960 rupees ($23.31, €21.49t), giving it a market valuation of $19 billion. That would value the Indian unit at about 40% of its Korean parent. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange, institutions, including foreign investors, bid nearly seven times the shares reserved for them. Nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday alone, including the government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, which picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million. Fidelity, meanwhile, bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth $340 million. Hyundai India shares are expected to start trading on Tuesday (October 22). Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Globally, Hyundai's IPO beats July's US listing by Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold-storage firm, which was worth $5.1 billion. Hyundai's listing will also eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year.

Departments, agencies and public bodies News stories, speeches, letters and notices Detailed guidance, regulations and rules Reports, analysis and official statistics Consultations and strategy Data, Freedom of Information releases and corporate reports Private finance experts met the Chancellor at No11 Downing Street today to boost investment in infrastructure and drive growth nationwide. Rachel Reeves convened the inaugural meeting of the British Infrastructure Taskforce as part of a new approach that involves government working with business to design policy that will unlock private investment, including by building business confidence in UK infrastructure investments. The Taskforce will explore different options to support the Government’s infrastructure goals to drive growth for the whole of the nation, and some of the UK’s biggest financial companies including LLoyds, HSBC, and M&G will be in attendance. This Government has committed to turbocharge infrastructure investment across the width and breadth of the UK. Invitees have been selected to ensure a wide range of experience and expertise in UK infrastructure. This marks a significant shift in approach, with key businesses and stakeholders invited to work with the government to support the delivery of its infrastructure agenda. It follows the announcement to launch a newly formed National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (NISTA) which will bring oversight of strategy and delivery under one roof. The NISTA will support the development and implementation of the ten-year infrastructure strategy in conjunction with industry which was outlined for the first time last week by the Chief Secretary Darren Jones. The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves MP said: Increasing investment in infrastructure is a vital part of delivering on our number one mission to grow the economy and create jobs. Just days after our International Investment Summit, we are delivering on our promise to work with business to drive growth across the country, and the expertise of this Taskforce will be invaluable in the weeks and months ahead. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones MP said: We are serious about ending the cycle of underinvestment that has plagued our infrastructure systems for over a decade. The best way to do that is to design the solution with business in the room. That’s what this taskforce is all about. The Taskforce will meet regularly, offering insights that deliver long-lasting solutions for job creation, growth, and environmental goals. This builds on the success of the International Investment Summit, which saw hundreds of top international investors attend the event, £63 billion of confirmed investment into Britain, along with the launch of the £27.8 billion turbocharged National Wealth Fund. Tracy Blackwell, CEO, PIC said: We have a huge amount to invest and we want to invest more in Britain. There is no shortage of capital that can support the British economy’s capacity to grow. The right combination of policies and ideas will unlock that capital and boost growth. From planning reform and better use of public sector pension funds to a streamlining of institutions and regulations, there is a lot that Government can do to crowd in more private investment and deliver social value. It’s great to be in an ongoing conversation with the Chancellor about taking that agenda forward. Andrea Rossi, CEO, M&G plc said: M&G has been an active investor in the UK for 175 years. Of the £100 billion M&G invests in the UK, infrastructure remains a core part of delivering sustainable returns for our savers, clients and shareholders. The UK’s clear focus on infrastructure presents a significant opportunity to deliver economic and social progress and we are delighted to contribute our expertise.” Deepa Bharadwaj, Head of Infrastructure Europe, IFM Investors said: IFM is a major global infrastructure investor, a major investor in the UK, and is owned by pension funds. We look forward to solutions-based discussions that can unlock new investment across UK infrastructure sectors and themes”. Stephen Cohen, Chief Product Officer, Blackrock said: There’s a rapidly growing pool of capital to invest in infrastructure, but deploying it requires pragmatism in policy. We’re pleased to be working with the government in identifying policies that will support private investment. Charlie Nunn, CEO, Lloyds Banking Group said: At Lloyds Banking Group, we are committed to helping the UK deliver the infrastructure the country needs, supporting jobs and growth. We welcome the British Infrastructure Taskforce’s focus on increasing investment in UK infrastructure and addressing some of the fundamental barriers that have existed to date. As the UK’s leading bank for project finance, we will work closely with the government in the development of this taskforce, ensuring the work supports communities, businesses, and industries across the regions and nations of the UK. Anne Richards, Vice Chair, Fidelity International said: We have a shared ambition to drive growth in the UK by unlocking investment in infrastructure for the benefit of savers. Our best opportunity to achieve that is through collaboration with government and the industry. Andy Briggs, CEO, Phoenix Group said: Over the last three decades there has been an underinvestment in the UK economy compared to other developed nations. I am delighted there is a growing consensus that in order to grow we need to work together to invest. The British Infrastructure Taskforce provides the opportunity for business and government to work on shared priorities, help finance the social and economic infrastructure the country needs for the future, and give potential for better returns for pension savers.

Earnings season is barely a week old. While the headlines have centered on big banks, Wall Street trading and credit card spending, the deluge of quarterly reports has yet to be seen from the digital upstarts populating the FinTech IPO Index. We’ll get there for sure. But in the meantime, in the past week, the prime movers of the FinTech IPO Index’s 3.7% surge came through the platforms, where partnerships and new products represented a broadening of the features and services offered to individuals and to businesses. That’s not to say that all platforms rose in lockstep. Futu shares sank 16.3%. The company said this week that it had launched its ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services, a new feature designed to deliver personalized investment solutions tailored to clients’ risk appetites and investment preferences. The company said it is working with BlackRock to offer Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios powered by BlackRock strategies and insights. Other platforms’ surges more than tipped the balance of the index’s momentum to the upside. As reported by PYMNTS, Paymentus — which saw its stock roar ahead by 24.3% — has introduced a tool to help insurers offer instant digital disbursements. The Paymentus Disbursements Accelerator added to the Guidewire ClaimCenter, and is designed to help insurers rapidly weave instant digital disbursement capabilities into their claims management processes. The accelerator, the release said, lets policyholders get payouts in the way they wish, including payments to digital wallets, credit or debit cards, ACH transfers or via check. Upstart’s stock gained 20.5%. In an annoucement late last week, the company detailed a programmatic purchase commitment from funds managed by Blue Owl Capital. Blue Owl’s Alternative Credit strategy will purchase up to $2 billion of consumer loans on the Upstart platform over 18 months. The transaction includes an initial acquisition of a $290 million personal loan portfolio, which closed in September. The transaction was structured and closed by Atalaya Capital Management, an alternative credit manager that focused primarily on asset-based credit investments across consumer and commercial finance, corporate and real estate assets. Alkami and Nutmeg State Financial Credit Union launched the latest version of its digital banking services with the Alkami Digital Banking Platform. The credit union’s members, per the announcement, have access to a wide range of online and mobile banking services, ranging from account aggregation, and financial wellness education and services. Alkami shares were up 5.7% SoFi is expanding its loan platform with a new $2 billion investment. The new “loan platform business agreement,” announced this week is based on funds that will be managed by affiliates of Fortress Investment Group. The agreement expands the capabilities of SoFi’s loan platform business, where the company refers prequalified borrowers to loan origination partners, while also originating loans on behalf of third parties. The announcement follows last week’s news that SoFi had added two new credit cards to its digital financial services offering: one for consumers who prioritize earning rewards on their daily spending, the other for those focused on building or improving their credit scores. SoFi shares added 14.4% through the past five sessions. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Byju’s was planning to go public in early 2022 with several investment bankers giving the firm valuation as high as $50 billion, TechCrunch reported earlier. He alleged that many of his more than 100 investors had urged him to pursue aggressive expansion into as many as 40 markets. But, he added, those very investors got cold feet when global markets tumbled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending the venture capital market into a downward spiral. Raveendran said many of his investors “ran away,” and the departure of three key backers — Prosus Ventures, Peak XV, and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — from the company’s board last year made it impossible for the startup to raise additional funds. Representatives of the aforementioned three firms as well as auditor Deloitte left the startup’s board last year, citing governance issues. Byju’s has since entered insolvency proceedings, and Raveendran, who no longer controls the company, said: “It’s worth zero. What valuation are you talking about? It’s worth zero.” Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup, counts BlackRock, UBS, Lightspeed, QIA, Bond, Silver Lake, Sofina, Verlinvest, Tencent, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Owl Ventures, and World Bank’s IFC among its backers. It has raised more than $5 billion to date. Raveendran said he remains hopeful that his startup will make a comeback. “I have nothing to lose. I came from a small village.

Title: Ambitious James Culhane keen to push on after two seasons of stop-start

It tells us much about James Culhane’s potential that despite being sidelined by various ailments and injuries, restricting him to just eight Leinster appearances during two seasons in their academy, he was upgraded to a senior contract in advance of this season. Now, after his second Emerging Ireland tour finished with him captaining the side to their concluding 33-24 win over the Cheetahs, Culhane could make his first start of the season against Connacht at the Dexcom Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 7.35pm). If so, it will be his first start for Leinster since the corresponding game in Galway which cruelly ended his season last December. “I tore my hammy and fractured my shoulder in the same game. So, there is a bit of trauma there. I think my hamstring is still somewhere around the 22-metre line of that pitch,” he says, showing a nice line in gallows humour. The injuries happened within two minutes of each other. “I did my shoulder first and was supposed to come off but I think Max Deegan had gone off for a ‘bloods’ so they were like ‘two minutes and then you can come off’. “Then we scored a try and I caught the kick-off. Right before I was to come off two lads jumped on my shoulder and I just went to step off my left leg and I felt it pop. I’ve never had an injury like that before, so I knew there was something seriously wrong. Then the scan said it all.” Having never suffered a hamstring injury before, he’d tore one off the bone. Now completing his degree in electrical engineering at UCD, his life is largely about time management, although his studies were a blessing during rehab. “I split my course up a little bit, but on average it is a 40-hour studying week, so it is tough to fit that in with training every week. But when I got injured, I had something to focus on and that was a big benefit. “I wasn’t just feeling sorry for myself the whole time. I’ve done well so far and I don’t think my parents [Paul and Margaret] would ever let me quit the college side of things, so I am forced to do it,” he says, smiling. Reared in Enniskerry, education has always been a priority for Culhane and his sisters Rosie and Lily, even though his dad was also a number eight who captained St Munchin’s, the Ireland Under-21s and Irish Universities (against a New Zealand team featuring Seán Fitzpatrick) before injury cut short his career. Like father, like son, they are both Arsenal fans, and Culhane was also a handy footballer with Wayside Celtic and Gaelic footballer with Kilmacud Crokes. He captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Junior Cup in 2018 and would have captained the senior team in 2020-21 but for Covid. In Ireland’s Under-20 Grand Slam-winning side of 2022 his record carrying metres (349 from 66 carries) saw him named player of the championship, but he was soon hospitalised for a month with a kidney infection, probably the consequence of overtraining and dehydration. While that was excessive, it shows how driven Culhane is. Bright and humble, but ambitious too, he describes the Emerging Ireland tour as “another stepping stone” and an opportunity to work with Paul O’Connell. “He kind of knows everything, to be honest.” Culhane also gives an interesting take on the “freshness” of Jacques Nienaber and Tyler Bleyendaal. “When Stu [Lancaster] was in he controlled both attack and defence. He kind of did it all himself, so it’s good to get different eyes on things. Jacques has the new defensive set-up that we’ve never really experienced in Irish rugby before. That’s still something we’re learning, but we’ve made good ground on that. “Attack-wise, it’s not too dissimilar, Tyler really enjoys just ‘play what’s in front of us’ sort of thing so it’s not always too systematic, especially on transition, whereas in the past we would have just focused on playing our own system, not seeing outside of it. But Tyler really encourages players to take space if they see it.” Mature beyond his years, Culhane captained Leinster in preseason friendlies this year and last, further demonstrating they know they have a good one here. This is also a big season for him. Not in an arrogant way, but more stating the obvious, Culhane says: “I think it’s time now to push into this Leinster team and it’s pretty obvious once you’re in a Leinster team that you’ll find yourself in an Irish squad. So, that’s the goal. Especially in my first year of senior, I’m trying to make some moves.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin ‘To the moon!’ What’s behind Michael Saylor’s prediction?

Time Published: 2024-10-18T04:30:47Z

BTC’s price rally fuels bullish sentiment, with supply shortage signalling more gains. Bitcoin [BTC] bulls are having a field day as their Uptober dreams appear to be turning into reality. This week, the king coin made a remarkable comeback, breaching critical resistance levels. On the 16th of October, the king coin climbed to $68,424, marking its highest price in nearly three months. MicroStrategy Co-Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor chimed in on the excitement, declaring, “To the moon.” His words captured the optimism among crypto enthusiasts, as Bitcoin’s surge fueled renewed confidence and excitement. At the time of writing, the coin had slightly pulled back to $67,458 but remained up by 0.97% over the past day and 10% over the past week. Aside from the positive price movement, developments on the supply side have fueled traders’ expectations for further gains. Firstly, Bitcoin miners produce only 450 BTC daily, which falls short of meeting the rising demand driven by ongoing accumulation from institutional investors. For instance, BlackRock recently added $391.8 million worth of Bitcoin to its holdings. Worth noting that spot Bitcoin ETFs hold total net assets of $64.46 billion, representing 4.82% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization, according to data from SoSo Value. Additionally, the circulating supply of Bitcoin has reached 19.77 million, accounting for 94.14% of the total supply. Lastly, as per CryptoQuant, the Exchange Reserve has fallen to a five-year low of just 2.6 million BTC. As a result of these factors, the likelihood of a supply shock appears increasingly imminent. Source: CryptoQuant To gain deeper insights into market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, AMBCrypto analyzed the derivative’s data. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) recently reached an all-time high of $20 billion, signaling increased participation and interest. Source: CryptoQuant CME Bitcoin Futures OI also hit a record high, reflecting growing institutional involvement. Moreover, the funding rate was positive at press time. Data from Coinglass showed a Long/Short Ratio of 1.02, indicating a slight preference for long positions. These metrics suggested overall optimism in the market. Amid the favorable market environment, with Saylor eyeing the moon, it seems that the moon might be around $70,000. The 6-month liquidation heatmap from Coinglass revealed a substantial liquidity cluster at this level, with $72,300 and $72,600 emerging as the next magnetic zones likely to attract the price. On the downside, significant liquidity was concentrated around $67,000 and $65,000. If BTC drops to sweep these levels, a rebound could follow. Source: Coinglass Thus, given Bitcoin’s trajectory, bulls remain hopeful of reclaiming the record highs set in March.

Title: Letters: We must reject far-right demagogues threatening democracies worldwide

Elon Musk endorses Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Photo: Getty As the US prepares to vote for a new president, the campaign here, and the candidates’ behaviour, should act as a warning to voters in Ireland and other democracies around the world. For more than a decade we have been plagued by far-right rhetoric and disinformation designed to activ­ate the worst instincts of people. Donald Trump’s cult-like following has debased our politics and our civic society, making us weaker, darker, more resentful, angrier and more polarised. It has enabled racist, ignor­ant, misogynistic, nativist groups to emerge and foment divisions that harm the nation and our social fabric. The appeal, however limited, of Independent Ireland and the move in Ireland to create a National Alliance of far-right groups is cause for alarm. Ignorance and disinformation are key to the growth of these movements. Democracies need to strengthen civic institutions, elevate civil discourse and educate young people to understand why it’s important to participate in their communities. Demagogues like Trump, Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson feed on the worst impulses of people, and they offer no constructive solutions. At the same time, mainstream political parties need to devise and seriously embrace policies that address problems including housing, healthcare, immigration, environmental devastation and economic opportunity. These are problems to be solved by serious, thoughtful political parties and policy-makers, informed by data and open to rational debate. Far-right demagogues who threaten democracies do long-term harm and need to be rejected by voters. Jim McManus, Massachusetts, US The slanted reporting of most journalists on the US presidential election is blatant. Their failure to report the truth is disappointing and harmful. Fair and balanced reporting is ess­ential to guarantee the authenticity of the democratic process. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin The electoral college, another 18th-century remnant, will deliver the presidency to Donald Trump or Kam­ala Harris next month, contradicting the popular vote and, for many, rendering the election meaningless. Until this outdated remnant is disbanded, US democracy will continue to discredit itself. It’s my contention that the vote of every US citizen should count – not just those of partisan electoral college insiders. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary When Sinn Féin forgot, or neglected, the historical reason for the depart­ure of Éamon de Valera and his followers to form Fianna Fáil (“a slightly constitutional party”), it was bound to run into its current difficulties. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said recently that Leo Varadkar “has found his inner Shinner”. I would say the Shinners have “found parliamentary democracy” a threat to their totalitarianism. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia Have some members of Dáil Eireann taken a pay cut? Convalescing following an illness, I watched proceedings in Leinster House at government “question time” and was less than impressed by the sartorial inelegance of some of our elected representatives. It looked like dress-down Friday, but it was only Tuesday. I also noted an urban/rural divide, with those deputies from beyond the Pale showing respect for their office, their constituents and themselves, in turning out dressed appropriately for the privileged positions they hold. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan Further to Tom Grufferty’s letter on kindness being “only in Ireland”, (Letters, October 17), I was reminded of a school trip some years ago when we visited several eastern Europe countries where the Irish students were intimidated by the stern attit­udes of border officials. It was only on their return to Dublin, greeted by border management personnel with jokes, smiles and being addressed by their first names, that they finally relaxed. Ireland of the hundred thousand welcomes indeed. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Rian Noctor reminds us of one of the greats of Irish rugby, Anthony ‘Axel’ Foley, whose death eight years ago at the age of 42 shocked the sporting world (‘“He’s always spoken about” – Munster aim for Stormers win as tribute to Anthony Foley’, Irish Independent, October 17). There’s a beautiful and striking riverside memorial stone to the rugby legend in his native Limerick at a place called Clancy’s Strand on The Three Bridges River Walk. Whenever I pass this stunning statue erected in his honour in this rugby-mad city, I’m reminded of how fleeting life is, but also how sport can be a force for good when played with the passion and excitement with which the former No 8 thrilled his fans. Munster will be hoping that the legend of Axel Foley will propel them to victory away to the Stormers in Cape Town this weekend. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry The Los Angeles Archdiocese has agreed to pay $880m (€813m) in response to sexual abuse claims. It appears many of these clerics didn’t read their Bibles. Matthew 18:2-6 states: “If anyone causes one of these little ones – those who believe in me – to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” How can people supposedly devoted to doing right do what they did? There are so many clergy who do so much good, but there are a few that let the team down.

Here is a quote: “The Biden-Harris administration’s ban on new permits for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports threatens nearly one million jobs over the next two decades if the restriction remains in place, a new study finds. The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) conducted a study in partnership with PwC that was shared exclusively with FOX Business and found that between 515,960 and 901,250 jobs – as well as about $103.9 billion in labor income – would be threatened if the ban remains in place through 2044. The analysis used the Department of Energy’s outlook prior to the ban announcement to calculate its potential long-term impact. The export ban would stifle the U.S. GDP by between $122.5 billion and $215.7 billion in 2044, while between $26.9 billion and $47.7 billion in tax and royalty revenues to federal, state and local governments would be at risk in 2044 if the permit pause persists, the study found.” o o o H.L. sent us this: Orange Juice Prices Near Record Highs Amid Fears Of Worst Florida Harvest In A Century. o o o H.L. suggested this at Zero Hedge: Dozens Of Meat Processing Plants Expected To Shut Down Under New EPA Rules. o o o A Historic Short Squeeze In Oil Has Only Begun. 2024 Harris Tax Proposals: Details & Analysis. o o o Donald Trump Tax Plan Ideas: Details and Analysis. o o o Bloomberg: 2024 Tax Calendar. o o o US budget deficit hits $1.8 trillion for fiscal 2024, per CBO.

Title: USDT Popularity Soars As Tether Adds Over 36 Million Users in Q3 2024

Time Published: 2024-10-17T21:00:58Z

Tether’s USDT, the largest crypto stablecoin, recently celebrated its 10th year in the industry. The company’s growth has been impressive, thanks to its steady user base, holdings that include $97 billion in US government bonds, and its plans to partner with US law enforcement agencies to strengthen its brand. Now, the team behind Tether can find another reason to celebrate: data suggest that Tether’s USDT user growth recorded its best quarter in Q3 by adding 36.25 million new users. The company added that its quarterly user data has increased by 9% on average over the last 12 months, giving it enough cushion as it expands its use cases and applications. In a post at Tether.io, the company boasts of an increasing adoption of its stablecoin, reporting over 330 million in-chain wallets and accounts. The company clarified that these refer to users who have received the stablecoin by the end of the third quarter. This number excludes users who use the coin in centralized platforms such as Binance and Coinbase, which also numbers to several million. An October 16th report indicated tens of millions of Tether customers on these exchanges and off-chain venues. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, most users are from developing countries. He explained that the majority of users buy USDT to hedge against inflation and their country’s weak monetary systems. Part of Tether’s success in the industry is its support of tier 1 blockchains like Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain. According to the company, Ethereum-based layer-2 networks contributed the most users this quarter. Last year, Arbitrum and Polygon added the most users to Tether’s pool. Telegram’s The Open Network (TON) was also instrumental in growing Tether’s user base. According to Philip Gradwell of Tether, TON added 3.3 million users in six months, which accounts for 1% of all on-chain accounts. As Tether continues to pick up millions of new users, the company is looking for ways to expand its reach. According to reports, the company is studying ways to enter traditional finance through lending. The company has also invested in a few startups, like Bitdeer, a crypto mining company, and Blackrock Neurotech. However, its most exciting move this year relates to image-building. In a Fox Business interview, Ardoino shared that collaboration with US law enforcement agencies is doing well. If Tether improves its image, we can see more significant user growth in the next few quarters.

Rogozinski, CEO of the Partnership. “The strategy and objectives of BlackRock Impact Opportunities are closely aligned with those of the Partnership, and we believe that together we can deploy capital to increase the availability of affordable multifamily housing in underserved areas while achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns for our respective investors.” Brian Mwarania, Senior Investor for BlackRock Impact Opportunities said, “We are proud to partner with Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP. Our new Joint Venture aims to address the acute shortage of high-quality affordable housing across the US through innovative construction financing solutions. We look forward to working closely with the Partnership to structure compelling investments that achieve our clients’ social impact objectives.” The Partnership has deep investment experience in direct affordable multifamily lending, including investments in construction loans that position affordable properties for permanent agency financing, such as Freddie Mac’s Tax Exempt Loan (“TEL”) program. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership will be the Joint Venture’s managing member, responsible for identifying, evaluating, underwriting, and closing investments, subject to BIO’s review and approval under the terms and conditions of the Joint Venture. Raymond James served as the transaction advisor to the Partnership. Ballard Spahr LLP served as the legal advisor to the Partnership. Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP served as the legal advisor to BIO. _________________________[1]National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Title: Analyst Explains What Could Drive Bitcoin’s Price ‘Above $500,000 Before the Decade Ends’
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/analyst-explains-what-could-drive-bitcoins-price-above-500000-before-the-decade-ends/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T19:20:05Z
Full Content:
On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts shared a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in light of growing institutional support. Coutts emphasized that a significant shift in asset allocation preferences is happening, spurred by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin. Coutts said that with BlackRock’s Aladdin platform—used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for modeling and attribution—offering seamless Bitcoin integration through its ETF, the path for Bitcoin to rise further has been paved. Coutts predicted that even a small shift in institutional allocations from traditional assets like sovereign debt to Bitcoin could push the price of BTC beyond $500,000 by the end of the decade. Coutts’ current analysis echoes points he made in a 17 April 2023 post, where he outlined the risks posed to bondholders by Bitcoin’s rise. He noted that debasement—resulting from excessive money printing and swelling global debt—is a growing issue for portfolio managers, and Bitcoin has increasingly served as a hedge against this trend. At that time, Coutts had argued that Bitcoin, with its disinflationary supply and growing adoption, could replace bonds as an essential component of diversified portfolios, especially as government bonds have consistently underperformed against rising monetary supply. Even then, Coutts suggested that if just 1% of the global bond market shifted to Bitcoin, it could push the price of BTC to around $185,000. In his recent post, Coutts revisited this theme, pointing out that during the last bear market, Bitcoin had outperformed bonds, commodities, and many equities, reinforcing its strength as a long-term store of value. He noted that traditional asset classes had not adequately compensated managers for the risks they faced in an era of low real returns and high inflation. The shift away from bonds is now inevitable, according to Coutts, despite government mandates for bond purchases or new banking regulations, as Bitcoin emerges as a more viable alternative. Coutts added that the rise of Bitcoin in portfolios of massive sovereign wealth funds is still feasible, even with liquidity challenges. He argued that with BlackRock now actively promoting Bitcoin and other major institutional players offering the necessary tools for risk modeling and portfolio attribution, the ongoing debasement trend will only strengthen Bitcoin’s position. In his opinion, every time a fund manager opts for Bitcoin over sovereign debt, it further validates this shift. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Data from Farside Investors shows that total net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs have now hit $20.2 billion. And that’s even accounting for the $20 billion that has fled from Grayscale’s fund. In the ETF world, flows are the amount of money coming in and out of a product. They are a good measurement of how well a fund is performing as it shows how active the vehicle is. Investors have put billions of dollars into the funds but have also cashed billions out of Grayscale’s GBTC. Grayscale’s investment product previously operated like a closed-end fund, making it difficult for investors to redeem shares. Its conversion in January led to a flood of capital out of the product as investors sought cheaper ETFs or cashed out their gains. But Grayscale clients are more or less done cashing out, it seems, and money is fast entering Bitcoin ETFs from other issuers again—particularly this week, with nearly $2 billion in inflows already. Of the 10 ETFs currently trading, Wall Street titan BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has received the lion’s share of inflows, with over $22.4 billion, Farside numbers show. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that gold ETFs took five years to reach the same overall flows as what the Bitcoin ETFs have notched in 10 months. Bitcoin ETFs have crossed $20b in total net flows (the most imp number, most difficult metric to grow in ETF world) for first time after huge week of $1.5b. For context, it took gold ETFs about 5yrs to reach same number. Total assets now $65b, also a high water mark. pic.twitter.com/edldEimfqd — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 17, 2024 ETFs allow investors to buy shares that track the price of an underlying asset, which could be anything from gold and foreign currencies to Bitcoin and tech stocks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light to 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January after a decade of denials. A flood of capital fast entered the space following the approval of the products as investors and institutions previously cautious about buying the cryptocurrency could do so via brokerage accounts; major asset managers like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity take care of custody and buying and selling the digital coins. Speculators then slowed down putting cash into the products when it was uncertain what the Federal Reserve would do regarding historically high interest rates. But following the central bank’s decision to cut last month, investors have again gained an appetite for “risk-on” assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s price currently stands at $67,373, according to CoinGecko, after having risen by nearly 11% over seven days. Just two months after the Bitcoin ETFs were approved, the biggest digital coin hit a new all-time high of $73,737. Balchunas previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin, which has had its share of ups and downs this year, would have struggled to retain its value had it not been for the new investment vehicles trading on American stock exchanges.

Title: Charging ahead: Key reasons for confidence in a commercial EV trucking future
URL: https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2024/10/17/charging-ahead-key-reasons-for-confidence-in-a-commercial-ev-trucking-future/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T18:17:02Z

By Maaz Haider As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the impacts of climate change have become a tangible concern for millions of people. Among the largest contributors to this crisis is transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have an outsized impact. Hence, reducing transportation emissions is essential. Transitioning to zero-emission trucks will slash climate and air pollution everywhere, improve local economies by creating new jobs, strengthen national security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, and save fleets money on fuel — all of which are especially critical now. While uncertainties remain about the ultimate pace of scaling zero-emission medium- & heavy-duty vehicles, this presents an opportunity for innovative partnerships. By working together to address challenges, we can accelerate the transition to zero-emission trucks and reinforce the transportation sector’s commitment to a sustainable future. Infrastructure improvements: The backbone of EV success The industry has made significant strides in developing charging infrastructure to support electric trucks. Private investment, as well as support from government programs, is beginning to address the infrastructure challenge. Fueled by public and private funds, there are now around 183,000 public charging ports in operation within the U.S. as of Q2 2024–well on target to meet Biden’s administration goal of half a million public ports by 2030. The funds allocated under the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program and the Charging & Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grants program are actively being awarded and implemented. Three charging sites in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are already operational under NEVI, with 47 additional projects announced under CFI, which will deploy over 5,000 Level 2 chargers and more than 600 Level 3 fast chargers. Efforts led by other private groups solidify the future of public charging in the country. Notably, Forum Mobility will be deploying 1,000 DC fast chargers in California. Furthermore, Greenlane, a partnership between Daimler, NextEra Energy and BlackRock, to develop a nationwide network of high-performance charging stations starting with a 280-mile corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Recently, a group of carriers and shippers, which includes AIT Worldwide, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, PepsiCo and others, have formed a coalition to pilot heavy-duty charging with Terawatt Infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. Technological advancements: Breaking the range barrier and demonstrating reliability and performance Advancements in battery technology continue to improve the capacity of electric trucks, including adding range and reducing charging times. Legacy manufacturers like Daimler and Freightliner, along with new entrants such as Nikola, Tesla and Windrose, are leading the charge in electric truck innovation, offering impressive ranges on a single charge. Tesla’s Semi truck promises a range of up to 500 miles with PepsiCo, one of the early adopters of the Semi, having successfully integrated these trucks into its fleet for regional distribution. Real-world data from Pepsi’s deployment has successfully accomplished a 1000+ mile journey in a single day. Further data revealed by NFI which also piloted the Tesla Semi’s reveals impressive efficiency statistics surpassing performance expectations and highlighting the vehicle’s long-range capabilities. Another new entrant in the market is Windrose with their EV trucks offering upwards of a 400-mile range at full load. As per the Zero-Emissions Technology Inventory, or ZETI, tool there are currently 21 different OEMs, or Original Equipment Manufacturers, offering 24 different EV van and truck models with a range of 200+ miles. Financial incentives and operational savings: The economic argument While the sticker price of electric trucks is higher compared to traditional diesel trucks, as per BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2024, due to battery cost reduction and efficiency improvements, zero-emission trucks’ cost parity can be reached even sooner with the urban duty cycle becoming cost competitive before 2030. Furthermore, subsidies and tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act and public grants can help offset the upfront capital costs. Specifically, IRA provision 45W allows fleets to reduce the cost of an electric truck by up to $40,000, while provision 30C enables savings of up to 30% on the cost of installing charging infrastructure. Moreover, the total cost of ownership savings outlook for electric trucks is further amplified due to savings on fuel and maintenance. Titan Freight Systems demonstrated these cost savings for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in a presentation at the ACT Expo 2024 showcasing 10% and 7% savings in these applications respectively. The savings will increase as more EVs are deployed since the cost of existing charging infrastructure will be spread across a larger fleet Make like bamboo: From laying the groundwork to rapid growth and advancement The growth of EVs and charging infrastructure in the U.S. can be likened to the growth of a bamboo shoot. After years growing deep roots with little visible growth above ground, bamboo suddenly shoots up rapidly, symbolizing how foundational work leads to swift, visible progress. Similarly, the EV industry initially experienced slow adoption, focused on building the necessary technology, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness. However, with these strong foundations now in place, thanks to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, NEVI, and other initiatives, the industry is experiencing rapid growth, much like bamboo’s sudden upward shoot. According to the EDF Electric Fleet Deployment & Commitment tracking tool commercial EV deployments grew 5 times with more than 10,000 Class 2b-8 EVs deployed in 2023 followed by more than 15,000 EVs deployed year to date in 2024. The EV industry’s steady groundwork is enabling companies in the U.S. to quickly expand their EV truck fleets, making significant strides toward sustainable transportation.

Title: Can Bitcoin Save The U.S.A From $35 Trillion In National Debt? Experts Explore
URL: https://zycrypto.com/can-bitcoin-save-the-u-s-a-from-35-trillion-in-national-debt-experts-explore/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T17:16:39Z
Full Content:
As the United States confronts a staggering $35 trillion national debt, discussions about utilizing Bitcoin as a potential solution have gained traction among economists and policymakers. In a Tuesday report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that global public debt will exceed $100 trillion in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for about a third of this liability. This backdrop has prompted experts to explore whether cryptocurrency can help address the national debt crisis. In August, former President Donald Trump suggested that selling “a few bitcoins” could help eliminate the national debt. This bold assertion has sparked a heated debate about the practicality of using Bitcoin to manage such a colossal financial burden. According to the IMF report, the U.S. national debt is projected to grow by approximately 5.5% in 2024, translating to an increase of about $2 trillion. The federal government pays nearly $1 trillion annually to cover interest on this debt. Traditionally, the government addresses budget shortfalls by issuing bonds, which banks can then leverage to create new money, a process that fuels inflation and complicates fiscal stability. While using BTC to offset national debt seems attractive, experts caution that it oversimplifies complex economic realities. Paul Muller, a senior fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, believes that a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies could stimulate economic growth, ultimately benefiting citizens. “Making it easier to develop and run Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency projects in the U.S. will be good for the economy,” he recently noted. The international landscape adds another layer of complexity. A declining number of countries are willing to hold U.S. bonds, a situation exacerbated by rising geopolitical tensions. Notably, Tether, a major player in the cryptocurrency space, has emerged as one of the top holders of U.S. government debt, illustrating a shift in traditional financial dynamics. In light of these challenges, some experts are investigating the potential of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which involves converting traditional assets into blockchain-based tokens. BlackRock, for example, has begun tokenizing U.S. government debt, suggesting a possible path forward that leverages the benefits of both traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, Bitcoin’s volatility poses risks. Following Trump’s remarks, Bitcoin’s price plummeted by about 15%, illustrating how sensitive the crypto market is to political statements. Some experts warn that integrating Bitcoin into government debt management could destabilize the U.S. dollar and lead to higher inflation. Ultimately, while the prospect of using Bitcoin to tackle the national debt is intriguing, experts agree that it requires a more nuanced understanding of both cryptocurrency and economic policy.

Like what you see? You can subscribe here. India is mourning the death of Ratan Tata, the visionary industrialist and philanthropist. The former chairman of the Tata Group is known for bringing the storied salt-to-software conglomerate to the global stage via a string of high-profile acquisitions. His strong business acumen led him to become one of India's wealthiest tycoons. The billionaire placed 421 in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022, based on his net worth of approximately 38 billion Indian rupees ($452 million). Another list by Fortune India-Waterfield captured his net worth as 160.4 billion Indian rupees, a figure that includes his stakes in Tata Sons, Tata Steel, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors and Titan Company. Ratan Tata — along with the Ambani and Adani families — have become household names given their wealth and influence. They are, however, becoming less representative of the South Asian powerhouse's growing super-rich population. A new rich populace "The previous school of thought was that rich people were just the Tatas, Birlas or the Ambanis. But, that's changing today — the rich are not just leaders of traditional business conglomerates," Himanshu Kohli, the co-founder of Indian multi-family office and private wealth manager Client Associates, said. Speaking to CNBC's Inside India, Kohli noted that India's wealthy now come from a swathe of industries. "Lots of money has been created, whether it is in the sports arena, movies, among celebrities, investment bankers or private equity professionals," he explained. Professionals, who have "created substantial value" in their jobs or organizations, are now also making the cut, Kohli noted. These individuals — who are often in the C-suite bracket — can "create $50 to $200 million in wealth over a lifetime," he said. Another group of individuals attaining the rich status are "owners of listed companies who have sold part of their shares into the stock market rally, owners of hitherto unlisted businesses who have sold shares in their IPOs and startup founders who have sold their businesses, or shares to multinationals or bigger companies," said Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. The comments come as more Indians choose to set up their own company instead of working for an organization. Data from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore revealed that the number of startups in India rose 71.5% from around 20,000 in 2021, to over 34,000 in 2023. Many Indian startups capitalized on the private equity boom by selling shares in 2022, prior to the funding winter. Others are now riding on India's IPO boom to cash out of their startups in the hope of making gains. "Before the funding winter hit, a lot of startup founders created wealth by selling off their shares. That's given them a lump sum to invest and become active investors in financial markets. Others are listing now and getting substantial gains. Both moves are giving founders lots of wealth," Gubbi told CNBC's Inside India. Elsewhere, the investment manager also observed that individuals across ages and professions have benefitted from the stock market rallies in India over the last three to four years. India's stock market became the fourth-largest in the world at the start of the year, after overtaking Hong Kong. Since then, markets have been making steady gains with the BSE Sensex index — which represents 30 of the country's largest and most traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange — up around 12% year-to-date, while the benchmark Nifty 50 index is around 13.8% higher. What is 'rich'? There is no fixed definition of "rich" used by wealth managers. However, a widely accepted threshold for individuals in the high-net-worth bracket is 50–250 million Indian rupees. Individuals with wealth exceeding 250 million Indian rupees fall under the ultra-high-net-worth category, Kohli said. Meanwhile, those whose wealth falls between 10 to 50 million Indian rupees are in the affluent category, he added. India's ultra-wealthy population — people with a net worth of at least $30 million — rose to 13,263 in 2023, a 6.1% increase from the prior year, according to Knight Frank. This number is expected to surge 50.1% between 2023 and 2028, the fastest growth rate for UHNWIs in the world, the same report stated. Kohli estimates that the UHNWI population is growing at 10% per annum while that of the HNWIs is 16%. "This means that every few minutes 1 HNWI with a projected wealth of $1 million is born while 3 UHNWIs with upwards of $30 million is born in India every day. That's the tailwinds happening in our society today," he said. What's also interesting is the shift in age profile of these individuals. Historically, India's wealthy had a median age exceeding 50. Today, however, seeing millionaires aged 30 or 40 is not uncommon, said Marcellus' Gubbi. Another trend, he adds, is that they do not necessarily live in the nation's metropolises. "The bulk of the accumulation of wealth has happened in bigger cities. Having said that, I think the wealth management industry is also penetrating into tier two and tier three cities," Gubbi said. Examples of these cities include Pune, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. Beyond the city centers, he sees the wealthy coming up in industrial areas such as in the outskirts of Chennai, which are "getting prosperous, particularly with the growth in manufacturing." Drivers of India's wealth The growth in India's wealthy population comes in tandem with the nation's economic progress. The South Asian giant is slated to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027, assuming its current growth trajectory continues. "India's economy is doing well, its stock market is doing well and it is the only other economy after the U.S. to have created wealth in the stock market consistently over the last 30 years since its liberalization," Gubbi said. The nation's prosperity, he added, has benefitted both businesses and individuals by enabling "stronger wealth accumulation." Another factor fueling the rise in India's wealthy is a shift from physical assets, such as gold and land, to financial assets like stocks, mutual funds and alternatives, the investment manager observed. The move was driven in large part by a pullback in money generated predominantly through tax evasions and unaccounted transactions in real estate, he said. The good news is that the move to financial assets brought on "an exponential" growth in wealth as it yielded higher returns, he added. Implications of a wealthy populace The legions of the wealthy in India are consequential to the nation's growth story. Their outsized influence relative to their population size on consumption patterns and investment behavior is reflective of India's economic story. "I think a lot of UHNWIs and HNWIs want to use their money to invest in themselves and the future generations by spending on better quality products and services," said Malcolm Dorson, a senior portfolio manager at Global X ETFs. Global X's parent, Mirae Asset, is one of the largest foreign asset managers in India. Looking ahead, he expects a myriad of sectors ranging from wealth management to autos, health care, real estate and education to benefit from this premiumization wave. "You're seeing a lot of the UHNWI and HNWIs investing in things like luxury vehicles from say Mercedes and Volvo to good quality jewelry from Titan and better health care at private hospitals like Apollo Hospitals. And so, that's where the opportunities for growth lie in India as more people become affluent," Dorson added. Canada expels Indian diplomats; India responds by expelling Canadian diplomats. Canadian authorities made the move after discovering evidence the Indian government targeted Canadian citizens in a campaign related to the 2023 assassination of a Sikh activist in Canada. "The RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case," Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said in a statement. BlackRock and the Government of Singapore buy shares in Hyundai Motor India IPO. The two entities each purchased $77.3 million worth of shares in Hyundai Motor India, while Fidelity bought a $76.5 million stake. A total of $989.4 million shares were sold to institutional investors. The automaker's IPO amounts to $3.3 billion, India's largest share offering, and the second-largest IPO globally this year. It's also the first time Hyundai Motor is listing outside South Korea. The stock will list publicly on Oct. 22. UK prioritizes trade deal with India. "There are clear economic and commercial reasons why we should pursue" trade deals with India and Gulf states, said U.K. Business and Trade Minister Jonathan Reynolds. Talks between the two countries are now in their 15th round and could resume this month, according to India's Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal. But India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal urged patience. "A trade deal is never done with a gun on the head, either to U.K. or to India," Goyal said. Indian stocks have lost around 1% over the last five trading days, following a flat week the week before. The Nifty 50 index is back under 25,000 points, but up nearly 14% this year. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield has traded mostly sideways this week, hitting 6.775% by Thursday afternoon. On CNBC TV this week, Manish Chokhani, director at ENAM Holdings, said that most multinationals operating in developed economies are seeing a slowdown. Hence, those companies are channeling investments to India, where "growth prospects and therefore the terminal values are that much higher." Meanwhile, Citi's Chief India Economist Samiran Chakraborty discussed how the country's balance of payments surplus has to be mopped up by the Reserve Bank of India. He also said that underemployment in the Indian labor force is a bigger challenge than unemployment. Hyundai Motor trades publicly October 22, while flash data of India's manufacturing and services PMI releases October 24. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs surpass $20 billion in net inflows, nearing Satoshi’s holdings

Excluding the massive outflows from Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) makes the net inflows for the Newborn Nine over $40 billion Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reached a significant milestone, surpassing $20 billion in total net inflows for the first time, according to data shared by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The achievement follows a week of extraordinary inflows totaling $1.5 billion, indicating growing investor demand for crypto exposure via ETFs. Balchunas highlighted that net inflows are the “most important” and “most difficult” metric to grow in the ETF industry, making this milestone particularly noteworthy. By comparison, it took gold ETFs nearly five years to hit the same net inflow figure. Some in the community highlighted that excluding the massive outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) makes the net inflows for the Newborn Nine over $40 billion, an even more staggering number compared to other ETF launches in the market’s history. Balchunas acknowledged the impact of the outflows but argued that including GBTC showcases the growth and eliminates all avenues of criticism. He said: “I like net [because] it’s net GBTC so there’s simply no way for haters to poke holes in it. You have to respect it.” US Bitcoin ETFs now manage $65 billion in total assets and collectively hold roughly 951,000 Bitcoin, a new record high. Balchunas noted that the ETFs will soon rival the estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin held by the flagship crypto’s mysterious pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. He said: “Bitcoin ETFs are 86% of the way to Satoshi.” The surge in inflows has not only bolstered the total assets under management but also impacted the available supply of Bitcoin. With major institutional holders like BlackRock continuing to accumulate, Bitcoin ETFs are playing an increasingly significant role in concentrating ownership of the digital asset. As demand for Bitcoin ETFs grows, their influence on the broader market is likely to intensify, offering regulated investment vehicles that continue to attract both retail and institutional investors. The growing dominance of Bitcoin ETFs highlights their critical role in shaping the future of crypto investments as more investors seek secure and regulated ways to gain exposure to digital assets.

Title: Ukraine the Origin of World War III

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/17/2024 9:16:28 AM PDT by delta7 QUESTION #1: Why does the West hail Zelensky when I have family in Ukraine who see him as a traitor to Ukraine? Asking Turkmenistan to arrest Putin is asking them to commit suicide. Zelensky is a war criminal, for he takes orders from the West against his own people. Your 172-year cycle that turned in 2020, did that mark the rise of the Neocons with Biden? Also, when will this war end? QUESTION #2: Zelensky’s speech to the Ukrainian Parliament is World War III. There is no compromise on anything. He wants immediate NATO entry, long-range missiles to destroy Russia, and a continued invasion of Russia. What planet is he on? If our leaders agree to this, there will be no peace ever, and Putin would be justified in wiping out Europe. I have friends from Kyiv, and they are all about hating Russians. You are correct. Yugoslavia broke up according to ethnic lines. Is there any way to stop Zelensky in this madness? ANSWER: Zelensky is as evil as you possibly can get. Any Western leader who even supports Ukraine and Zelensky should be thrown out of office. Where in hell does anyone with basic brain function expect to destroy Russia and they will not retaliate? If Putin realizes there will never be peace from here on out with the West, then there is no other option but the destruction of Western society. The NATO charter prohibits it from accepting any member who is engaged in the war for that would instantaneously invoke them all. He wants long-range missiles to destroy Russia for a NATO invasion, most likely creating some false flag. Remove Putin, and you will get all out World War III with nukes, for those he has been restraining are the Russian Neocons, who are just as bad as ours in the West. We have to accept that those in power want World War III to (1) get out of debt, (2) reduce population, and (3) the climate change people want Russia destroyed to end their sales of fossil fuels. With such arrogance, perhaps the only way to wake up people in the West is to use at least a Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power, known as the “Father of All Bombs.” The yield is the equivalent of 44 tons of TNT. This bomb’s blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon. My sources insist that this weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim, but it is a Thermobaric weapon that sucks in the oxygen. Perhaps the only way to bring this to a head is to destroy Kiev. Drop the leaflets as the US did in Japan, telling the civilians to vacate immediately. Either they overthrow Zelensky and then seize control of their own country since he has suspended any election to retain dictatorial power and is the Hezbollah equivalent of Iran to NATO. Ukraine must be freed from the hands of NATO and American Neocons, or there will be NOTHING left to return to. Just look at this array. The computer is showing Ukraine has flat-lined into 2027. There is no victory. It will be totally destroyed thanks to this high-heel dancing proxy of NATO and the Neocons. This is not my opinion – it is FACT! Zelensky is completely drunk with power and is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Neocons, who want the total destruction of Russia. So, let’s get this straight. We should all sacrifice our future and that of our children all for the personal hatred of Russians by Zelensky and the Neocons. They always assume they will win, but their track record is clear – they have lost EVERY war since World War II. This war will not end until 2027 and there will be nothing left of Ukraine. So much for Zelensky’s Victory Plan. He is waging a Phyric War for a group of people who have lost every war against Russia since World War II. As for Question #1, to answer part one, yes, the Neocons orchestrated the usurpation of the White House in 2020 and marked a change in trend. This was a usurpation of American foreign policy by the Neocons. They have steered Kamala to take the White House to retain this usurpation of power. The rise of the Neocons and this thrust into World War III began with the 2020 Coup and the rigged election to secure ultimate power. STOP the BS about Trump, and look at the damn facts! Vote for abortion and Kamala while you support Blinken and World War III. Talk about being outright brainwashed and stupid! I have had dinner with people from the International Criminal Court. It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026. I suggest watching the Arrays on Ukraine for the specific people of risk. The computer clearly has gone flat line on Ukraine, and it will NOT exist post-2027.

The CIA attacked Ukraine in 2014 when it overthrew the elected, neutral government. That very day Nuland installed a succession of NATO quislings. By 2022 these DC goons were responsible for murdering 14,000 ethnic Russians in Ukraine. After drawing a NATO red line in ‘22 Putin decided to take NATO’s war to NATO. You’re right, the Russians are having a terrible time defending themselves against the NATO hordes screaming “kill the Russians” on their border. Russia would be stupid not to take NATO at its word when it says “victory only occurs when Russia is destroyed”. I take the maniacs in DC at their ranting! The warmongering ghouls can kill us all by continued escalation. Putin is just letting you know how your children and his grandchildren will die when DC has its way. 9 posted on 10/17/2024 9:55:38 AM PDT by Saintgermain ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 5 | View Replies] To: delta7 Martin Armstrong is a convicted felon who served 11 years in a federal prison. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_A._Armstrong#:~:text=He%20was%20released%20from%20federal,receiver%2C%20according%20to%20court%20filings.

The popular protests were a genuine reaction to his betraying Ukraine, reneging on the EU/Ukraine deal that he had earlier supported, and trying to tie Ukraine to Russia with the Eurasian Economic Union. The protest became violent after he set security forces against the crowds. He then fled the country and was removed from office the the democratically elected parliament.That very day Nuland installed a succession of NATO quislings. Yanukovych's immediate successor was chosen by the parliament. There were then a national election in which Petro Poroshenko was elected, followed by the 2019 election which Zelensky won. Sorry, no CIA installation.By 2022 these DC goons were responsible for murdering 14,000 ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Again, it never happened. Pure Russian propaganda.After drawing a NATO red line in ‘22 Putin decided to take NATO’s war to NATO. No, Putin attacked because he thought that he would meet no resistance and could bring Ukraine back under Russian control. He attacked not because he feared NATO, but because he didn't. 16 posted on 10/17/2024 10:48:02 AM PDT by Petrosius [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: kiryandil That seems to be one of our ghost posters.

They have used your same idiotic Russian fear-mongering against Trump and American conservatives And when they and their Ukraine puppets are destroyed in their latest failure, they and your ilk will move on to some other asinine misadventure - probably Iran or Taiwan.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson QUESTION #2: Zelensky’s speech to the Ukrainian Parliament is World War III. There is no compromise on anything. He wants immediate NATO entry, long-range missiles to destroy Russia, and a continued invasion of Russia. What planet is he on? If our leaders agree to this, there will be no peace ever, and Putin would be justified in wiping out Europe. I have friends from Kyiv, and they are all about hating Russians. You are correct. Yugoslavia broke up according to ethnic lines. Is there any way to stop Zelensky in this madness? ANSWER: Zelensky is as evil as you possibly can get. Any Western leader who even supports Ukraine and Zelensky should be thrown out of office. Where in hell does anyone with basic brain function expect to destroy Russia and they will not retaliate? If Putin realizes there will never be peace from here on out with the West, then there is no other option but the destruction of Western society. The NATO charter prohibits it from accepting any member who is engaged in the war for that would instantaneously invoke them all. He wants long-range missiles to destroy Russia for a NATO invasion, most likely creating some false flag. Remove Putin, and you will get all out World War III with nukes, for those he has been restraining are the Russian Neocons, who are just as bad as ours in the West. We have to accept that those in power want World War III to (1) get out of debt, (2) reduce population, and (3) the climate change people want Russia destroyed to end their sales of fossil fuels. With such arrogance, perhaps the only way to wake up people in the West is to use at least a Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power, known as the “Father of All Bombs.” The yield is the equivalent of 44 tons of TNT. This bomb’s blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon. My sources insist that this weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim, but it is a Thermobaric weapon that sucks in the oxygen. Perhaps the only way to bring this to a head is to destroy Kiev. Drop the leaflets as the US did in Japan, telling the civilians to vacate immediately. Either they overthrow Zelensky and then seize control of their own country since he has suspended any election to retain dictatorial power and is the Hezbollah equivalent of Iran to NATO. Ukraine must be freed from the hands of NATO and American Neocons, or there will be NOTHING left to return to. Just look at this array. The computer is showing Ukraine has flat-lined into 2027. There is no victory. It will be totally destroyed thanks to this high-heel dancing proxy of NATO and the Neocons. This is not my opinion – it is FACT! Zelensky is completely drunk with power and is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Neocons, who want the total destruction of Russia. So, let’s get this straight. We should all sacrifice our future and that of our children all for the personal hatred of Russians by Zelensky and the Neocons. They always assume they will win, but their track record is clear – they have lost EVERY war since World War II. This war will not end until 2027 and there will be nothing left of Ukraine. So much for Zelensky’s Victory Plan. He is waging a Phyric War for a group of people who have lost every war against Russia since World War II. As for Question #1, to answer part one, yes, the Neocons orchestrated the usurpation of the White House in 2020 and marked a change in trend. This was a usurpation of American foreign policy by the Neocons. They have steered Kamala to take the White House to retain this usurpation of power. The rise of the Neocons and this thrust into World War III began with the 2020 Coup and the rigged election to secure ultimate power. STOP the BS about Trump, and look at the damn facts! Vote for abortion and Kamala while you support Blinken and World War III. Talk about being outright brainwashed and stupid! I have had dinner with people from the International Criminal Court. It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026. I suggest watching the Arrays on Ukraine for the specific people of risk. The computer clearly has gone flat line on Ukraine, and it will NOT exist post-2027.

Remove Putin, and you will get all out World War III with nukes, for those he has been restraining are the Russian Neocons, who are just as bad as ours in the West. We have to accept that those in power want World War III to (1) get out of debt, (2) reduce population, and (3) the climate change people want Russia destroyed to end their sales of fossil fuels. With such arrogance, perhaps the only way to wake up people in the West is to use at least a Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power, known as the “Father of All Bombs.” The yield is the equivalent of 44 tons of TNT. This bomb’s blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon. My sources insist that this weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim, but it is a Thermobaric weapon that sucks in the oxygen. Perhaps the only way to bring this to a head is to destroy Kiev. Drop the leaflets as the US did in Japan, telling the civilians to vacate immediately. Either they overthrow Zelensky and then seize control of their own country since he has suspended any election to retain dictatorial power and is the Hezbollah equivalent of Iran to NATO. Ukraine must be freed from the hands of NATO and American Neocons, or there will be NOTHING left to return to. Just look at this array. The computer is showing Ukraine has flat-lined into 2027. There is no victory. It will be totally destroyed thanks to this high-heel dancing proxy of NATO and the Neocons. This is not my opinion – it is FACT! Zelensky is completely drunk with power and is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Neocons, who want the total destruction of Russia. So, let’s get this straight. We should all sacrifice our future and that of our children all for the personal hatred of Russians by Zelensky and the Neocons. They always assume they will win, but their track record is clear – they have lost EVERY war since World War II. This war will not end until 2027 and there will be nothing left of Ukraine. So much for Zelensky’s Victory Plan. He is waging a Phyric War for a group of people who have lost every war against Russia since World War II. As for Question #1, to answer part one, yes, the Neocons orchestrated the usurpation of the White House in 2020 and marked a change in trend. This was a usurpation of American foreign policy by the Neocons. They have steered Kamala to take the White House to retain this usurpation of power. The rise of the Neocons and this thrust into World War III began with the 2020 Coup and the rigged election to secure ultimate power. STOP the BS about Trump, and look at the damn facts! Vote for abortion and Kamala while you support Blinken and World War III. Talk about being outright brainwashed and stupid! I have had dinner with people from the International Criminal Court. It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026.

This bomb’s blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon. My sources insist that this weapon is roughly as powerful as the Russians claim, but it is a Thermobaric weapon that sucks in the oxygen. Perhaps the only way to bring this to a head is to destroy Kiev. Drop the leaflets as the US did in Japan, telling the civilians to vacate immediately. Either they overthrow Zelensky and then seize control of their own country since he has suspended any election to retain dictatorial power and is the Hezbollah equivalent of Iran to NATO. Ukraine must be freed from the hands of NATO and American Neocons, or there will be NOTHING left to return to. Just look at this array. The computer is showing Ukraine has flat-lined into 2027. There is no victory. It will be totally destroyed thanks to this high-heel dancing proxy of NATO and the Neocons. This is not my opinion – it is FACT! Zelensky is completely drunk with power and is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Neocons, who want the total destruction of Russia. So, let’s get this straight. We should all sacrifice our future and that of our children all for the personal hatred of Russians by Zelensky and the Neocons. They always assume they will win, but their track record is clear – they have lost EVERY war since World War II. This war will not end until 2027 and there will be nothing left of Ukraine. So much for Zelensky’s Victory Plan. He is waging a Phyric War for a group of people who have lost every war against Russia since World War II. As for Question #1, to answer part one, yes, the Neocons orchestrated the usurpation of the White House in 2020 and marked a change in trend. This was a usurpation of American foreign policy by the Neocons. They have steered Kamala to take the White House to retain this usurpation of power. The rise of the Neocons and this thrust into World War III began with the 2020 Coup and the rigged election to secure ultimate power. STOP the BS about Trump, and look at the damn facts! Vote for abortion and Kamala while you support Blinken and World War III. Talk about being outright brainwashed and stupid! I have had dinner with people from the International Criminal Court. It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson So, let’s get this straight. We should all sacrifice our future and that of our children all for the personal hatred of Russians by Zelensky and the Neocons. They always assume they will win, but their track record is clear – they have lost EVERY war since World War II. This war will not end until 2027 and there will be nothing left of Ukraine. So much for Zelensky’s Victory Plan. He is waging a Phyric War for a group of people who have lost every war against Russia since World War II. As for Question #1, to answer part one, yes, the Neocons orchestrated the usurpation of the White House in 2020 and marked a change in trend. This was a usurpation of American foreign policy by the Neocons. They have steered Kamala to take the White House to retain this usurpation of power. The rise of the Neocons and this thrust into World War III began with the 2020 Coup and the rigged election to secure ultimate power. STOP the BS about Trump, and look at the damn facts! Vote for abortion and Kamala while you support Blinken and World War III. Talk about being outright brainwashed and stupid! I have had dinner with people from the International Criminal Court. It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026. I suggest watching the Arrays on Ukraine for the specific people of risk. The computer clearly has gone flat line on Ukraine, and it will NOT exist post-2027.

It is a joke. They do not have the jurisdiction to indict Putin any more than George Bush or Tony Blair. Suppose the ICC dared to arrest and put Putin on trial when they have no jurisdiction over every country that is not a member, which includes Russia, the USA, and China, and we dare pretend this is international law? This is political grandstanding. If they did such a thing, Russia would be justified in nuking Brussels. It would be acting against international law as a rouge agency out of control. The two presidents of Russia and Turkmenistan met at a meeting in Ashkhabat, Turkmenistan. Putin also met with the president of Iran. That was the first one-on-one meeting between the two leaders since the Iranian leader was elected in July. The American Neocons have not only divided the world economy with their sanctions that led to the formation of the BRICS, but they have forged an alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, who see the USA and NATO as a common enemy. Many in Asia are forming against the West, as is the case in the Middle East. Zelensky is such a traitor to his own people that he has American bodyguards, for he no longer trusts Ukrainians after the last coup attempt on May 7th, 2024, the precise day of our Economic Confidence Model. I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026. I suggest watching the Arrays on Ukraine for the specific people of risk. The computer clearly has gone flat line on Ukraine, and it will NOT exist post-2027.

I suppose dancing in high heels means you are qualified to make all the military decisions, just as having sex one time would qualify a man to be a gynecologist or perhaps write a book on how it “feels” to give birth to a child. Zelensky is going to be remembered as a modern-day Judas in history and also alongside Hitler for his support of the Nazi’s ethnic cleansing. He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026. I suggest watching the Arrays on Ukraine for the specific people of risk. The computer clearly has gone flat line on Ukraine, and it will NOT exist post-2027.

He made jokes before being president of confiscating assets from Jews and Russians. He married a Christian girl and had his children baptized, pretending he was not a Jew. Only after becoming president did he claim to be Jewish to distance himself from the Neo-Nazis ethnic cleansing of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and Jews. Like George Soros, who also pretended to be Christian and even confiscated assets from Jews, perhaps that is why Zelensky has also sold out Ukraine farmland to Blackrock. Zelensky knew when Russia would invade and not only made sure Putin would come in by the day before declaring he would rearm Ukraine with nuclear weapons, but he also did not warn the Ukrainian people. He told the Washington Post it would have cost him $7 billion if he warned the population. That decision along has cast a dark cloud over his character. My deep concern has been that the Revolutionary Cycle in Russia turns up in October. If Putin is overthrown or if he yields to the hardliners, we will see things start to get more aggressive. I believe he has now sent 100,000 troops to attack Ukraine. It looks like things will turn against Ukraine by May 2025 and it will probably be wiped out by 2026.

The protest became violent after he set security forces against the crowds. He then fled the country and was removed from office the the democratically elected parliament.That very day Nuland installed a succession of NATO quislings. Yanukovych's immediate successor was chosen by the parliament. There were then a national election in which Petro Poroshenko was elected, followed by the 2019 election which Zelensky won. Sorry, no CIA installation.By 2022 these DC goons were responsible for murdering 14,000 ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Again, it never happened. Pure Russian propaganda.After drawing a NATO red line in ‘22 Putin decided to take NATO’s war to NATO. No, Putin attacked because he thought that he would meet no resistance and could bring Ukraine back under Russian control. He attacked not because he feared NATO, but because he didn't.

That seems to be one of our ghost posters. One post in 2024, this thread. One post 2022, then trails off to 2017. FR commentators are neutral about Putin. We are rather opposed the constant stupidity, war-mongering, 50 year history of losing, and blatant corruption of US neocons and the deep-state. They have used your same idiotic Russian fear-mongering against Trump and American conservatives And when they and their Ukraine puppets are destroyed in their latest failure, they and your ilk will move on to some other asinine misadventure - probably Iran or Taiwan. They are in the process of destroying the United States.
