Yes. It’s still going on. Never-ending January continues, as we await the first post-Christmas pay cheque and the days to lengthen gradually into brightness. Restaurants across the city know that we particularly appreciate a bargain around now, and they equally want our custom at this quieter time. Here are some of the best offers currently running in the city from places new and old. So go on, grab your friends or family, try somewhere new or maybe just support your favourite spots. Achara burst on to the scene last year with bold, grilled Thai flavours that immediately had us all coming back for more. They offer €15 lunch special dishes, or their family-style early bird menu is available Monday-Friday, 5pm-6.30pm costing €25 per person with choices of basil chilli aubergine or Wagyu basil chilli beef krapao.

Recently, Big Mike’s launched a €22 “plat du jour” available every Friday and Saturday at lunchtime. Past offerings include roast duck ragù with taglierini, free-range pork schnitzel and hanger steak with chimichurri. What better way to kick start the weekend? Sometimes it’s not about special deals and offers. Sometimes a place simply does good value all the time. The weekday lunchtime menu at this smart pub has double smash burgers for €13 or steak frites with Irish rump steak for €16, while their loaded weekend roasts cost just €22. If you want Korean-style fried chicken, it’s hard to beat Chimac. They use only Irish free-range chicken in their addictively tasty dishes while their loaded fries and poutine round out the meal. A range of sauces, including the lip-smacking sriracha caramel, is available online and in selected stockists. Wednesdays in January and February give diners the chance to enjoy bottomless wings over 90 minutes for just €17.50.

However, they’ve consistently offered set value lunches and specials that are much more pocket-friendly. January offers a rump steak lunch with a side dish for €23 (Monday-Thursday, 12pm-5pm). The long-running express lunch menu has two or three courses for €31/€35 (Monday-Thursday, 12pm-3pm and 5pm-6pm; and Friday-Saturday, 12pm-6pm) while the BYOB Monday wine club offers €5 corkage all day.

Taco Tuesdays sees the great value offer of three taquitos for €10, accompanied by two-for-one margaritas. Vamos! Sister and brother team Brid and Colm Carter are the people behind H2G wines, an independent wine importer and wholesaler. Following a long stint at the now closed Honest2Goodness market in Glasnevin, they opened Mosaic, a local store that doubles as a wine bar with small plates. Until the end of February, customers can enjoy free corkage on Wednesdays and Thursdays, perfect for a midweek treat. Ever since eschewing a Michelin star, chef Oliver Dunne has focused on building up a busy restaurant group that consistently offers good value.

Read our full review here The spacious and elegant Dunmore has a neighbourhood menu which offers two or three courses for €31/€35, Tuesday-Thursday from 5pm-6.30pm.

Choose from Duncannon Quay mussels, the warming seafood pie or fire-roasted guinea fowl. Read our full review here For a Sunday treat, grab a gang and head to Ranelagh for the Exchequer’s hearty roast. Each meal serves four people and includes all trimmings plus a bottle of house wine. Prices start at €84.95 for chicken, while beef rib costs €99.95 and a whole suckling pig option is also available. Roasts must be ordered two days in advance (a week for the suckling pig), but that’s the only hard work needed as chef José and team will take care of everything else. Known for its glamorous interior, The Ivy is offering seriously good value on wine right now with half price on all bottles every Wednesday-Friday this January. There are no catches, with all wines included. Combine with the January set menu which has one or two courses for €23.95/€29.95 on Monday-Friday from 11.30am-6pm.

On Sundays-Tuesdays, you can choose any wine from the extensive collection lining the walls and enjoy for just €1 corkage. Following the closure of the much-missed Headline bar, veteran restaurateurs Máire and Geoff Ní Mhaoile relocated to Terenure and promptly set about creating yet another neighbourhood treasure. Their warm hospitality and focus on getting the basics right has seen them build a strong local following, and now they are offering their two-course, €34 early bird menu all day every Friday and Saturday. Read our full review here Yves returns to Ranelagh on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays with a French-influenced set-price sharing menu for €37.95. Mix and match dishes such as gravlax, potato bombs with beef bourguignon ragù or slow roast pork belly with lentils, and enjoy with free corkage throughout January and February – especially with the excellent Redmonds off-licence next door.

Title: ‘It was glamorous, and we thought it would last forever’ – curtain falls on Paddy Cole, king of the swingers

From hanging with Elvis to dodging Roy Rogers’ calls, the seasoned saxophonist’s life was simply epic Showband legend Paddy Cole Helen and Paddy Cole Paddy Cole and Butch Moore Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal In April 2022, before the funeral of Dickie Rock’s wife Judy in Rathfarnham, Paddy Cole told me he had just been diagnosed with incurable lung cancer. He battled it with bravery and courage for the best part of three years, succumbing last week at the age of 85. Cole was a legend in the Irish entertainment industry and one of the country’s most respected musicians. His professional career playing Dixieland jazz began at the age of 12 in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, and lasted until his cancer diagnosis. He also gave rise to one of the great anecdotes in Irish showbusiness, first told by Kevin Marron in the Sunday World. While doing a residency in Las Vegas, members of his band, the Big 8 showband, became friendly with their boyhood hero, Roy Rogers — a famous TV cowboy with a horse called Trigger. One night, Rogers had gone to their gig, and was so taken with the band that he invited them to his ranch. In time, the friendship became slightly irksome for the Irish band — and Marron was in Paddy’s apartment for dinner when the phone rang. As his wife Helen went to answer it, Paddy shouted: “If that’s Roy Rogers, tell him I’m not in.” The anecdote gave rise to the title of a biography of Cole by journalist Tim Ryan. Paddy was a very decent man with an easy charm and ready smile, who formed friendships all over the world, from celebrities and VIPs to ordinary folk who admired him for his expertise on the saxophone and clarinet and his genuine love of life and music. He also engaged in many charitable enterprises and was voluntary chairman of the royalty-collection agency Recorded Artists, Actors and Performers (RAAP), as well as presenting a well-received weekly radio programme on Sunshine FM. In an RTÉ recording of Open House, singer Joe Dolan summed him up: “I’ve never heard Paddy say anything rude about anybody or talk behind anyone’s back… he’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime.” He’s just one of those lovely people that come around once in a lifetime Paddy Cole was born into a musical family in Henry Street, Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, on December 17, 1939, the second in a family of seven children. His father, also Paddy, worked for the post office and played saxophone with the local Regal Dance Band and later the Maurice Lynch Orchestra. “I often think back about my dad and I admire him a lot for working day and night,” he said in his autobiography, King of the Swingers, written with Tom Gilmore. “He was with the post office, driving a mail van, delivering letters and parcels to sub-post offices every morning, as well as being a musician by night.” Butch Moore and the Capitol, with Paddy Cole in the back row His mother, Mary Hughes, also from a musical family in Castleblayney, was the mainstay of the family and encouraged her son from an early age. Listening to old 78rpm records on the gramophone, he became a fan of New Orleans jazz – something that would last his lifetime and make him a handsome living. Billed as “12-year-old Paddy Cole, Ireland’s youngest saxophone player”, he played his first professional gig with his father in Maurice Lynch’s band, just on the cusp of what became known as the showband era. While still at vocational school in Castleblayney, he rushed from classes to the band’s van waiting outside the school gates, collecting him for gigs. “We were doing a cross-section of everything — a variety of music to suit all tastes,” he said, from Bill Haley’s Rock Around The Clock to Irish ballads and Glenn Miller dance tunes. But there was also pressure on him to get a steady job, in case the music didn’t work out. He worked as a petrol-pump attendant, an apprentice electrician and a butcher. But the music of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and others held him in thrall. With the advent of the showband boom and the money that it brought to rural Ireland, there was a demand for good musicians. Two young agriculture students, Eamonn Monaghan and Des Kelly, had formed the Capitol Showband, and in 1961 they came calling on Cole, with an offer of £30 a week. Paddy shrugged off obscurity to play all over the country in parish halls and the new ballrooms that were springing up. “It was glamorous, and we were enjoying it all, even if we weren’t that conscious of how good the music was. We thought it would go on forever,” he said. His first gig with the Capitol was at the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, Co Louth. “It was so hectic in those early days with the Capitol that there wasn’t even time to think,” he said. There were concerts all over Ireland and Britain, some before crowds of 4,000 people. The band did a programme on Radio Luxembourg, and recorded with Phil Coulter at the Tommy Ellis Studio in Dublin, and did publicity work for newspapers and magazines. Their big break came when Belfast-born promoter Phil Solomon brought the band to London to record Sunday Night at the London Palladium, a huge televised variety show with an audience of millions. Solomon, who also recorded Van Morrison and The Dubliners, wanted the Capitol to be the show’s house band — and was miffed when they turned it down. They were also the first Irish showband to go to the US, in 1961, at a time when there was no music or dancing during the Catholic season of Lent in De Valera’s Ireland. The band had three number one hits in 1964-65 with Down Came the Rain, Born to Be with You and Walking the Streets in the Rain, which had been Ireland’s entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, sung by Butch Moore. Helen and Paddy Cole While playing a dance in Newcastle West, Paddy met a “fabulous-looking girl” – who a week or two later, he spotted walking along Westmoreland Street in Dublin. She was Helen Hehir. The couple married in February 1965, but had to cut their honeymoon in Marbella short when Paddy got a call to get over to London to record for The Eamonn Andrews Show and Thank Your Lucky Stars. When Butch Moore got an offer “he couldn’t refuse” and left the Capitol, the showband scene was coming to an end. Paddy Cole got a phone call to see if he would join the Big 8 with Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy. The Big 8 spent six months of the year doing a Las Vegas residency at the Stardust. “It was hard work,” he told Tom Gilmore for King of the Swingers. “We were doing three shows a night, six nights a week and each show was an hour long.” But there was time off too, and Paddy recalled meeting Elvis Presley and attending Frank Sinatra’s legendary concerts in Caesars Palace. Although they loved the lifestyle and climate of Nevada, the Coles returned to Ireland in 1974 and Paddy decided to leave the Big 8 — announcing it through the pages of the Evening Press, much to the annoyance of band leaders Brendan Bowyer and Tom Dunphy, and of manager TJ Byrne. Cole, who had been teetotal in the early years, started “drinking a few bottles of Guinness” after shows, which became more than a few bottles as time wore on. He admitted to Gilmore that he was at this stage “a bad drinker”, ending up after gigs drinking late into the night with people he didn’t know, asking himself the following morning why he was doing it. After he had some nodules removed from his throat, he was told by his surgeon not to drink alcohol for five weeks — and he never did. “It was no big deal,” he once told me, “I never went to AA meetings or anything like that. But to be honest, it was then I realised that people attending my gigs were buying me so many pints… "While it was my policy never to drink before going on stage, I felt at the jazz gigs that I had to have a pint from time to time. But I never drank after that cancer scare, and it changed my life.” After stints with the Paddy Cole Band and the Paddy Cole Superstars, he bought a pub in Castleblayney, named it Paddy Cole’s Place — and moved home. Due to back trouble he had to stop performing, and was eventually “sacked” from his own band and given a sinecure working in the office. He credited the singer Twink with “bushwhacking” him into cabaret and after that he became a staple on the scene, playing with her on stage and television shows. Reunion tours with the Capitol, The Showband Show and cabaret gigs at Clontarf Castle, the Braemor Rooms, the Harcourt Hotel plus gigs all over the country, kept him busy as a musician for the rest of his life. After selling the pub, the Coles moved to a Victorian home in Ballsbridge, Dublin. Like many musicians he suffered from financial insecurity, which led in 2006 to him making a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for €834,726 in relation to off-shore bank accounts — probably the one embarrassing blot on his long career in showbusiness. Paddy Cole with former Sunday Independent editor Aengus Fanning. Photo: Julien Behal While not playing music, Cole was a keen golfer and member of the prestigious Lahinch Golf Club in Co Clare. “I cringe when I hear that word ‘retirement’,” he told one interviewer. “I want to ease back a bit and pick and choose where and when I’ll play. But there’s an old saying: ‘You don’t stop because you get old; but you get old because you stop’ — and that’s why I won’t be stopping.” He put it another way to an old showbusiness acquaintance. “When you have somebody offering you €5,000 for a couple of hours’ work doing something you really love, you’d be stone mad to say no.” Sadly, when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, he had to stop. One of his great regrets was no longer being able to play sax or clarinet. But he faced his illness with his usual grace, joking from his hospital bed that there was so much fluid on his lungs that “I need a plumber, not a surgeon.” One of his favourite haunts was Gleesons pub in Booterstown, Co Dublin, where he would meet with friends for coffee, particularly Éanna Casey who worked with him in the musician’s royalty organisations RAAP. Among his many lifelong pals were musician Eamonn Monaghan and comedian Noel V Ginnity and a host of others, including businessman Mick Sherry who drove him to and from hospital appointments. Paddy Cole, who died last Wednesday, is survived by his wife Helen and children Karen, Paddy and Pierce. His funeral mass takes place in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan, at 12 noon tomorrow.

Title: Davos calls for cooperation amid global challenges

People attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 23, 2025. (Xinhua/Lian Yi) Amid uncertainties, cooperation remains essential to advancing global economy and WEF participants have expressed optimism about China's economic prospects and contribution to driving global recovery. DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- In the face of global uncertainties, cooperation remains essential to advance the global economy and foster sustainable growth, said participants at the five-day World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting, which concluded on Friday in Davos, Switzerland. China's steady economic growth, marked by a 5 percent increase in 2024, has provided significant momentum to the global economy. WEF participants expressed confidence and optimism regarding China's economic prospects and contributions to global economic recovery. UNCERTAINTIES AHEAD While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slightly revised its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 3.3 percent, uncertainties and uneven growth remain key concerns. During the annual meeting, politicians, leaders of international organizations, and business executives warned that protectionism and decoupling could severely undermine global economic growth and prosperity. Trade protectionism has begun to resurge, Fred Hu, founder and chairman of Primavera Capital Group, told Xinhua during the WEF annual meeting, adding that it once triggered a global economic depression. "Historical lessons have fully demonstrated that the path of protectionism is not sustainable," Hu said. Voicing strong opposition to protectionism, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, said, "This will not really benefit anyone." The WEF's Chief Economists Outlook report, released before the opening of the annual meeting, revealed that more than half of surveyed economists expect the global economy to weaken over the next year. Their concerns stem from growing trade protectionism, global economic fragmentation, public debt and persistently high inflation. Rising unilateralism and protectionism are intensifying geopolitical and economic fragmentation, while trade enhances the efficiency and dynamism of the global economy. The strain on multilateralism makes effective global cooperation more urgent than ever.

(Xinhua/Peng Ziyang) GLOBAL COOPERATION In his closing remarks, WEF President Borge Brende said the world is at a time of immense consequence and uncertainty. "Political, geopolitical, and macroeconomic landscape -- all are shifting under our feet," he said. Critical priorities such as driving economic growth, reducing carbon emissions, and finding ways to end conflicts require urgent attention, he said. "All of these challenges cannot wait, and the only way to make progress on these issues is by working together." "Prosperity is indivisible. I can't prosper unless you are prospering," Singaporean President Tharman Shanmugaratnam said at the "Global Economic Outlook" session on Friday. "No nation, even the largest, will prosper unless the rest of the world is prospering," he said. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also highlighted that the evolving geopolitical landscape will reshape trade and economic relations, leading to more regional cooperation and supply chain-based collaboration. "I think there is no way we can wipe out collaboration from the future of humanity," she said. "Advancing global innovation, health, prosperity and resilience cannot be done alone. Leaders will need new mechanisms for working together on key priorities, even as they disagree on others, and the past several years have shown this balance is possible," said Bob Sternfels, global managing partner of McKinsey.

(Photo by Geng Yuhe/Xinhua) CHINA'S CONTRIBUTIONS China's economic development garnered significant attention at the annual meeting, with participants expressing confidence in its growth prospects. Hu noted that China's economic fundamentals are constantly improving and China's capital market is full of opportunities. Though China's economy faces challenges in the short term, it still has many bright spots in the fields of manufacturing, new energy industry, consumer spending and technological innovation, he said. China's high-quality economic development over the past few decades has injected momentum into global economic growth, and China will continue to be an "important engine" for driving global economic growth in the future, Hu said. Joe Ngai, chairman of McKinsey & Company in Greater China, reaffirmed his confidence in China's economic fundamentals, describing the market as "full of opportunities and worthy of investment by global companies." China's advancements in technology, including its rapid progress in artificial intelligence, drew widespread attention at the annual meeting. Chen Liming, chair of Greater China for the WEF, highlighted China's contributions to global AI governance and its active collaboration with international organizations to share insights and foster cooperation. "If you look at China, its entrepreneurialism, its development, Europe needs to be in the same footing," said Laurence Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of BlackRock, an asset management firm.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against the other stocks. Even though the year 2024 was not kind to certain sectors within the US economy, the broader outlook for the stock market heading into the new year was more than rosy. Investment banks generally anticipated moderate economic growth for the US in 2025. For example, Deutsche Bank forecasts a growth rate of approximately 2%, noting that 2025 will not be a year of rapid GDP growth. Meanwhile, JP Morgan's Global Investment Strategy team emphasized a foundation of strength stemming from 2024's robust market returns. They highlighted themes such as easing global policies and rising capital investment as key drivers for the coming year. Their report, Outlook 2025: Building on Strength, suggested that the US economy was well-positioned to capitalize on these favorable conditions.

Top economic experts project that inflation rates will decelerate in 2025, approaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target by the second half of the year. This outlook suggests a stabilization of price levels, which could influence monetary policy decisions. US Bank Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino offered insights into the Federal Reserve's anticipated actions. She predicted that the Fed would implement two interest rate cuts in 2025, citing continued economic strength. Bovino also noted that proposed tariffs and tax cuts by the new administration could exert additional inflationary pressures, potentially complicating the Fed's policy decisions. The fiscal policies of the new administration are expected to play a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. Bank of America analysts Claudio Irigoyen and Aditya Bhave discussed the interplay between US policy changes and the global economy. They anticipated that fiscal policy would be expansionary through tax cuts and acknowledged that proposed tariff increases could have a modest impact on consumer price inflation. Their analysis underscored the importance of balancing growth initiatives with inflation control. In terms of sector performance, Standard Chartered Bank expressed optimism about equities and commodities. Entering 2025, the bank was overweight in equities and gold, citing a resilient global economy with a projected GDP growth of 3%.

Title: BlackRock Ethereum Holdings Surpass 1.2 Million ETH Amidst Strong Institutional Adoption – Details

Ethereum (ETH) declined by 5.68% in the last week in line with the majority of the crypto market. The prominent altcoin currently trades around $3,290 as investors await the crypto bull run’s return to form. On the other hand, rising institutional adoption provides a positive development for the Ethereum community. According to a recent X post by Burak Kesmeci, Ethereum is currently experiencing a surge in institutional adoption as evidenced by developments in the Spot ETF Market. Kesmeci highlights that BlackRock’s ETHA accounts for the majority of this demand with net assets of 1.2009 ETH valued at over $3.19 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, this record is largely unsurprising as ETHA has experienced the highest net cumulative inflows of $3.97 billion in the Ethereum Spot ETF market. Fidelity’s FETH occupies second place with 432,750 ETH valued at around $1.46 billion. Bitwise’s ETHW and VanEck’s ETHV follow with holdings of 105,974 ETH and 45,766 ETH, respectively. Meanwhile, all other Ethereum Spot ETFs except the Grayscale ETHE have accumulated at least 7,000 ETH since their launch in July 2024. A rise in institutional demand of Ethereum as Indicated by the data above indicates strong confidence in the asset’s long-term profitability. While Ethereum Spot ETFs may not replicate the performance of Bitcoin counterparts, the institutional demand these funds command could enhance ETH market stability and liquidity, paving the way for broader regulatory acceptance and mainstream adoption. In other news, bearish sentiments currently prove dominant in the ETH market as dominated by a higher proportion of short-term transactions to long transactions. According to Kesmeci, short orders represent 57% of all Ethereum futures trades indicating that the majority of traders are betting the altcoin to experience a further price decline. This negative development is particularly observed on the Bitmex and Bitfinex exchanges. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,297 after 0.17% loss in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume has dipped by 24.24% and is now valued at $25.36 billion. Based on its daily trading chart, Ethereum appears to be consolidating despite recent losses. With any price rally, the altcoin could reach around $3,700, moving past which would spur a return to around $4,000. On the other hand, another fall in Ethereum’s price could result in a slump to around $3,100, which lies its next significant support level. With a market cap of $396.85 billion, ETH retains its position as the largest altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

Title: BlackRock Files To Change Its Bitcoin ETF To Allow For In-Kind Redemptions — Good News For BTC?

Asset management giant BlackRock is pushing for a significant update to its spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, to allow in-kind redemptions rather than just for cash. Authorized participants, aka large institutional investors, would be able to buy and redeem shares of the ETF directly in Bitcoin. This model is deemed more efficient as it lets authorized participants closely observe the demand for the fund and act swiftly by buying or selling shares of the ETF without being obliged to sell the BTC through a market maker and deliver cash. Initially, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT with cash-only redemption, but this proposed update reflects a move toward bigger integration of Bitcoin in institutional ETF operations. “It should have been approved in the first place, but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart observed on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” According to a Jan. 24 amended rule filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nasdaq proposed “to allow for in-kind transfers of the Trust’s Bitcoin.” This in-kind model is more efficient for ETFs as it avoids bid spreads and broker commissions from selling the basket to raise cash for issuing shares. Notably, retail investors won’t have access to the in-kind redemption model as they will only be eligible to participate in the cash model. Only authorized participants willl be able to do in-kind redemptions and creations. “The main point is that the in-kind model is way more streamlined with less steps and less parties involved (and its how the vast majority of ETFs operate),” Seyffart explained. BlackRock now holds an astounding $60 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in its iShares Bitcoin Trust, an impressive feat reached just one year after going live on Wall Street. This represents about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin has positioned it among the biggest institutional holders of the premier cryptocurrency, even usurping MicroStrategy’s well-known cache. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also recently sparked excitement among market participants after speculating a BTC price target of as high as $700,000 if more institutions adopt it. He has been talking with sovereign wealth funds about allocating 2% to 5% of their assets to Bitcoin, which indicates that even entities that usually avoid risk are becoming interested amid President Donald Trump’s return to the White House for his second term.

Title: No more number 13 bus to Ballymun as route set to end at Mountjoy Square

Another recognisable Dublin bus route, the number 13 serving Ballymun, will change this weekend, when bus services in the north Dublin suburb are taken over by routes under the Bus Connects network. Route 13 has had a long association with Ballymun and until Saturday of this week ran between Grange Castle in west Dublin and Harristown, close to Dublin Airport. The last bus into each terminus is scheduled for 11.30pm on Saturday night. From Sunday there will still be a route 13 but its northern terminus is to be Mountjoy Square in Dublin’s north inner city. The route will still connect with Grange Castle via O’Connell Street, the south City, Kimmage, Bluebell and Clondalkin. The changes are part of the introduction this Sunday of phase 6a of the National Transport Authority’s Bus Connects network. Under the plan, Route 13 is to continue in name but the northern leg of the route will be dropped. Ballymun will in future be covered by the Bus Connects E-Spine routes E1 and E2 – which are both 24-hour routes. The E1 runs from Northwood, which is north of Ballymun, taking in DCU and the city centre to Ballywaltrim, which is south of Bray, Co Wicklow. The E2 runs from Harristown near Dublin Airport, taking in DCU, the city centre and terminating in Dún Laoghaire. Two other routes, route 4 and route 11, will also survive the changes, albeit with amendments. From Sunday route 4 from Monkstown will be diverted at O’Connell Bridge to Heuston Station. Route 11 from Sandyford will be diverted at Parnell Square to run via Phibsborough and the North Circular Road to the Phoenix Park. Radial route 19 from Dublin Airport via DCU to the city centre will initially operate to and from Parnell Square, and to and from Merrion Square at peak times. An all-day service to and from Merrion Square will commence in April. Routes being replaced from Sunday as part of phase 6a include the 46A, 46E, 63, 63A, 84, 84A, 84x, 143, 144, 145, 155, 184 and 185. [ Goodbye to the 46A: End of legendary Dublin bus route made famous in songOpens in new window ] Kilcoole and Newcastle in Co Wicklow will in future be served by the X1 and X2 routes, respectively. The service will be between North Wicklow and Dublin city centre. In addition a number of short-hop, local services will be introduced around north Co Wicklow and south Co Dublin feeding into local schools, Dart and Luas lines. These include local routes around Delgany, Enniskerry, Greystones and Bray, some routes within Bray and some routes across south Co Dublin. The L26 will link Kilternan to Cornelscourt and on to Blackrock Dart station; while the L27 will link Leopardstown Valley with Cornelscourt and Dún Laoghaire. A full list of the new services is available at transportforireland.ie. Tim O'Brien is an Irish Times journalist © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Investors shouldn't complain, though, after an action-packed start to the week led the coin to hit a new high. The price of the biggest coin by market cap broke a new record of $108,786 Monday ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration. It has since dropped by nearly 4%, CoinGecko shows. And despite President Trump not explicitly declaring plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve in his first crypto executive order, the coin is still sitting comfortably above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin soared above $100,000 following Trump's November election; the President promised to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry. And he is keeping his crypto promises—albeit while annoying some hardcore Bitcoiners in the process. Money continued to flow into the crypto investment vehicles this week, after investors threw billions at the funds last week ahead of the inauguration. But it didn't stop, with $802.6 million hitting the funds on Tuesday alone, data from Farside Investors shows. By the end of the week, over $1.75 billion worth of assets had entered the Bitcoin ETFs. The bullishness comes as Donald Trump is expected to be a net positive for the industry. The Republican campaigned on a promise to help the industry and now buying Bitcoin has never been easier thanks to the funds. The spot bitcoin ETFs quietly on fire to start year, with $4.2b in flows which is 6% of all ETF flows. Now at +$40b net since launch with aum at $121b and return of 127%. For context they just passed ESG ETFs in assets ($117b) and have about same as gold spot. pic.twitter.com/GADOomLXD4 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 24, 2025 Bitcoiners had been waiting for it for years. And on Tuesday, President Donald Trump kept his campaign promise to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of the dark web e-commerce site—mainly used for buying drugs using Bitcoin—was released shortly after and expressed enormous gratitude to President Trump. The crypto community flooded his digital wallets with BTC donations, too. But Ulbricht—who went to prison in 2013—might already just be sitting on a goldmine: Untouched Bitcoin wallets linked to Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road now hold over $47 million worth of the asset. Ulbricht has long been considered a hero in the Bitcoin community for creating one of the first marketplaces to accept the cryptocurrency. And though it still can't be verified that the wallets do indeed belong to him, it's not beyond the realm of possibility. Ahead of Donald Trump's shock November 5 win, the President had promised plans for a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But after signing his first crypto executive order on Thursday, which touched on the possibility of a crypto stockpile, Bitcoiners noticed one thing—there was no mention of their beloved orange coin, just "digital assets." "The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts," the order read. The news has angered ardent Bitcoiners, who have been hurling the usual insults about "shitcoinery," and who think it may lead the government to building up a stash of other digital coins. Emergency Press Conference: Ripple is undermining American prosperity, freedom, and Bitcoin. Ripple is actively lobbying to stop a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. while pushing their centralized, corporate-controlled token. We will not stand for it. pic.twitter.com/EHldJHxyR9 — Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) January 24, 2025 Software company MicroStrategy shareholders are seemingly all-in on the firm's Bitcoin strategy: They on Tuesday voted for a 30x increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares so that the company could have more resources to buy the cryptocurrency. The news came as the company announced its latest Bitcoin buy, bringing its holdings to 461,000 Bitcoin—worth over $48 billion. And on Friday, the firm said that it would redeem over $1 billion worth of its existing debt accumulated early while building up the stash. Elsewhere, British multinational bank Standard Chartered, which has come out with very bullish predictions in the past, said in a Wednesday note that Bitcoin would continue to soar as pension funds enter the space. Analysts at the bank forecasted that institutions enthusiasm for the asset could mean the coin hits $200,000 by the end of 2025. But there were even bigger price predictions for Bitcoin from major players this week. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that growing adoption could push the price of the asset to $700,000, while Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong projected a price in the "multiple millions" at some undetermined point in the future.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Building a great investment portfolio and, therefore, wealth takes a lot of patience and time. Portfolios can also take many shapes depending on the investor’s goals and purpose. For some, it’s all about chasing high-risk, high-reward opportunities, which promise quicker returns, while for other investors, it’s about a steadier approach focusing on dividend payments and long-term growth. Both strategies have benefits and again, the right one depends on the investor’s goals, risk appetite and time horizon. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. One investor recently shared his journey and explained how he turned $3.50 per hour investments into a $4.4 million portfolio in over 35 years. While his approach relied heavily on dividends and closed-end funds, a major key to his success involved making bold moves on risky stocks like IMMU (Immunomedics) and SAVA (Cassava Sciences). He held IMMU stocks for decades and sold them at the right time, generating $2.2 million for his portfolio, which shows how long-term strategies and perhaps a bit of luck can pay off big. “Started at $3.50 per hour. Went back to school in my early 30s, as did my wife. Definitely no inheritance and student loans to boot. Just 35 years of investing. [...] Got lucky with IMMU buyout after riding that one (in and out) for ~30 years,” the investor said. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Now, he’s planning on shifting gears to more conservative, balanced, high-yield stocks that pay dividends. With his holdings allocated to 150 different stocks, his top 10 favorites make up 25% of his $300K annual dividends. These picks include a combination of dividend-growth stocks, closed-end funds and high-risk plays and he’s shared them in a thread in Reddit’s r/dividends community. Let’s closely examine his top 10 stock picks and why they appeal to so many investors. Investor With $300K in Dividends and a $4.4 Million Portfolio Shares His Top 10 Stocks BSTZ (BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II) BSTZ is a closed-end fund focusing on tech innovation, such as AI, robotics and biotech. With a current dividend yield of 10.04%, this pick is a favorite among investors who want high yields and seek growth and exposure to advanced industries. JRI (Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth Fund) JRI invests in assets like real estate and infrastructure, offering buyers diversification and a hedge against inflation. With a dividend yield of around 7.89%, JRI charms many investors, especially those close to or already retired and those looking for stability. Trending: It’s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art — this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%. Here’s how everyday investors are getting started. DSL (DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund) DSL specializes in global fixed-income securities, such as high-yield bonds and new market debt. Its current dividend yield is 10.17%. Investors buy DSL because of its high dividend rate and diversification across assets. NRO (Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund) Boasting a 10.75% dividend yield, NRO offers access to real estate securities, primarily REITs, which generate returns through property income. KYN (Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund) KYN invests in energy infrastructure acquisitions, including pipelines and storage facilities. With a 9.97% dividend yield, this fund appeals to investors seeking income and exposure to a traditionally high-yielding industry. HIO (Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund) As a high-yield bond fund created for income generation, HIO offers a dividend gain of 9.50% and appeals to investors due to its substantial profits in fixed-income securities. See Also: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! IDE (Voya Infrastructure, Industrials and Materials Fund) With a dividend yield of 8.94%, IDE specializes in infrastructure and industrial sectors, providing investors with insight into essential services, such as materials and transportation. MO (Altria Group) MO is a leader in the tobacco sector and offers a 9.91% dividend yield. The group has a strong cash flow, is a reliable dividend stock as per investors and is a good choice for many because it offers diversification into alternative products. ARCC (Ares Capital Corporation) ARCC is a business development company that offers financing to mid-sized companies and offers a dividend yield of 9.91%. Investors who want to benefit from the expansion of private companies find ARCC a good buy. HYT (BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund) With dividend returns of 9.43% currently, HYT invests in a portfolio of corporate high-yield bonds. The fund’s focus on offering regular income and a buffer against market volatility makes it a favorite for many investors. The changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider. For instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets. With payment priority and flexible liquidity options, the Ascent Income Fund is a cornerstone investment vehicle for income-focused investors.

Title: Bitcoin Price Driven by Large Investors: Details

U.Today - Large investors have been driving Bitcoin price gains since the U.S. election, with their holdings increasing from 16.2 million to 16.4 million BTC, according to data from CryptoQuant. In contrast, small investors reduced their holdings from 1.75 million to 1.69 million BTC during the same period. Bitcoin ETFs are now the largest holders of the flagship cryptocurrency. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in existence have collectively passed $100 billion in assets under management, one of the most successful ETF launches in history. The funds now own slightly more than 1.1 million Bitcoin, equivalent to about 5% of all the Bitcoin in existence. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now own more of the cryptocurrency than legendary pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto, who is believed to control as much as 1.1 million Bitcoin. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed a remarkable $60 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), holding 574,118.84380 BTC on its balance sheet. Recent data from Farside Investors reveals that Bitcoin ETFs have seen total inflows of $188.7 million, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) accounting for $154.6 million of that — making up 81% of the net inflows. The legendary finance analyst Tom Lee thinks Bitcoin price can go as high as $250,000 in 2025. The potential for the U.S. to legitimize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset dramatically enhances its long-term price outlook, said Lee. Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the best-case scenario for the BTC price in the next 12 months. “Over the next 12 months, I believe something in the range of $250,000 is possible — perhaps even highly probable, based on the current price cycle,” he said. Another seasoned trader Peter Brandt maintains his less optimistic 2025 BTC price target of $135,000. Nonetheless, with the current Bitcoin market cap of $2 trillion, it's likely that the BTC rally will continue in 2025. This article was originally published on U.Today

Bitcoin has surged since the election of U.S. president Donald Trump last year, soaring on hopes Trump could be about to trigger a bitcoin game-changer. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has rocketed past $100,000 per bitcoin, hitting a fresh all-time high ahead of Trump's inauguration as the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock reveals sovereign wealth funds are exploring bitcoin. Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a fresh dollar crisis, the chief executive of major bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase has predicted when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong has issued a huge bitcoin price prediction, forecasting ... [+] bitcoin could flip gold by 2030. "Any country with gold reserves should be holding at least 11% of that amount in bitcoin reserves," Armstrong posted to X in response to criticism of Trump's plan for a national bitcoin reserve. "And I believe in the next five to 10 years bitcoin's market cap will likely surpass gold. So these reserves should grow to exceed gold." This week, Trump has followed through on his campaign promises to make overhauling crypto policy one of his administration's priorities, ordering the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing new regulations and exploring the creation of a national cryptocurrency stockpile. The group will "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." The U.S. currently holds more than 200,000 bitcoin worth around $21 billion along with some smaller cryptocurrencies that have been seized by law enforcement. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $18 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Armstrong has endorsed the idea of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, calling it part of a plan that will "bring economic freedom to the world" that comes at a "pivotal moment" in history. "The next global arms race will be in the digital economy, not space," Armstrong wrote. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed to a record high in 2025, triggering a wave of bullish bitcoin price ... [+] predictions. "Bitcoin could be as foundational to the global economy as gold and will become central to national security in a world where holdings of bitcoin can shift the balance of power among nation states. Governments will race to build strategic bitcoin reserves, securing and uplifting their national economies while those without will lose their footing in the digital age." Meanwhile, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Armstrong predicted the bitcoin price will top "multiple millions" as the U.S. bitcoin reserve causes the "rest of the G20" to follow suit. "If the U.S. took that path, probably the rest of the G20 would follow," said. "I think bitcoin has a long way to go—it's going to be the new gold standard out there, but crypto is really much bigger than that too." One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s Top 15 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) stands against other Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks. Mario Gabelli is a legendary American investor, renowned for his expertise in value investing and his focus on media, telecommunications, and consumer goods. As the founder and CEO of GAMCO Investors, Gabelli has built a storied career, consistently delivering strong returns for investors while amassing significant wealth. He was born in 1942 in Italy to a family of modest means. His father was a schoolteacher, and the Gabelli family immigrated to the United States when Mario was a child. Settling in the Bronx, Gabelli became fluent in English while excelling academically. He attended Columbia Business School, where he earned his MBA. Gabelli’s early career began at Lyon, Lavey, and Bessemer, where he worked as a financial analyst before moving to Tudor Investment Corporation in the late 1960s. At Tudor, Gabelli developed a deep interest in media and entertainment stocks, recognizing that these sectors were undervalued and ripe for investment. Gabelli’s early years in finance provided him with a solid foundation in analyzing companies, market trends, and financial statements. In 1976, Gabelli founded Gabelli & Company — which would later become Gabelli Asset Management and then GAMCO Investors — with the goal of applying his value investing philosophy to select, often underappreciated companies. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Under Gabelli’s stewardship, the firm has delivered above-market returns, with Gabelli’s flagship Gabelli Equity Fund returning an average annualized return of 13% over several decades. Gabelli is an ardent advocate of value investing, a strategy pioneered by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis, buying companies at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and holding them for the long term. One of Gabelli’s most notable achievements was his early recognition of the potential in media companies. He was one of the first investors to spot the potential of CBS, Time Warner, and Viacom, turning those investments into massive successes. Gabelli is particularly well-known for his focus on the telecommunications sectors as well. He has invested in companies like Comcast, Disney, and Liberty Media, often advocating for management changes and strategic restructuring to unlock value.

The company continued to attract large numbers of new premium card members with 3.3 million new card acquisitions while maintaining high retention rates, excellent credit performance, and expense discipline. Secondly, American Express (NYSE:AXP) has introduced new initiatives to support low-carbon communities, including the expansion of its carbon footprint tool for select corporate clients. Moreover, the company has announced new product updates and analytics enhancements to its digital cash flow management hub, American Express Business Blueprint, which would help small business card members understand their cash flow trends in a better way. Overall, AXP ranks 6th on our list of Billionaire Mario Gabelli’s top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AXP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: With 89% ownership in Halma plc (LON:HLMA), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-halma-plc-lon-085501207.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Halma's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions 48% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders A look at the shareholders of Halma plc (LON:HLMA) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Last week’s 4.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Halma, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Halma Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. Halma already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Halma's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Halma. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 4.8% of common stock, and FMR LLC holds about 3.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that Halma plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own UK£7.7m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Halma. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that Halma is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: Institutional owners may take dramatic actions as Greggs plc's (LON:GRG) recent 5.6% drop adds to one-year losses

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Greggs' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 18 shareholders own 51% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock If you want to know who really controls Greggs plc (LON:GRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 88% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by UK£126m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 18% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as "smart money", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Greggs, which might have negative implications on individual investors. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Greggs. View our latest analysis for Greggs Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Greggs. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Greggs' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Greggs is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.3% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Fiduciary Management, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Greggs plc in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own UK£2.0m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Greggs. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Greggs better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that Greggs is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

Title: An Irishwoman’s story of travelling abroad for cosmetic surgery
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/2025/01/25/an-irishwomans-story-of-travelling-abroad-for-cosmetic-surgery/

There’s something ironic about actor Demi Moore leaving this month’s Golden Globes ceremony with a statuette for her performance as the fading celebrity who succumbs to the ultimate anti-ageing injectable along with an award-ceremony goody bag containing a voucher for a $40,000 cellular facelift. Body-horror film The Substance and its terrifying message about the Faustian deal Moore’s character Elisabeth Sparkle makes to freeze time, may have made a visceral impression on audiences, but it’s unlikely to halt the rise of cosmetic surgery. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery’s annual global survey, both aesthetic and cosmetic procedures are growing year on year, with a 40 per cent increase over the past five years. Liposuction is the most common surgical procedure, followed by breast augmentation, eyelid surgery, abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and rhinoplasty. While there are no official statistics for Ireland, Liz Dwyer, founder of the Future Beauty Show, a clinical and aesthetic beauty event for consumers, which will run at the RDS on March 1st and 2nd, believes “tweakments” – non-surgical treatments such as injectables, laser and bio-rejuvenations – are as prolific in this country as visits to the hairdresser. In Dwyer’s experience, the majority of both surgical and non-surgical procedures are not vanity-led. “Most of the time, men and women are trying to solve a problem and find a way to deal with something that upsets them. It could be a birthmark, acne, obesity or hair loss caused by anxiety,” she explains. For media professional Claire Craig, it was uneven breasts. She had been deeply unhappy with the irregularities in size and shape of one breast compared with the other for many years, but her insecurities were solidified in 2016 when she went to a well-known department store for a bra fitting. “I was essentially told I was deformed by the sales assistant who suggested that a surgeon could sort me out. I wiped away tears as I walked up the street,” she says. Despite feeling terrified at the prospect of surgery, by 2023 she decided “it’s now or never” so she had a breast augmentation at the Avoca Clinic in Wicklow. The mother-of-one went on to have liposuction on her thighs in November after diet and exercise failed to achieve the results she wanted. She describes the surgeries as life-changing. “I feel really emotional about it. Confidence is everything and feeling good in your own body helps your overall wellbeing,” she says. Craig was quoted €5,000 for liposuction in Ireland but paid half that at the Bangkok Hospital Siriroj in Thailand. Though still in the healing phase, she says she feels great and has no significant pain or problems, just mild fatigue and a little discomfort. She’s back at work now and back in the gym. While she can see some signs of healing and inch loss, it could be the end of February before the full results are visible. Two of Craig’s close friends have also had cosmetic surgery and she says it’s no longer thought of as unusual but is fairly common. Since she has had two procedures herself, I ask about the proverbial slippery slope. “I’m in a good place right now and I realise I can’t continue to do this. I’ve always been very passionate about nutrition and working out so I don’t think that’s a risk for me. Admittedly, when you see the results of surgery you think, ‘God, this is really good,’ but I would weigh that against the recovery time, antibiotics and medication.” Craig was fortunate to have the support of her 20-year-old daughter in Thailand and a childhood friend from Longford who travelled to Phuket from her home in Australia to have a breast augmentation at the same time. Dwyer says that for many people who choose to have surgery abroad, assuming that the surgery has gone as planned, the hardest part is not the surgery itself but the lack of emotional support afterwards. Thirty-six-year-old Lynn Mac travelled alone to Kaunas in Lithuania for a tummy tuck and arm lift in September last year. “I’ve had a lifelong battle with obesity,” she explains. “I’ve lost weight and put it back on over the years and when I finally went on a proper health kick and lost loads of weight, I was left with loose skin and stretch marks.” [ ‘They’ve got these alien features’: The rise of unregulated cosmetic procedures in IrelandOpens in new window ] A psychic medium by profession, Mac admits that although it goes against all common sense, her choice of clinic was based on intuition. “I came across BaltiClinic on Instagram and watched their work for a while, then I met with a surgeon and other staff in Dublin who’d travelled over from Lithuania to chat with prospective clients. They were lovely and I felt no pressure to book.” Mac was in theatre for 3½ hours and the most challenging aspect, she reveals, was being unable to stand up straight for a week afterwards. “I was groggy and my body felt tight when I came out of surgery. I hadn’t realised I would only very gradually be able to straighten up.” She did worry about how she would manage alone when she left the hospital, but her fears didn’t play out. “The hospital staff made sure I was looked after. They took care of all my journeys to and from the hotel, hospital and airport and I had constant contact with the surgeon’s assistant, who was incredible. My family was checking in the whole time too,” she says. The Leixlip native is so happy with the results that she has scheduled a thigh lift and adjustments to her back for later this year at the same clinic. “People argue you should stay in Ireland for cosmetic surgery, but what has Ireland got to offer? We’re not leaders in cosmetic surgery and then there’s the cost.” Mac paid €7,000 for an extended tummy tuck, lipo 360 and an arm lift. She says the same work could cost anything between €15,000 and €20,000 in Ireland. Dwyer agrees the difference in cost at home and abroad is considerable. Brazil is a case in point. “Filler will cost you about €50 there whereas it can cost five times that in Ireland. Every Brazilian I know travels home to stock up on tweakments,” she says. You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox Ms Siún Murphy, consultant plastic surgeon at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic, warns that patients need to be aware of the vast difference between clinics at home and abroad. “Some are regulated and adhere to modern surgical standards,” she explains, “but sadly many do not. Travelling abroad for surgery is not without its risks and issues, especially with regard to post-operative care. Many patients fly back after long anaesthetics and multiple procedures; all of that travel so soon after a general anaesthetic can compromise their recovery and risk clots. While having these procedures costs more at home, the post-operative care, which is almost more important than the procedures themselves, is all part of the operative package here.” Despite the financial incentive to go abroad, Monica Ivani chose to have her eye lift with Dr Murphy at Dublin’s Blackrock Clinic. Originally from Hungary, the 44-year-old explains that she had a heavily hooded eyelid since childhood. “I wouldn’t say it affected my confidence, but I’m a businesswoman; it’s part of my job to look the best I can.” Ivani, who owns MyBrows Permanent Makeup Academy in Stillorgan in Dublin, says she looks younger and fresher since the eye lift and has no visible scar. [ Cosmetic surgery tourism: Demi Moore’s new film shows what influencer videos won’t – the scalp infections and weeping woundsOpens in new window ] “The surgery took 20 minutes under local anaesthetic and I didn’t feel anything during or after. I had no side effects or bruising and just a little bit of swelling for a few days. You can see it all on my social media account.” Several of Ivani’s friends have had eye lifts in France and England. “Surgery abroad is so much cheaper, but I chose the Blackrock Clinic in case I had complications afterwards.” Ivani believes at least half of her clientele have had work done. “Europeans are a lot more open about the subject,” she says. “Irish people are very private, although that’s beginning to change. I’m very open about it. I think the eye lift was brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone.” Dwyer believes more transparency can only be a good thing. On her podcast Fess Up, she invites individuals in the public eye to get real about everything from mummy makeovers to colonics. “More honesty means greater awareness and this will raise industry standards for everyone.” While Ivani describes herself as “very pro-plastic surgery”, she doesn’t believe in going overboard. “I don’t want to change, I want to look natural and like the best version of myself. After 40, skin becomes looser and signs of ageing become more obvious. I would like to age gracefully – I don’t mind wrinkles, it’s all part of life – but you can’t let yourself go completely.” At 24, Patrick Blue has no need to worry about the ravages of time, yet the creative make-up artist and social media manager has had several aesthetic treatments in cosmetic clinics in Dublin, from lip filler and mesotherapy (injections under the skin to promote loss of fat) to Botox and dermaplaning (scraping off dead skin cells with a scalpel). In November 2022, he had a septoplasty and rhinoplasty in Istanbul at a cost of €2,400; this included surgery, accommodation and transfers. His first tweakment was lip filler at age 18. He thought it would be a fun thing to do with his mum so he treated them both. It was her first time too – and, as it turned out, her last. Blue says she enjoyed the experience but decided needles weren’t for her. The Enniscorthy native reveals all of his peers are investing in their skin now, “especially when it comes to basic stuff like Botox, fillers and boosters”. Although by law in Ireland Botox can only be administered by a doctor, dentist or registered nurse, in recent years, with the increased demand for such procedures, a wider number of health practitioners are diversifying to cater to the growing market. He adds: “Treatments aren’t that expensive any more. One ml of lip filler is €250 and Botox can range from €240 per unit.” The septoplasty was to repair a breathing problem and a blockage in one of his nostrils, but he decided that while he was having it done, he’d have a “minor fix” on his nose. “I was happy with my nose shape, but I thought it could be improved,” he says. Blue spent three years researching clinics before he decided on the Memorial Bahçelievler Hospital. “I had no pain at all after the surgery and the next day I enjoyed a three-hour boat cruise around Istanbul,” he says. Blue has been creating social media content for Dublin aesthetic clinics for the past five years and he says it’s not only common to see mums and daughters attending together but wives accompanying their husbands. “You see every single type of man coming in to get work done, from tradesmen treating the effects of sun damage to grandfathers getting Botox because they want to look good in christening photos. Men are much more conscious of their skin these days.” It’s Halloween night 2024. From beyond the glass at terminal two in Dublin Airport, the city skyline is alight with fireworks – all vision, no sound, the best kind. First stop Dubai; final destination: Phuket, Thailand. Phuket airport is heaving with travellers. Once we get through a long and humid immigration queue, it’s on to the hotel. We stay at Ratana Hotel Rassada, about 20 minutes outside Phuket Old Town. The hotel, which has a 20-metre pool and incredibly friendly staff, costs €30 per night with breakfast included. At Bangkok Hospital Siriroj I meet their wonderful client manager Nokky, who I have been corresponding with over email for several months. On the fourth floor, where the elective surgery consultations take place, I am brought through a series of tests, including X-rays, blood pressure and cardiac checks before being introduced to Dr Jib, who will do my surgery. I have chosen to have Vaser liposuction on my inner thighs. I was quoted €5,500 at home; in Thailand it’s €2,500. The surgery is scheduled for November 5th but pushed back to November 7th when Dr Jib hears I did not stop taking my fish oils as instructed (which can affect blood clotting and bruising). To be safe, we need to wait a few more days until they have left my system. The driver takes me back to the hotel where I feel reassured and impressed by the experience I have just had. Three free days until my surgery so it’s time to explore! Post-surgery, no swimming is allowed as the risk of infection is too high, so it’s time to enjoy Thailand’s beautiful coastal areas. The day of my surgery arrives. I have been fasting from midnight. When my driver collects me at 8am, I take a small overnight bag. While staying overnight is not always necessary, it’s a measure of care given here and reassuring. I meet Dr Jib and see him change from medical maestro to artist as he applies his permanent marker to the areas he will operate on on my body. I am then taken by a nurse to be checked into my private room. The room is bright, white and airy, with two beds. A companion is welcome to stay overnight with you if you request it. It feels like a five-star hotel, with luxury branded toiletries, a stocked fridge and waterfall shower. I feel a little giddy when I step out on the balcony and take in the leafy green garden views. I’m told to begin getting ready and change into a hospital gown – the procedure is scheduled for 11am. [ ‘For many people, plastic surgery is not about vanity at all’Opens in new window ] No nerves till now but they do start to kick in. I feel vulnerable, wearing just a hospital gown, in a foreign country in a strange bed. I am taken in the lift by the medical team to the fifth floor. While the other floors are all quite floral and dreamy, when the fifth floor sealed door is opened, the air is heavier. The faces, while still friendly, have the edge of being a little more serious, which both alarms and reassures me at the same time. I am moved from trolley to operating table. It’s a hive of activity and bright lights, with six or seven people in the room. I feel a bit queasy when I see the surgical instruments being prepared, so I turn my head to look at the black, glossy bulk of the Vaser liposuction machine ready for action. The theatre doors swing open and Dr Jib is scrubbed up and in the room ready for action. He greets me kindly and continues to prep. Next up, the anaesthetist, a man with kind eyes, enters the room. He holds my hand and introduces himself as Peter. We chat and he tells me I’m lovely and friendly and I start to cry, a little overwhelmed with emotion and nerves. He says he is going to put me to sleep, that I’m not to worry about a thing. An injection in my left arm makes me feel tingly. There’s a mask on my face and in less than 90 seconds I am under the sedation spell. It’s nearly 3pm when I wake up back in my hospital room. Dr Jib is at my bedside with a nurse to welcome me back to consciousness with the good news that the operation was a success. “Nearly 700cc from each side,” he says proudly and with the look of man who maybe isn’t used to seeing thighs made of such sustainable stuff. I immediately imagine two cartons of Avonmore pink milk as a reference, and nod in agreement that that’s a fairly impressive amount. Post surgery, I have been dressed in a compression garment, which is essentially a pair of high-waisted, extra-tight leggings which I am to wear day and night for six weeks for best results. My legs are elevated and I am given a device with a button for pain and a button to call a nurse if needed. Despite having zero pain – just minor discomfort – I take advantage of the morphine button and float into a restful, recuperative sleep. I am woken with a menu to choose my meals. I opt for the salmon and mashed potato, which tastes both comforting and nourishing. I sleep well all night and I am nearly a little sad when it’s time to be discharged the next day. It was so lovely to be minded. The nurses help me dress, and I am given antibiotics and painkillers to take back to hotel. I am on my feet and moving slowly and carefully. Client manager Nokky is there to check in on me and make sure I have everything I need. I arrive back to the hotel and sit by the pool with friends to update them on all the news. I’m still a little queasy and suddenly have to lunge to a bin and vomit. I retire to my room after that. While recovering in paradise is lovely, it wouldn’t be possible without air-con. In the days post surgery, I have minor discomfort but no pain. I tire quickly and am swollen (zero results visible yet). I am also on antibiotics so alcohol is out too. The day before my flight home I have my final check-up with Dr Jib. He changes dressings and inspects healing, checks all vitals etc. I am still very bruised and swollen and I am told I must be patient with the results. I feel lighter but am so badly bruised I feel sad – the post-surgery low mood is a real thing. It could be Christmas when swelling will really diminish. My anxiety has been building about the long flight home. Dr Jib writes me a note for the airline and I am to be given an aisle seat to be able to walk freely on flight. The departures area at Phuket airport is so busy it’s bordering on chaotic – this is my lowest moment on my trip. Boarding the flight takes longer than expected and I have to stand for a long period of time in a jostling queue, which I had not anticipated. I had not requested assistance or booked any priority boarding. I would not make this mistake again. I am home for several weeks now and back at work. I became fatigued very quickly for the first 10 days but saw a return to normal energy levels after that. Walking and light household duties are fine but no gym/running for a few more weeks. Still very much in the healing phase but I have started to see some results, which is encouraging. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Authorized participants, aka large institutional investors, would be able to redeem shares of the ETF for the underlying Bitcoin, rather than being forced to sell the Bitcoin via a market maker and deliver cash instead. That's the current status quo, as established when IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs were approved for trading by the SEC in January 2024, when Joe Biden was president and the regulator was run by crypto skeptic Gary Gensler. But things are changing under the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump, including the departure of Gensler and the creation of an SEC crypto task force that appears focused on creating clear regulation for the industry. On Thursday, the SEC rescinded the controversial crypto accounting rule, called SAB 121, which discouraged banks from taking custody of crypto. But this new rule would significantly streamline the process of redemptions, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, with fewer steps and fewer parties needed to complete a redemption. And without a requirement to redeem for cash, there could be less selling of Bitcoin overall when ETFs are hit with redemption requests. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer "What does this mean?" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 In a post reply on X, Seyffart pointed to the SAB 121 repeal as a key part of the equation in the proposed ETF rule change. "The side effects from abolishing SAB 121 are likely only just beginning," he suggested.

Title: Why Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) Is Among the Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Humane Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against other best humane stocks to invest in now. In recent years, the investment landscape has seen a significant shift towards socially responsible investing strategies. Among these, humane investing has gained considerable traction. Humane investing is a comprehensive socially responsible investing strategy that encompasses several key aspects. Firstly, it involves the reduction of animal products. This can range from food and fashion to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, focusing on companies that minimize or eliminate the use of animal products. Secondly, it ensures that businesses respect human rights and address any adverse outcomes. This includes fair labor practices, anti-discrimination policies, and ethical supply chain management. Thirdly, it promotes environmental conservation, such as reducing carbon footprints, sustainable sourcing, and waste reduction. Lastly, it involves shareholder activism, where investors engage with companies to improve welfare practices.

On January 24, Morningstar reported that the landscape of sustainable investing is entering a new era of complexity, characterized by a stark divide between the United States and Europe. This shift was precipitated by a series of significant events, including President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. The decision underscores a growing divergence in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) priorities, with Europe taking a leading role and the US moving in the opposite direction. Europe has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable investing, with a pledge to achieve “climate neutrality” by 2050, or net-zero emissions. The European Union has also implemented ambitious mandatory ESG and sustainability reporting requirements, setting a high bar for corporate transparency and responsibility. This regulatory framework not only supports sustainable investing but also creates a fertile ground for asset managers to develop and market ESG-focused products with higher profit margins and a global reach. Conversely, the US under the Trump administration has taken a different path. Trump’s inaugural speech signaled a pivot toward promoting fossil fuels and scaling back support for renewable energy sources. This shift is reflected in the actions of major financial institutions, such as the world’s six largest banks withdrawing from a major climate coalition, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, pulling out of a similar group. This move is seen as a significant setback by sustainably-minded investors as the financial industry plays a crucial role in financing companies and achieving net-zero emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement. For asset managers, this two-speed world presents both challenges and opportunities. European managers, who operate in a market where sustainability is mainstream, are likely to gain a competitive advantage. They can leverage their expertise in ESG to attract asset owners, such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, who are increasingly allocating to ESG-focused strategies. This could lead to a preference for European managers, especially in impact investing, where they can demonstrate greater commitment and expertise. US-based managers, on the other hand, are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach, aligning their strategies with local market demands and avoiding vocal advocacy for ESG. This “greenhushing” strategy is necessary to navigate the regulatory and political headwinds in the US while maintaining a global presence, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As the demand for ethical and sustainable investment options grows, humane investing provides a compelling pathway to drive positive change while achieving financial growth.

To compile our list of the 8 best humane stocks to invest in now, we used environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ETFs to compile a list of 25 companies. We then looked at their ESG rating from S&P Global and picked 8 companies that have a minimum ESG score of 60. We also used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database as of Q3 2024 to find the number of hedge fund holders for each company. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 78 ESG Score: 63 Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is one of the largest freight rail networks in the United States and operates a vast network spanning 23 western states with over 32,000 miles of track. The company is known for its focus on fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and community engagement. Union Pacific Corporation’s (NYSE:UNP) long-term sustainability goals align with the growing demand for eco-friendly transportation options. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is focusing on expanding mainline and terminal capacities, constructing new sidings, and extending existing ones. These initiatives are especially significant in key growth regions such as the Pacific Northwest, where the company is enhancing its ability to handle soda ash and export grain, and the Southwest, where it is boosting intermodal capabilities. Additionally, the company is investing in advanced technologies such as GPS tracking for containers and rail pulse to improve service reliability, offering customers real-time tracking and enhanced communication. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is also diversifying its service offerings to meet the changing demands of its customers. For example, the company recently introduced a new domestic intermodal service that has reduced transit times between Southern California and the Chicago area by two days. This innovation has attracted new customers and strengthened existing relationships. Overall, UNP ranks 4th on our list of the best humane stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock files for ETF rule change to enable in-kind Bitcoin redemptions

BlackRock's proposal for in-kind redemptions may simplify Bitcoin ETF operations and lower tax implications for investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq has filed an amended rule proposal seeking to introduce in-kind redemptions for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), according to a Jan. 24 regulatory filing. The adjustment would allow the exchange-traded fund to transfer Bitcoin (BTC) directly to investors during redemptions instead of converting holdings into cash. The filing outlines plans to expand the ETF’s creation and redemption processes to include in-kind transfers as an alternative to the existing cash model. This method could enhance efficiency and reduce tax burdens for institutional participants. According to the filing: “The proposed in-kind transfer process will be an alternative to the Trust’s current cash creation and redemption process.” The move represents a strategic shift in operational mechanisms for Bitcoin ETFs. The initial cash-based redemption process required issuers like BlackRock to liquidate Bitcoin holdings and return the cash proceeds to investors, a structure that added complexity and potential tax inefficiencies. This update comes amid heightened anticipation for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which gained regulatory approval over a year ago. The debate over in-kind versus cash redemptions has been a key technical consideration for issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with earlier discussions favoring the cash model for its perceived simplicity and regulatory clarity. The amended filing reflects Nasdaq’s intent to align with market demand for more flexible and investor-friendly ETF operations. If approved, the iShares Bitcoin ETF could set a precedent for other issuers to adopt similar approaches, further advancing the integration of digital assets into traditional financial instruments.

Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs to closely monitor the demand for the ETF and act quickly by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, last January, the agency allowed the launch of the funds with cash redemption instead of bitcoin. "It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn't want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. "Mainly [they] didn't want brokers touching actual Bitcoin." BlackRock's IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Title: Federal Reserve, BlackRock retreat from climate coalitions as economic realities take precedence
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/federal-reserve-blackrock-retreat-from-climate-coalitions-as-economic-realities-take-precedence/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T19:03:00Z

EditorEconomy Natural News, Willow Tohi In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bank’s purview. “Climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,” Powell stated, reflecting the Fed’s reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fed’s exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRock’s departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europe’s energy crisis. The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UK’s climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—far exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology.

Title: 'Too much pessimism' — Fink, Trump and Schwarzman take aim at risk-averse Europe in Davos

Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:41:16Z

The US economy is the toast of Davos, while Europe has been thrown to the wolves at the elite gathering in the Swiss Alps this week. World leaders, business titans, and policy gurus have hailed America's resilient growth, can-do culture, free-flowing capital, and bright prospects if President Trump succeeds in bolstering investment and cutting regulations. In contrast, they called out widespread pessimism, siloed markets, suffocating regulations, and an aversion to taking risks and shouting out successes in Europe. Here are some of the best comments from Davos about Europe: "They're very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved," Trump said about his European friends and acquaintances. "I love Europe, I love the countries of Europe, but the process is a very cumbersome one, and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose." "There's too much pessimism in Europe," Fink said, based on his conversations with Davos attendees. "I've never felt the pessimism being larger and more profound." "Europe is a myth," he said, calling out its fragmented capital and banking markets, and its lack of dynamism and entrepreneurship relative to countries like the US and China. "I don't see Europe moving forward enough; I see Europe still focusing on backward looking too much." Lagarde said corporate bosses are "not very upbeat" about Europe as they're worried about issues including energy prices and excessive red tape. Their concerns should be a "wake-up call that we Europeans, those in policymaking places, have to really take to heart and respond fast to," she said. "So if the European leaders can actually get their act together, respond to this wake up call and existential threat that can be identified, then I think that there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call." Georgieva described the IMF's economic forecast for Europe over the next couple of years as "sort of meh, not great." "United States has a culture of confidence; Europe has a culture of modesty," Georgieva said. She joked the highest praise she ever received from her parents was "not too bad" while in the US, "you just move your legs and you're fantastic, you blink and you're great." "So my advice to my fellow Europeans is more confidence, believe in yourself, and most importantly tell others that you do." Ulbrich, whose company works in real estate and investment management, told Business Insider at Davos that European officials seemed prouder to announce regulations on artificial intelligence than to reveal big investments in the tech. He said that "demonstrates very nicely the difference in culture: The Americans are looking first to the opportunity, and the Europeans tend to look first toward the risk." "A lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU," Schwarzman said, adding that they especially blame bureaucracy for slower growth rates in Europe. Kadri said that since she moved to Europe in 2019, there've been "19,000 pages of regulation published just for the chemical industry," and she's been "hiring more people in the legal and compliance departments than in my innovation department." The executive said that small and midsize businesses can't deal with the "soup of alphabet of reporting" requirements, and the bureaucratic burden is "destroying the fabric of the industry." Kadri called for a major simplification of the rules and removal of red tape to improve transparency and predictability, which she said would improve efficiency and drive investment. Jump to

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: How the Fed’s latest decision could affect crypto markets in 2025

Bitcoin may have kicked off 2025 with a rebound back to $100,000, but since the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s December 2024 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 8, the BTC/USD exchange rate dropped to as low as $91,220.84. Bitcoin has stabilized at around $95,000 since then, but concerns run high whether further news about the future direction of interest rates and monetary policy will result in an additional negative impact to the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have entered the financial mainstream, they have become increasingly sensitive to policy changes from the Federal Reserve. With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the latest news from the Fed, and see what it could mean for the performance of both Bitcoins and altcoins in the months ahead. As revealed in the aforementioned Fed meeting minutes, the central bank once again cut interest rates by 0.25%, or 25 basis points. This was in line with expectations. However, while the latest rate cuts arrived as expected, other takeaways from the meeting minutes caught investors off-guard. Namely, the Fed’s signaling of its plans to reduce the number of 25-basis point rate cuts in 2025. Before the meeting minutes hit the street, the market was still expecting four such cuts throughout the year. The latest remarks from Fed officials regarding quantitative tightening also suggested that the “Fed pivot” this year will not be as rapid of a shift from hawkish to dovish as previously anticipated. Taking this into account, it’s not completely surprising that Bitcoin has once again encountered negative volatility. Nor is it surprising that more volatile altcoins, like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, have all experienced double-digit declines over the past week. As “risk-on” assets, cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, perform better during times of accommodative fiscal policy. Yet while the Fed may be not turning as dovish as previously expected, and is in fact continuing to engage in monetary tightening, the impact of these policy decisions on cryptocurrency prices in 2025 may not be as dire as it seems at first glance. Although the cryptocurrency market reacted negatively to the Fed’s current policy gameplan, said plans could still result in further upside for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For one, the planned implementation of fewer 25 basis-point rates still means a further loosening of monetary policy, helping to justify additional upside for this “risk-on” asset class. Second, with regards to Bitcoin, other positive factors are at play that could drive further upside for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. These include increased institutional and retail investor allocation, as well as the specter of a more favorable crypto regulatory environment from the incoming Trump administration. Binance CEO Richard Teng commented on what we can expect in the crypto industry in 2025, “We expect to see development across all aspects. Crypto regulation saw great growth across the world in 2024 and we expect to see more in 2025. Given the recent U.S. presidential election and expected crypto regulation from its new government, we expect to see other countries follow the lead from the U.S. and enact more legislation across the world.” Teng continues, “In terms of institutional interest, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto business in 2024, and we expect to see more new players next year. More companies are learning about crypto and integrating crypto features like tokenization into their business. This is a trend that has grown for years and we expect to see more development in.” Admittedly, the recently-announced changes to the Fed’s rate cut plans could still negatively impact the performance of altcoins in the short-term. Altcoins are much more sensitive to changes in fiscal policy. Nevertheless, if a bull market continues in Bitcoin, chances are it will spill over into the altcoin space as well. Investors profiting from a continued run up in the price of Bitcoin could cycle their gains into Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and other major and emerging altcoins. Over a longer timeframe, the Fed’s decision to more cautiously lower interest rates and loosen fiscal policy may do little to threaten the long-term bull case for cryptocurrencies. Due to a variety of trends, including the proliferation of exchange-traded cryptocurrency investment products, institutional and retail capital inflows into cryptocurrencies are poised to continue. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, following the latest jobs report, there is growing doubt whether the Fed will further walk back its 2025 rate cut plans. Even if the Fed sticks to its current plan, this asset class is likely to stay highly volatile. Caution and patience remain key. Nevertheless, taking into account not just the Fed news,but the other positive trends at play as well, the opportunity for long-term price appreciation with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still on the table.

Title: Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) on Substack by Jacob Rowe. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ACHV. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV)'s share was trading at $3 as of Jan 23rd. Copyright: nedoba / 123RF Stock Photo Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV) presents a compelling investment opportunity, with its nicotine cessation drug, Cytisinicline, positioned to disrupt the market. The company has reached a significant milestone in its development, completing a six-month safety study involving 300 patients without any safety concerns, paving the way for an NDA submission in April/May. As Cytisinicline holds breakthrough designation, the likelihood of a priority review is high, particularly given its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to Chantix, the previous category leader now available as a generic. This positions Achieve for substantial upside potential, especially as the stock currently trades near 52-week lows despite being de-risked. Cytisinicline’s data from multiple Phase 3 trials underscores its efficacy, with odds ratios significantly outperforming Chantix. For example, while Chantix achieved an odds ratio of 2.88 over a 12-week trial, Cytisinicline demonstrated odds ratios between 5.0 and 6.3 in comparable trials, alongside fewer side effects. Its safety profile closely mirrors typical nicotine withdrawal symptoms, further solidifying its appeal. With an expected price point of $700–$800, Cytisinicline could capture a significant share of the $1 billion-plus nicotine cessation market. Even a conservative 30% market share implies $300 million in annual revenue, supporting a valuation of approximately $1 billion at 3x sales. A 60% share would push revenue to $600 million and valuation to $1.8 billion, representing a potential 5x–10x return for investors based on the current diluted share count. The timeline for additional catalysts is clear. Results from the ongoing one-year safety study, which involves 100 patients continuing from the initial cohort, are expected by mid-year, further de-risking the investment. Achieve’s strategic positioning, bolstered by its new investment banking board members and a cash runway through Q3 2025, increases the probability of a buyout in 2025. Moreover, priority review could lead to a PDUFA date in Q4 2024, potentially driving a sharp valuation rerating as biopharma funds recognize the mismatch between market price and intrinsic value. With its transformative potential and favorable risk/reward profile, Achieve Life Sciences stands as a strong candidate for multi-bagger returns. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 6 hedge fund portfolios held ACHV at the end of the third quarter which was 7 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ACHV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACHV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s Need to Know: Davos newsletter. To get updates on the World Economic Forum delivered straight to your inbox, sign up here. After a week dominated by President Donald Trump’s shadow and tariff tensions, Davos 2025 wrapped up with a subdued final day, giving the world’s elite a chance to catch their breath and focus on the broader picture. One of the final panels brought together the world’s top economic voices for a reality check. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pushed back against European pessimism, saying that “the economy is larger than any one political party.” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pointed to Europe’s “huge potential” in GDP, talent, and savings, urging leaders to “respond to this wake-up call and existential threat.” Both Lagarde and IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva emphasized AI’s crucial role in growth. “Make sure that artificial intelligence is not a privilege of few,” Georgieva urged. Lagarde said that AI’s potential is “huge,” but that it must “improve the state of the world, for all of us.” Georgieva also zeroed in on productivity as the key differentiator between U.S., European, and emerging market growth. Her prescription for lagging regions? “Capital has to have long legs and go where it makes the biggest difference,” she said, with a particular call for Europe to deepen its capital markets. All of these themes echoed through the week at the World Economic Forum: Europe’s challenges and potential, AI’s promise and perils, and the ever-present question of American influence. The gathering’s official theme, “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,” took on new meaning with each passing day. Monday opened with European leaders defending democracy and climate action against Trump’s America First agenda. By midweek, his virtual appearance laid out a second-term vision from tariffs to his $500 billion “Stargate” AI project, while Meta’s moderation retreat and Spain’s call for digital ID requirements highlighted the growing rift over tech governance. NATO chief Mark Rutte surprised many by embracing Trump’s Russia stance, while WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala urged everyone to “chill” about tariffs. Even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund chief agreed on one thing: Trump’s return was awakening Wall Street’s “animal spirits.” Through it all, one message remained clear: Whether it’s AI access, trade policy, or capital markets, the push-and-pull between cooperation and competition will define 2025 — Trump’s version of it, anyway.

Title: This week's meme coin mania sparked a wave of unauthorized tokens looking to cash in on the frenzy
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/trump-crypto-meme-coin-rally-melania-barron-ivanka-sorkin-bitcoin-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T16:41:16Z
Full Content:
Trump's meme coin was the talk of the crypto market this week, and its success sparked a wave of unofficial tokens looking to woo investors with the promise of swift gains. The frenzy began shortly after Donald and Melania Trump launched their own meme tokens, $Trump and $Melania, the weekend before the inauguration. Those coins attracted a rush of retail money — much of it from first-time crypto buyers — as well as some big money "whales." As their prices went parabolic, it didn't take long for imitators to crop up, with issuers minting new tokens bearing the names of high-profile figures. A meme coin named after Ivanka Trump quickly climbed 275%, according to CoinMarketCap data, with the coin spiking the morning of the presidential inauguration. However, unlike the official Trump and Melania tokens, $Ivanka is not affiliated with anyone in the Trump family. Ivanka Trump took to social media on Thursday to warn her followers about the crypto coin, adding that her legal team would be pursuing measures to "stop the continued misuse" of her name. "It has come to my attention that a fake crypto coin called 'Ivanka Trump' or '$IVANKA' is being promoted without my consent or approval," the first daughter wrote on X. "To be clear: I have no involvement with this coin. This fake coin risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money." The coin has plummeted 45% in the last 24 hours. Then there was a coin that invoked the name of Barron Trump, the president's youngest son. The price of $Barron coin soared rapidly amid a cocktail of social media hype and misinformation, garnering a market value of more than $450 million. However, when it became clear that the token had no official connection to anyone in the Trump camp, the price plunged as much as 95%. CNBC anchor and DealBook editor Andrew Ross Sorkin was another target of meme coin madness. "Sorkincoin" hit the market shortly after the journalist's talk with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which they joked that someone should create a coin inspired by Sorkin. Sure enough, a token bearing his name was minted soon after. Sorkincoin topped $170 million in trading volume in 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data shows, and Sorkin only found out about the crypto when a friend texted him about it, he told "Squawk Box" on Friday. "I was going to say, strangely flattering, but completely unauthorized. We don't know who created it. It's just a very strange thing to watch this thing go," he added. The week's meme coin mania caps off a heady few months for the crypto space since President Trump won the election last November. Trump, who was branded the "crypto president" while on the campaign trail, unleashed a burst of optimism for cryptocurrencies in hopes that the new administration would loosen regulation of the space and even get the government involved in bitcoin by establishing a national reserve. A long-awaited executive order on Thursday was light on specifics, however. Notably, while it addressed the potential creation of a national crypto stockpile, it didn't indicate that the government would necessarily be buying digital assets. Instead, it said a group would examine the potential for a reserve "derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." Elsewhere, the order was mainly related to the promotion of technology and clear regulations meant to support the space. Some on Wall Street have voiced skepticism over the exuberance that has gripped crypto recently. David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, noted that the market has entered the "fartcoin" stage of the cycle, wherein meme coins proliferate. "Nothing stops the launch of many more tradable coins," Einhorn wrote in his quarterly letter to investors. "It's anyone's guess as to what will happen next, but it feels like it's going to be wild."

(Tennessee Office of the Attorney General) R.E. Wermus Reeve Wermus is a journalism intern for The Daily Signal. Jonathan Skrmetti is on a winning streak. Tennessee’s attorney general is hoping it continues all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Skrmetti announced Thursday his latest win, a $7.4 billion settlement with members of the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma for fueling the opioid epidemic. Tennessee was among the 15 states that accused the company of creating a crisis across America that led to opioid addictions and overdose deaths. A week earlier, Skrmetti won a consumer protection lawsuit against BlackRock, ensuring that Tennesseans’ retirement funds will no longer be used to support the environmental, social, and governance agenda. “Tennessee beats ESG!” Skrmetti wrote on X. “BlackRock’s stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.” Tennessee beats ESG!BlackRock's stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose. Transparency and accountability guarantee consumers an informed choice.… pic.twitter.com/x49nE5BFFO Those victories might eventually pale in comparison to a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, which will decide if states can protect minors from transgender medical procedures. As the Supreme Court deliberates the groundbreaking case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, the attorney general spoke to Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts on his weekly podcast “The Kevin Roberts Show.” The court is expected to rule on the case at the end of its term in June. Skrmetti and Roberts discussed a wide range of topics, from combating the ESG movement in Tennessee to his recent victory halting the Biden administration’s rewrite of Title IX. He detailed his concerns with the regulatory approach of the Biden administration, saying, “I think the apotheosis of that overreach has been the Title IX rule.” Title IX was enacted in 1972 to prohibit sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. Starting under the Obama administration and continuing during President Joe Biden’s reign, Democrats have attempted to use Title IX to advance their gender ideology agenda. That came to a halt Jan. 9 when a federal court in Kentucky ruled that the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX rule was unconstitutional. The Biden administration would have required educators to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s sex and allowed students to use facilities that do not align with their sex. The case, called Tennessee v. Cardona, marked another major win for Skrmetti and Alliance Defending Freedom. Skrmetti, who sought to protect minors from LGBTQ+ ideology, called Biden’s effort a “totalitarian intrusion into every American school and university.” He explained how making major changes to American law through the current regulatory process bypasses key democratic principles. “You eliminate the need for consensus, you eliminate the transparency, you eliminate the public participation in the process, and ultimately, you alienate Americans from their government,” he warned. The attorney general hopes Tennessee v. Cardona and other regulatory cases brought by attorneys general will “force structural change in the approach of every executive branch.” When asked how America can continue to keep its system of law working, Skrmetti said, “When you look at the size and scope of the executive branch, Congress doesn’t have the muscle to exert real oversight.” He told Roberts that Congress does not have the necessary expertise to author “complicated legislation,” too often deferring instead to executive branch agencies. Watch the full episode of “The Kevin Roberts Show” to hear Skrmetti discuss the fight against government overreach, protecting minors from transgender ideology, and the ongoing U.S. v. Skrmetti case. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Title: Why Is George Soros Bullish On Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire George Soros' Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against George Soros' long-term stock picks. George Soros is one of the most influential figures in finance, philanthropy, and global affairs. As the founder of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, Soros has achieved monumental success as a hedge fund manager while using his wealth to champion democratic values, human rights, and social causes worldwide. Soros was born in Hungary during World War II, and his family survived Nazi occupation by securing false identities and hiding from persecution. In 1947, Soros fled Hungary and moved to England, where he studied at the London School of Economics. After graduating in 1952, Soros worked in various merchant banks before moving to the United States. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Soros began his career in finance in New York City, where he gained experience in arbitrage and securities trading. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management, which later became the Quantum Fund, one of the most successful hedge funds in history. Between 1970 and 2000, the Quantum Fund generated an average annual return of over 30%, making it one of the best-performing funds in history. In 1992, Soros became famous as the man who broke the Bank of England. He bet against the British pound, anticipating that it would be devalued due to economic pressures. His position netted him a profit of $1 billion in a single day, cementing his status as a legendary investor. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, his net worth is estimated at $7.2 billion. The 13F portfolio of his hedge fund is worth more than $6.9 billion. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Soros Fund Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of a refinery tower surrounded by the sprawling landscape of pipelines in an oil & gas midstream facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Soros Fund Management's Stake: $5.5 million Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a midstream natural gas and crude oil pipeline company with headquarters in Houston, Texas. The following key aspects make this company a standout investment. Firstly, as per the report of the fourth quarter of 2024, the reported net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion, or $0.65 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This portrays that the company is effectively improving its earnings per unit, reflecting operational efficiency and potentially leading to increased returns for shareholders. Also, an 8% increase was observed compared to $1.3 billion, or $0.60 per unit on a fully diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2023, demonstrating positive financial health and the company’s ability to attract more capital. Secondly, the company declared a quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common unit, maintaining its commitment to returning value to unitholders.

Title: What does OpenAI get from Stargate? A $500 billion chance to build a whole new moat.

Time Published: 2025-01-24T12:53:23Z

OpenAI has a new $500 billion project called Stargate. Consider it an extraordinary attempt by the ChatGPT maker to build itself a whole new moat in the face of growing competition from rivals at home and a buzzy startup in China. This week, OpenAI revealed plans to shift focus and spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure over the next four years. Stargate will focus on hardware powering advanced AI software, such as data centers and energy supply — all with Donald Trump's blessing. It is a colossal amount of money, but OpenAI has two critical reasons for spearheading the initiative alongside key partners SoftBank, Microsoft, and Oracle. First, reaching what OpenAI boss Sam Altman calls an era of "superintelligence" depends on having access to more computing power. The industry insists that AI models will get smarter when given more of it, making ownership and access a priority. Stargate, then, offers OpenAI a chance to build itself the kind of formidable "moat" that Warren Buffett once said companies need to ensure they maintain a competitive advantage against rivals. A vast infrastructure empire belonging to OpenAI would certainly help give it that. The second reason for betting big on infrastructure through Stargate is even more critical: OpenAI may have no choice but to build itself a new moat in response to a Chinese startup that this week caused a stir in Silicon Valley. When OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT to the world, it was clear that the combination of a powerful AI model and an intuitive, consumer-friendly interface gave it a moat that was the envy of Silicon Valley. How much of a moat ChatGPT offers OpenAI has come under increasing debate. The latest challenge to OpenAI's moat came on Monday as a little-known Chinese startup called DeepSeek stunned America's top AI researchers after revealing a new AI model called R1. In a paper, it said R1 rivals the frontier AI model OpenAI introduced just four months ago, o1. Like o1, it reasons, meaning it thinks carefully before responding. According to DeepSeek, which has obtained an MIT license to open-source its model, R1 achieves "performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks." That an open-source Chinese company has been able to release a free model competitive with the best OpenAI has to offer has not gone unnoticed among AI's most prolific leaders. Jonathan Ross, the CEO and founder of Groq, an Nvidia rival backed by BlackRock and Samsung, responded to a question in Davos this week about DeepSeek's latest release by claiming "open models will win." "We cannot do closed models anymore and be competitive — open always wins," the former Google engineer said while noting that it will be harder to differentiate between models soon. As he put it, "The models are not going to be particularly special for long." Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and AI researcher, told Business Insider that he has been adamant for a year now that "closed source players have almost no obvious moat" and that it is "certainly even more true now" following DeepSeek's release. It's not the first time OpenAI's moat has been challenged. In May 2023, when Google was busy playing catch up to ChatGPT, an internal memo written by an engineer inside the search giant, published by research firm SemiAnalysis, warned that "we have no moat, and neither does OpenAI." Why? Because, in the engineer's view, the gap in capabilities between the models being worked on in Silicon Valley versus the open-source community was "closing astonishingly quickly." We are, of course, almost two years on from the warning issued in that memo, and OpenAI has since then convinced investors that it is of market-leading value, having completed a $6.6 billion funding round at a $157 billion valuation in October. Nathan Benaich, founder and general partner of AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital, offered Business Insider one explanation for why OpenAI has retained favor, noting ChatGPT has things like ease of use and reliability that make it a top pick for customers. "OpenAI, I think, has won the spot of being CocaCola for consumers," he said. "Who is the Pepsi? The gap is large." Avijit Ghosh, an applied policy researcher at Hugging Face, doubled down on the point, telling Business Insider that while DeepSeek's R1 performance "challenges conventional wisdom about technical moats in frontier AI," he thinks the reality is more nuanced. "The real differentiation isn't in raw model performance anymore — it's in how these capabilities are integrated into practical applications and systems, and tech behemoths are still leagues ahead in being able to vertically integrate and commodify their models into products," he said. OpenAI offered a demonstration of this on Thursday following the release of Operator — an AI agent that serves as an assistant capable of booking everything from dinner reservations to travel. This is clearly impressive, but resting competitive advantage on AI agents and an easy-to-use interface may still not be enough in the face of an entire industry making "agentic AI" its focus. The AI industry's pace of innovation is relentless. Stargate offers OpenAI a chance to build a new moat that could well be tougher to replicate than a large language model or AI agent for a few reasons. For one, having more computing power is vital to scaling models to greater levels of intelligence, experts say. Dylan Patel, founder of research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business Insider: "Stargate is extremely important for OpenAI to be competitive because the access to compute is what enables them to keep scaling." Groq's Ross, meanwhile, told a panel in Davos that he sees access to infrastructure being so important in the future that "what countries are going to be tussling over is how much compute they have access to." If OpenAI does manage to get Stargate built, it seems it will do so to serve its own purposes. A report from the Financial Times this week said Stargate will exclusively serve OpenAI — a sign that the project is meant to give the company an edge. OpenAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Business Insider. Clearly, then, the Stargate announcement suggests OpenAI sees a chance to build a new moat. It just can't be expected to come easy. Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman noted that while the project is likely to work as a VC play, where the outcome is expected to be delivered at an unknown date in the future after serious investment, "raising $500 billion is going to be a real challenge." OpenAI remains lossmaking, and its key Stargate partners, like SoftBank and Oracle, the main equity funders alongside the UAE's MGX, have cash on hand that falls far short of the $100 billion initially being deployed. From a sheer capital position, a new moat won't be cheap. Building the data centers and clean energy sources forming this new moat will require nationwide coordination spanning multiple initial technology partners, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI, and Arm. Construction of a data center site in Texas is underway, but the project will need to go much further. Hugging Face's Ghosh also thinks the "'compute is everything' narrative misses the mark," as small teams like Deepseek have shown "remarkable results through clever engineering." Still, OpenAI seems ready to go all in on Stargate to build a new moat. Its future leadership in the industry may well depend on its success. Jump to

Investing.com -- Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has suggested that it might be time to reinvest in Europe, citing an overabundance of pessimism about the region. His comments were made during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting on Friday. The Euro zone has seen a modest return to growth at the start of the new year, according to a survey released on the same day. This growth is attributed to stable services activity in January and a reduction in the long-standing downturn in manufacturing. Fink voiced his views during a panel discussion on the global economic outlook in Davos. He stated that there was "too much pessimism on Europe." His belief is that it might be the right time to start investing again in Europe, although he also acknowledged that there was still progress to be made, particularly in areas such as the capital markets union.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -There is too much pessimism around Europe and it could be time to be investing back in the region, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting on Friday. Euro zone business began the new year with a modest return to growth as stable services activity in January was complemented by an easing of the long-running downturn in manufacturing, a survey released earlier on Friday showed. "There's too much pessimism on Europe," Fink said during a panel debate on the global economic outlook in Davos. "I believe it's probably time to be investing back into Europe," he said, adding there was still progress to be made in areas such as capital markets union. On the same panel, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and ECB President Christine Lagarde agreed Europe needed to better mobilise capital to boost its economy. "We need to keep the talents at home, we need to keep the savings at home," said Lagarde, who characterised the global economic challenges facing Europe as Donald Trump's new presidency begins as representing "an existential threat". "If European leaders can get their act together and respond to this existential threat, there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call," she said. Speaking about the outlook for U.S. inflation, BlackRock's Fink said he was not too worried, adding that the U.S. Treasury yield curve reflected expectations for higher inflation and also fiscal deficits. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, trading at 4.64%, has risen from lows of around 3.60% in September. "I can see a scenario, I am not calling for it, where we see 5.5% on the 10-year (U.S.) yields," Fink said.

Title: DWS CEO Steps in as Private Credit Unit Struggles to Lure Cash

(Bloomberg) -- A few months into his role as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG’s asset management unit, Stefan Hoops presented shareholders his vision for growth with a “private debt muscle” as one key part of the strategy. Almost three years on, that plan is sputtering. Frankfurt-based DWS Group is struggling to attract sizable commitments from investors for a private credit fund targeting €1 billion ($1.05 billion), according to a person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, some senior sales staff have been heading to the exit because the pay is higher at US rivals, several other people said. With his blueprint to tap the hot $1.6 trillion market for private credit failing to take off, Hoops, 44, now plans to dedicate more of his time to give the business a much-needed boost, another person said. One idea being considered is to more strongly leverage parent Deutsche Bank’s client relationships for direct lending, that person added. All the people who spoke with Bloomberg News asked not to be identified because the information they discussed is private. DWS is among newcomers struggling to make a mark in the increasingly crowded private credit space, where even BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, has turned to acquisitions to rapidly scale up in a global market that Moody’s anticipates will grow to $3 trillion by 2028. But for some traditional active fund managers, the allure of high returns and management fees is turning into a mirage in the absence of such deals. Last year, Fidelity International halted its European direct lending activities and trimmed its private markets team. On the other hand, US alternatives giant Ares Management Corp. announced this month that it raised €30 billion for its latest European direct lending fund, the largest of its kind in the region. A representative for DWS declined to comment. Prior to joining DWS as CEO in June 2022, Hoops had little experience in asset management. He was brought in to steady the ship after a period of tumult surrounding allegations that the investment firm overstated its green credentials. Now the faltering private credit business has come as a major setback for him. At Deutsche Bank, Hoops caught the attention of CEO Christian Sewing with his cool head when Germany’s biggest lender was facing the threat of a costly settlement in the US. As head of the corporate clients unit that was central to Sewing’s turnaround plan, Hoops oversaw a rebound in the business that was struggling for a long time with negative interest rates. Hoops also scored some wins at DWS, including settling with US regulators probing allegations of greenwashing. He oversaw a 16% rise in total assets under management to €963 billion at the end of September, driven by inflows into lower-margin passively managed funds. The company’s shares have outperformed European peers in recent years. Now, those credentials will be put to the test as Hoops faces one of the biggest challenges of his career: establishing the firm’s private credit business. The alternatives unit of DWS, which is reporting full-year results on Jan. 30, looks unlikely to achieve its goal of a 10% compounded annual growth until the end of 2025, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The unit had €106 billion in assets under management at the end of September, down from €123 billion in 2022, when Hoops took over. The only bright spot of the alternatives unit in recent years has been its infrastructure business, which has attracted consistent inflows. In a bid to build out the unit, the firm did make some star hires. Paul Kelly joined from Blackstone Inc. in 2022 to run the alternatives unit. It also brought in Man Group Plc’s Dan Robinson as its EMEA alternative credit head. The business is currently launching its first collateralized loan obligation, Rhine CLO I. To be sure, Hoops told analysts in October that he expects the investments in alternatives to pay back over the longer term and promised a “packed agenda” for 2025. But the lack of fundraising has weighed on the business. A weak track record is making it even more difficult to mobilize capital, the people said. Getting clients to invest in DWS’s private credit offerings is also challenging because most customers prefer better established players over the new kid on the block, one person said. As a result, the division has seen some attrition among sales staff. Nestanlin Garcia, who oversaw alternatives client coverage in Germany, Austria and central eastern Europe, left for Blackstone in November. Alexander Hütteroth, who oversaw private debt coverage in the region, joined Brookfield Asset Management, their LinkedIn profiles show. Should organic growth fail to materialize, Hoops might revisit a list of potential acquisition targets of European asset managers with direct lending capabilities. Any deal size would be in the low to mid-single digit billion range, Bloomberg News has reported. DWS has also been among suitors that were studying a bid for German life insurance consolidator Viridium Group. The group of potential bidders also included BlackRock Inc. and Blackstone, Bloomberg News reported in October. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Crypto venture capital (VC) funding is expected to recover this year as regulatory clarity and more crypto-friendly policies emerge during the tenure of President Donald Trump, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The Wall Street bank noted that venture funding for the industry has been subdued in recent years. This may have been due to enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the climate of regulatory uncertainty during the previous administration, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The start of the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which came into force at the end of December, is expected to "further bolster VC engagement," the report said. Still, the level of funding is unlikely to match previous peaks seen in 2021/22, JPMorgan said, as crypto venture capital firms face a number of challenges. Giants of traditional finance (TradFi) such as Blackrock (BLK) and Franklin Templeton are increasing their participation in the crypto market, and this leaves less market share for VC firms in stablecoins, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), the bank said. Nascent crypto projects are avoiding large token sales to VCs and are increasingly turning to community-driven platforms to raise money, the report noted. High interest rates also present a challenge for VC funding, JPMorgan said. The growth of cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) products is "inducing a trend towards passive investing," and this could be diverting capital away from VC firms, the report added.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS)'s all-share buyout offer for Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) on Friday is the latest surprise twist of an increasingly complex banking saga. Long-awaited Italian banking consolidation has taken off in recent months, triggered by the state selling down its stake in MPS in November, paving the way for a third big banking group to compete with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit. The latter, not wanting to be left out of a wave of deal making, late last year made its own unsolicited play for Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest lender. The situation is made more complex by key shareholders in the banks involved owning stakes in other lenders as well as Italian insurer Generali (BIT:GASI). Those shareholders include Delfin, the holding company of late billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, and entrepreneur Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone. The following table sets out the key shareholders in the financial groups involved. Data as of Jan. 23.
