We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. This number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report. The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:SMCI) develops and manufactures high performance server and storage solutions based on modular and open architecture. On November 6, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered the price target on the stock to $15 from $32.50 and kept a Negative rating on the shares. The advisory updated estimates based on the preliminary results and the guide. In an investor note, the advisory noted that despite a lack of a detailed financial statement and inability to file with the SEC, the updated estimates should still help investors with margin trends, the company's earnings direction, and the implied downside risk to consensus. Overall SMCI ranks 9th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT sets record $1.1 billion in daily inflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrocks-ibit-sets-record-1-1-billion-in-daily-inflow/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T23:05:39Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) set a new record for inflows, reaching $1.12 billion, topping its previous record of $872 million. The new record was noted on SoSoValue and comes when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $76,677 across major exchanges on November 7. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin broke a new all-time high of $75,317 as voting results signalled a Donald Trump win for the White House. BlackRock’s IBIT net assets now account for $34.29 billion, significantly pushing it ahead of its competitors. In October, BlackRock set a new record when its total assets reached $30 billion in 293 days. Dary McGovern, COO of Bitcoin native Xapo Bank, said to CoinJournal that Bitcoin’s new record suggests a “broader shift in institutional confidence, with notable market movements such as BlackRock’s record net inflows into its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT),” adding: “The growing institutional interest underscores Bitcoin’s increasing recognition as a trusted asset class, driven by rising global demand and mainstream adoption. As more investors seek exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation becomes ever clearer.” The 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily total net inflow of $1.38 billion, also a new record since listing in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted BlackRock’s new record in a post on X, saying: “Even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any BTC ETF ever.” Told y’all it was prob gonna be big, altho even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any btc etf ever. https://t.co/Q5MPDMrTYv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 Balchunas later added that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have taken in a combined $6.7 billion in the past month and $25.5 billion year to date, and are 93% of the way to passing Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million Bitcoin. HOOVER CITY: Bitcoin ETFs took in a record-smashing $1.4b yesterday (the Trump effect). $IBIT alone was +$1.1b. That's +$6.7b in past mo and $25.5b YTD. All told they feasted on about 18k btc in one day (vs 450 mined) and are now 93% of the way to passing Satoshi's 1.1mil btc. pic.twitter.com/dNLoENlDB3 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 “This confidence suggests that Bitcoin is now seen as a legitimate hedge and growth asset, particularly appealing amid traditional market uncertainties and as regulatory clarity improves,” said James Toledano, COO at Unity, a self-custody crypto wallet, to CoinJournal. “Just look at pension funds in both the UK and US investing in Bitcoin too. Sentiment has changed massively in such a short space of time.” Grayscale’s GBTC, the second-largest by net assets at $16.80 billion, saw a net inflow of $7.31 million. Fidelity’s FBTC reported $190.92 million and Ark and 21Shares saw $17.61 million.

November 08, 2024 17:34 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) TORONTO, Nov. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) today announced that it has called a special meeting of unitholders (the “Meeting”) of the iShares Premium Money Market ETF (the “iShares Fund”), to be held on or about January 22, 2025 to approve a change to the investment objective of the iShares Fund to permit investments in asset-backed commercial paper (the “Proposal”). BlackRock Canada is holding the Meeting solely as a virtual (online) meeting by way of live audio webcast. The proposed change to the iShares Fund investment objective is as follows: Following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate in June 2024, the bankers’ acceptance (“BA”) based lending model has largely been discontinued in Canada. The discontinuation of BAs has materially reduced the iShares Fund’s access to credit exposure, which is an important source of yield. BlackRock Canada believes that Canadian dollar denominated asset-backed commercial paper is an appropriate investment opportunity for the iShares Fund in order to continue accessing investment-grade, short-term Canadian dollar credit instruments. Credit exposure is an important tool for maximizing income while maintaining liquidity. The asset-backed commercial paper market in Canada is limited to bank-sponsored issuers and has undergone significant reform since the 2007/2008 financial crisis, resulting in enhanced investor protections. The market has continued to grow in response to the discontinuation of BAs and bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper is one of the primary instruments used by Canadian money market funds to obtain credit exposure. In accordance with applicable securities laws, a joint management information circular relating to the Proposal (the “Circular”) will be made available to unitholders in advance of the Meeting. Notice of the Meeting and information outlining the procedures for accessing the Circular online (or requesting a copy thereof) will be mailed on or about December 20, 2024. Unitholders of record of the iShares Fund at the close of business on December 5, 2024, will be entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting. The Circular will also be made available on www.sedarplus.ca and www.blackrock.com/ca and will include additional details regarding the Proposal. BlackRock Canada believes that the proposed investment objective change is in the best interests of the iShares Fund. If the change to the investment objective is approved by unitholders of the iShares Fund, BlackRock Canada expects that the Proposal will be effective as of January 31, 2025. Implementation of the Proposal is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of just over $77,000 on Friday, continuing its record-breaking streak following Donald Trump’s reelection as President of the United States. The strong support from the crypto community for Trump’s return to the White House is fueling Bitcoin’s upward momentum, making its rise appear unstoppable as of now. The leading cryptocurrency hit a record high of $77,239 at approximately 3:00 PM on Friday. According to crypto tracking website CoinGecko, the top cryptocurrency has surged 113,011% since 2013. This means a $1000 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1 million. Bitcoin’s price is expected to rise further, showing heightened optimism and enthusiasm among investors due to recent political developments. The momentum shows no signs of slowing — among seasoned traders and newcomers alike. Some even anticipate when the top cryptocurrency will cross the $100,000 level. Following Trump’s reelection, investors are pouring funds into the spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds). On November 7th alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK+0.27%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with over $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time high has lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across various digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, hovered around $2,900, while Cardano reached $0.44—marking an impressive 10% increase in the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Chainlink and Polygon, also surged by over 7% and 13%, respectively. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ethereum price prediction – Will rising leverage drive or weaken ETH’s rally?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-price-prediction-will-rising-leverage-drive-or-weaken-eths-rally/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T20:00:33Z

In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion. Ethereum [ETH] has gained by 20% in just two days, with the price oscillating between $2,400 and $2,950. At press time, ETH traded at $2,922, its highest level in over three months. The recent gains have been accompanied by rising volatility. In fact, the estimated leverage ratio has spiked significantly this week to a seven-day high. At press time, this metric stood at 0.42. This shows that 42% of the open positions on the derivatives market are backed by leverage. A build-up of leverage activity tends to heighten price volatility. Source: CryptoQuant However, the estimated leverage ratio has yet to hit extreme levels, giving Ethereum room to continue with the uptrend. The newly opened positions on the derivatives market appear to be longs. This is seen in the rising funding rates to a three-month high. When funding rates are rising, it shows an influx of long positions. It also indicates that long traders are willing to pay a higher fee to maintain their positions, further suggesting that there is a bullish bias in the market. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, Ethereum’s open interest continues to rise, and at press time, it was at a five-month high of $16.61 billion per Coinglass data. In the last two days, Ethereum’s open interest has increased by more than $3 billion, further showing that speculative interest in ETH is high. The spike in trading activity and open positions in the derivatives market increases the likelihood of high volatility. It could also indicate that ETH could be on the verge of an overheated market. However, technical indicators suggest that an ETH bull run could also be underway. Ethereum is currently testing crucial resistance at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on its one-day chart. If ETH manages to flip this price level at $2,955, it could lead to a sustained uptrend. Flipping this resistance could also pave the way for a 12% rally to the 1.618 Fibonacci level ($3,260). Source: Tradingview The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggests that more gains lie ahead. This metric has flipped positive and has also made a sharp move north, which shows that the uptrend is gaining strength. However, traders should watch out for signs of profit-taking as selling pressure could see the price drop to test support at $2,700. A drop below this support could usher in a downtrend. On 7th November, the total inflows to spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $79.74 million, their highest level since August according to SoSoValue. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) ETF had the highest inflows of $28 million, followed by the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust with $23 million inflows.

It’s been a while. Too long really. But seven seasons on from their last meeting in the Energia All-Ireland, the neighbouring Dublin 6 parishes of St Mary’s and Terenure renew acquaintances at Templeville Road again on Saturday afternoon. The last time they met was in March 2018 at Lakelands Park, when Terenure won 35-3. This long-awaited rematch has already brought 330 to the prematch lunch, with another 2,000-plus expected to walk up. They’ll come from far and wide to be there for a game which is also being streamed on irishrugby+. Of course, the rivalries and even friendships in some cases start at the respective schools, both of whom are showing signs of an overdue revival. St Mary’s won their first Leinster Schools Junior Cup final in 27 years by beating Terenure in the final last March. To add even more importance to this fixture, each has won three of five games to date, with St Mary’s sitting above Terenure in third thanks to accumulating six bonus points to their rivals’ four. Mary’s bring in winger Mark Fogarty and flanker Ethan Baxter to a rejigged backrow, while Terenure also make two changes; Jules Fenelon on the wing and loosehead Ben Howard. Leaders Clontarf host fifth-placed Young Munster in a repeat of the taut semi-final two years ago while Lansdowne, sitting in seventh, are in serious need of a win at home to second-placed Ballynahinch. The champions Cork Con, above Lansdowne on points difference after also losing three from five, make the trek to a City of Armagh side buoyed by their win in Terenure a fortnight ago. The bottom two, Garryowen and UCD, meet in Dooradoyle. The top two in 1B, Old Belvedere and Nenagh Ormond, are at home to Highfield and Queen’s, while in 2A the unbeaten pacesetters Galwegians and Cashel are away to Barnhall and at home to Navan ahead of their summit meeting next week in Galway. Men’s Division 1A (all 2.30pm): City of Armagh v Cork Constitution, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Young Munster, Castle Avenue; Garryowen v UCD, Dooradoyle; Lansdowne v Ballynahinch, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch; St Mary’s College v Terenure College, Templeville Road. Division 1B (all 2.30pm): Blackrock College v Shannon, Stradbrook; Dublin University v Naas, College Park; Nenagh Ormond v Queens, New Ormond Park; Old Belvedere v Highfield, Ollie Campbell Park; UCC v Old Wesley, The Mardyke. Division 2A (all 2.30pm): Banbridge v Greystones, Rifle Park; Buccaneers v Ballymena, Dubarry Park; Cashel v Navan, Spafield; Instonians v Old Crescent, Shawsbridge; MU Barnhall v Corinthians, Parsonstown. Division 2B (all 2.30pm): Clogher Valley v Malahide, The Cran; Galwegians v UL Bohemian, Crowley Park; Rainey v Sligo, Hatrick Park; Skerries v Malone, Holmpatrick; Wanderers v Dungannon, Merrion Road. Division 2C (all 2.30pm): Ballyclare v Clonmel, The Cloughan; Belfast Harlequins v Dolphin, Deramore Park; Enniscorthy v Omagh Academicals, Alcast Park; Midleton v Bruff, Towns Park; Monkstown v Tullamore, Sydney Parade.

To put it more precisely: The Wall Street giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has now surpassed its iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets—a remarkable feat given the fact that the former product has only existed since January. The iShares Gold ETF has been offered since 2005; BlackRock acquired the business and brand from Barclays in 2009. As of market close on Thursday, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now accumulated an astonishing $33.17 billion in value, according to data self-reported by the firm. BlackRock’s gold ETF now trails that figure slightly, with $32.96 billion in net assets. Bitcoin and gold are often seen as comparable stores of value, with BTC long referred to as "digital gold" by many cryptocurrency advocates. BlackRock’s Bitcoin strength was unquestionably bolstered by Donald Trump’s re-election on Tuesday, a seismic event that has sent markets surging. The day after Trump retook the White House, the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF saw its highest-ever daily trading volume at $4.1 billion. That activity outpaced even daily volume on blue chip stocks like Netflix, Visa, and Berkshire Hathaway during the same period, according to Bloomberg Senior Analyst Eric Balchunas—a signal of enthusiasm among investors that Trump will indeed make good on his myriad promises to end the U.S. government’s crypto crackdown and champion the novel industry. On Thursday, BlackRock saw its largest ever net inflow for the iShares spot Bitcoin ETF with $1.12 billion. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust U.S. data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt at the time. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Of the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs currently on offer on Wall Street, BlackRock’s is handily the largest. The next closest in size, Grayscale’s, currently holds $16.79 billion worth of Bitcoin—roughly half as much as BlackRock.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Historic Surge – Institutions Go Bullish On BTC With $1.38 Billion Record Inflows
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etfs-see-historic-surge-institutions-go-bullish-on-btc-with-1-38-billion-record-inflows/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T15:30:33Z
Full Content:
Yesterday, Bitcoin had one of its most bullish days in history, skyrocketing past its all-time high to reach $76,990. This new milestone has ignited widespread excitement and confidence among investors, who now see the potential for further gains. Key data from Carl Runefelt reveals that Bitcoin ETFs experienced a historic surge, with $1.38 billion in net daily inflows. This record-breaking figure highlights institutional demand for Bitcoin, as major players like BlackRock are buying BTC in anticipation of long-term growth. The influx into Bitcoin ETFs underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption, with increasing interest from financial giants as they recognize Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and hedge against economic uncertainty. Runefelt’s analysis suggests that this level of demand is unprecedented, marking a turning point that could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The recent surge is not just a technical breakout but also a fundamental shift driven by institutional confidence, setting Bitcoin up for potential further highs as large-scale investors continue to enter the market. Bitcoin has surged into uncharted territory, breaking its previous all-time highs once again to reach a new peak that has captivated the crypto community. This historic rally comes on the heels of the U.S. election, which saw Donald Trump emerge victorious. Market sentiment suggests that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could have played a role in driving renewed confidence among U.S. investors, who are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge amid changing economic policies. Adding to this momentum, traditional investors increasingly pour into Bitcoin through ETFs, marking a significant shift in institutional interest. According to key data from SoSo Value, shared by prominent analyst Carl Runefelt on X, Bitcoin ETFs experienced record-breaking daily inflows yesterday, totaling an astounding $1.38 billion. This historic inflow underscores the growing appetite from institutional players who are viewing Bitcoin as a critical asset for their portfolios. The recent bullish shift among institutions follows a prolonged 7-month accumulation phase that had cast shadows of doubt over Bitcoin’s potential to break new highs this year. Many investors remained cautious, with market volatility and uncertainty testing their confidence. With institutional backing at record levels, Bitcoin’s recent rally could signify the beginning of an extended bullish phase. As big players like BlackRock buy-in through ETFs, the market sees this as a signal of renewed strength. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next moves, with analysts suggesting the recent price action may only be the beginning of a larger bull run for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is trading at $76,000 after reaching new all-time highs. BTC is entering a strong consolidation phase above the previous record level of $73,800. This price zone is crucial for bulls, as holding above it could provide stability for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. Analysts are closely watching this level; if BTC can respect it, the bullish momentum may persist, encouraging further gains. However, the recent euphoria could lead to a consolidation phase just below $77,000—a level some experts identify as a short-term local top. This resistance could take time to overcome as the market digests recent gains and awaits fresh catalysts for another breakout. Despite potential consolidation, demand remains robust, and on-chain data reflects strong buying pressure that could continue driving the price upward.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF surpassed YTD flows of 3,000 US ETFs in a single day, becomes top 3 ETF

IBIT now third highest fund flow of all US ETFs in 2024 with $26 billion inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has secured the third-highest year-to-date inflows among US ETFs in 2024, attracting $26.174 billion. With a year-to-date return of 48.52% and assets under management reaching $30.1 billion, IBIT has outperformed many traditional ETFs in both inflows and performance. Further, IBIT’s YTD return is almost double the next highest from any of the other top 10 ETFs by fund flow. However, IBIT’s total AUM is more than ten times smaller than the other top four funds. Top US ETFs Fund Flows (Source: Trading View) Yesterday, Nov. 7, in a single day, IBIT experienced an inflow of $1.1 billion, surpassing the annual flows of all but the top 150 ETFs in the United States. This significant influx exceeds the total year-to-date flows of the majority of the approximately 3,300 ETFs available in the US market. US ETF YTD inflows matching IBIT daily inflow (Source: Trading View) The substantial inflows into IBIT emphasize the outsized investor interest in Bitcoin-based financial products. The ETF’s performance reflects a broader trend of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets within mainstream investment portfolios. Other top ETFs by inflows include Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) with $88.168 billion and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $57.539 billion in year-to-date flows. These funds have year-to-date returns of 25.69%, highlighting the strong performance of equity markets alongside the remarkable gains in digital assets. IBIT’s ascent in the ETF rankings indicates a shift in investor sentiment, signaling potential long-term implications for the asset management industry. The ETF’s success may encourage more firms to launch Bitcoin-focused products, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial markets.

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on By BL Bengaluru Bureau Comments READ LATER Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. At the upper price band, Swiggy’s valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently holds a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy IPO GMP is indicating a muted listing gain as the shares of the company are commanding a GMP in the price range of ₹1-2, according to IPO Watch and Investor gain which track the grey market activities. “Swiggy’s growth relies heavily on its ability to expand offerings while retaining and attracting users in a cost-effective way. However, the company faces intense competition from Zomato, which enjoys a broad customer base and strong brand loyalty, particularly in the food delivery sector. This competitive landscape puts pressure on Swiggy’s market share, challenging its ability to maintain and grow its customer base. If Swiggy is unable to retain existing customers or attract new users affordably, it risks negative impacts on its business performance, financial stability, and operational results. Effectively managing these challenges is critical for Swiggy’s sustained growth in the highly competitive food delivery industry,” said Samco Securities “The company is an emerging e-commerce and food delivery technology service provider. It has shown steady growth in revenue over the reported periods but has consistently reported losses. Based on its financial performance, the IPO has a negative P/E ratio and is considered aggressively priced according to other metrics. The management is confident in turning operations profitable within the next few years by implementing their strategy and utilizing the IPO funds to scale up their offerings. Well-informed investors with cash surplus and a higher risk tolerance may consider investing moderate funds for the long term,” according to Bajaj Broking Research. Swiggy has a 34 per cent market share in food delivery compared to Zomato’s 58 per cent, while in quick commerce Swiggy’s Instamart has 20-25 per cent share, and Zomato’s Blinkit has an estimated 40-45 per cent share, according to brokerage estimates. The company is betting big on enhancing quick commerce segment as it plans to allocate nearly ₹1,179 crore to its Instamart business. The company will invest ₹755.4 crore in expanding its dark store network, while lease and licence payments for dark stores would amount to ₹423.3 crore. At the end of the June quarter, Swiggy Instamart had 557 dark stores. The fresh investment will take this number to 741. Swiggy reported an operating revenue of ₹3,222 crore in the June quarter, with its net loss up at ₹611 crore from ₹564 crore a year ago. During the same period, Instamart clocked a gross order value (GOV) of ₹2,724 crore and revenue of ₹403 crore. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: $1 Billion in 24 Hours: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Breaks Records

U.Today - In an extraordinary demonstration of demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. funds saw a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion as Bitcoin itself hit new all-time highs. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s IBIT fund dominated the inflows, attracting a record $1.12 billion of the total, reflecting the hype of recent events and a growing appetite for regulated BTC exposure among traditional investors. Most definitely, more and more people are weighing in on Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which shows that investors are beginning to prefer safe, regulated Bitcoin-based financial products over direct exposure. This increased interest is a sign that the retail side of the market is moving toward digital assets, especially as institutions like BlackRock offer access to the cryptocurrency through structured and compliant investment vehicles. Meanwhile, this ETF-driven activity parallels Bitcoin's upward momentum, with the cryptocurrency hitting all-time highs for three consecutive days. Ethereum-based ETFs have also caught the attention of investors, recording the third-highest single-day inflow in history, bringing in $79 million during the last trading session. This development suggests that interest in crypto-backed financial products may extend beyond Bitcoin, suggesting a more diversified approach by investors looking to tap into a wider range of digital assets or trying to catch up through beta, as Ethereum lags significantly behind BTC in terms of price action.

Title: Trump’s return could herald a ‘crypto golden age’ says CEO of stablecoin firm Paxos

Cryptocurrencies surged after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, as crypto investors hope for a more friendly regulatory regime under a Republican president. Flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin briefly surpassed $75,000; other tokens like Ether and Dogecoin saw significant gains. Trump’s election creates “a real opportunity for a crypto golden age,” said Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, a New York-based blockchain platform, on Friday at the Singapore Fintech Festival. “The Trump campaign had a real crypto theme around it, and there’s a sense all this pent-up demand could be unleashed by the U.S. and turn the U.S. into a leader from kind of a laggard,” he explained. The Republican campaign promoted Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate, accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Trump said at a bitcoin conference in July in Nashville that he would ensure the U.S. never sells off its Bitcoin holdings if he returned to the White House, and that it would be a policy in his administration to keep 100% of the Bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires in future. He also said he would establish a crypto presidential advisory council and create a national “stockpile” of bitcoin. A Reuters report in August, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, claimed the U.S. holds about $11.1 billion in crypto, which includes 203,239 bitcoin tokens. Washington’s stash of cryptocurrencies come from criminal seizures from government agencies like the FBI and IRS. Trump also launched World Liberty Financial, a “decentralised finance” initiative centred around a crypto token called WLFI in September. In October, World Liberty Financial revealed it was slashing its fundraising goal in a regulatory filing. The company now plans to raise up to $30 million from investors, a 90% reduction from its initial target of $300 million. Other speakers on Friday suggested that the U.S. was already moving towards a more crypto-friendly stance. Eric Anziani, president of Crypto.com, said “a clear direction was set” when Bitcoins and Ethereum ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. The approved ETFs included funds from well-known investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco. Global regulators are also starting to treat crypto as a more mainstream asset. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, pointed to new Bitcoin ETFs in markets like Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. Yet “the election [marks] the beginning of a new era,” Anziani said. A new Trump election could give more clarity on cryptocurrency regulations. The size of the U.S. market could then jumpstart the crypto industry, Cascarilla argued. Billionaires with ties to the cryptocurrency industry, including Elon Musk and the Winklevoss twins, had endorsed or donated to Trump’s campaign Crypto firms have blasted Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, for cracking down on U.S.-based cryptocurrency firms. Investors now hope that a new Trump administration will replace Gensler with someone more friendly to the crypto sector. “The SEC for the past few years has been waging a war on [the crypto] industry,” Monica Long, president of Ripple, said on Friday. “It’s really hard to navigate an environment like that.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

By Martin Pengelly in Washington, A new book by the chief architect of Project 2025, a hugely controversial policy plan for a second Trump term, repeatedly employs imagery of fire and burning, including calling for rightwingers to “burn away the rot” of American institutions and organizations deemed opposed to conservative aims. The news comes after a White House address on Thursday, two days after Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, when Joe Biden called on Americans to “bring down the temperature” after months of heated political battle. Mixing classical quotes with cliche (“it is time to fight fire with fire”) and metaphors about forest fires and Smokey Bear , Kevin Roberts, president of the far-right Heritage Foundation, advocates “a long, controlled burn” of targets including the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the New York Times, “every Ivy League college” and even the Boy Scouts of America. Related: ‘This victory is a mandate’: rightwing groups ready with policy proposals for new Trump administration Roberts’s book, Dawn’s Early Light : Taking Back Washington to Save America, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy, but the book has proved controversial already. This summer, news outlets used review copies to report violent imagery in an introduction by the Ohio senator JD Vance , Trump’s vice-presidential pick, and to highlight both Roberts’s own violent language and his work on Project 2025 . Roberts’s original subtitle – Burning Down Washington to Save America – also attracted attention, as did incendiary language in promotional materials. As Trump sought to distance himself from the book and Project 2025, including by lying about not knowing Roberts, publication was postponed until after election day. Now, with Trump victorious, Roberts’s heated rhetoric seems likely to alarm progressives all over again. Beginning with a quote from Virgil’s Aeneid – “My spirit kindles to fire, and rises in wrath to avenge my dying land” – Roberts writes: “In 2020, our country went up in flames. “Some of those conflagrations were intentional arson, such as the ‘mostly peaceful’ protests [for racial justice after the police murder of George Floyd] that caused more than a billion dollars in damage [a controversial claim ] in some of America’s greatest cities: Others were more unintentional, such as the record-setting California wildfires that torched more than 4 million acres of our most beautiful forests. “In fact, all those fires were connected. They spring from a conspiracy against nature – against ordered, civilized societies, against common sense and normal people – orchestrated by a network of political, corporate, and cultural elites who share a set of interests quite apart from those of ordinary Americans. “… Be it Black Lives Matter (BLM) in the cities or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the countryside, the … playbook is the same: destroy the embodied institutions that define the American way of life and replace them with ideological commitments and bureaucratic imperatives. “It is time to fight fire with fire.” Alluding to prominent Project 2025 aims – including political purges of the federal government and legal attacks on groups including women and LGBTQ+ Americans – Roberts continues: “Fire has the potential to destroy … To escape our current darkness, restore America’s civic life and take back our country for good, conservatives can’t merely continue putting out fires; we must be brave enough to go on the offense, strike the match and start a long, controlled burn. “There’s plenty of fuel. Like deadwood in a forest, many of America’s institutions have been completely hollowed out … Decadent and rootless, these institutions serve only as shelter for our corrupt elite. Meanwhile, they block out the light and suck up the nutrients necessary for new American institutions to grow. For America to flourish again, they don’t need to be reformed; they need to be burned. A nice start would include: “Every Ivy League college, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, 80% of ‘Catholic’ higher education, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, the Boy Scouts of America, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, and the National Endowment for Democracy.” Roberts does not elaborate on qualifications for his list. But it does contain one name that may jar with rightwing readers: BlackRock, a major financial firm, has been a key investor in Trump Media & Technology Group, the president-elect’s social media company. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s billionaire co-founder, has been linked to an appointment as treasury secretary under Trump. Turning from Virgil – and the composer Gustav Mahler – to Smokey Bear, Roberts says the US Forest Service mascot might not approve of his aims. But, he insists, “any good conservationist can tell you that fire is an intrinsic part of the cycle of life … without regular controlled burns, a conflagration eventually occurs that wrecks the forest rather than renews it.” Saying his aim is “to inspire the New Conservative Movement to rekindle the fire of the American tradition, and to empower real Americans to take back our country”, Roberts says that despite advocating burning down the FBI, he represents “the Party of Creation” against “the Party of Destruction – those who seek to abolish the existing order in the name of emancipation, freedom, and progress”. Related: The force behind Project 2025: Kevin Roberts has the roadmap for a second Trump term Roberts’s fiery imagery and rhetoric does not end there. Elsewhere, he compares progressive policies to Dutch elm disease, with affected bodies needing to be “promptly burned”; says “the only way to revive” institutions “haggard with age, decay, and bloat, is to burn away the rot”; and even meditates on the nature of fire itself. “Man’s taming of fire is the cornerstone of human culture,” Roberts muses. “That’s the funny thing about fire. It is so fleeting, a flame flickering from moment to moment, yet in its evanescence, it is eternal. Of all the elements, fire is most associated with transformation, renewal, and change. You can’t have a blaze without some kind of sacrificial transformation of fuel into fire. Yet precisely for this reason, fire demands an attention to continuity. Unlike any of the other elements, fire dies … a fire must be continually tended.” Particularly, it seems, if it is set under the Boy Scouts of America.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs set new record with $1.36 billion combined daily inflow. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a historic inflow of $1.12 billion on Nov. 7, surpassing previous combined totals for all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This significant capital movement marks the largest single-day inflow in the history of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other major asset managers also reported notable inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC received $190.9 million, while Bitwise’s BITB increased by $13.4 million. Ark’s ARKB gained $17.6 million on the same day, according to data compiled on Nov. 7. The combined inflow hit $1.37 billion, marking the best day in spot Bitcoin ETF history since they launched in January. These inflows coincide with Bitcoin breaking the all-time high several times to a peak of $76,900, breaking previous records twice since the US presidential election on Nov. 5. The surge in Bitcoin’s price and ETF inflows suggests increased institutional interest following the election results. The ETF’s unprecedented inflow outpaced the previous combined total for all similar funds, signaling a potential shift in institutional investment strategies following Trump’s win.

Title: What Trump’s Election Really Means For Crypto?

Donald Trump pledges to make U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the Planet” at 2024 Bitcoin Conference in ... [+] Nashville. Photo by Johnnie Izquierdo. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the crypto landscape could be on the cusp of a major transformation. Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance, commitment to reforming crypto regulations, and vocal opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies suggest that U.S. crypto leadership may strengthen significantly in the coming years. Throughout his campaign, Trump has openly supported Bitcoin, aiming to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet.” He even proposed integrating Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy by creating a national Bitcoin reserve. This pro-Bitcoin stance aligns with Trump’s view that the U.S. should lead in digital finance. Despite years of political and regulatory challenges, the U.S. remains a powerhouse for crypto-focused businesses, driving significant economic impact. Leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity are pioneering tokenized funds, while VISA and Mastercard offer credit cards linked to crypto wallets, demonstrating mainstream adoption. The U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, with $4.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2024, underscores the industry’s scale. In Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins transacted $8.5 trillion—outpacing Visa’s $3.9 trillion—lead partly by U.S.-based issuers like Circle, Paxos, and PayPal. This leadership highlights the high stakes for regulatory clarity. Some major U.S. companies drive global crypto innovation despite regulatory hurdles, including ... [+] Coinbase, BlackRock, Fidelity, Mastercard, PayPal, Circle and more. Photo by Smith Collection. Under Trump, the regulatory landscape could undergo significant changes. Trump has pledged to dismantle what he views as restrictive regulations, beginning with the dismissal of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, whom he blames for the “regulation by enforcement” approach. Trump could establish more straightforward, growth-oriented policies by appointing a more crypto-friendly SEC leader. Christopher Perkins, President of the New York-based crypto investment firm CoinFund, highlights the momentum, noting, “The elections in the U.S. were wildly positive for the crypto industry. While Trump has indicated he will be a crypto President, it’s important to note that 261 pro-crypto candidates were elected to Congress. This is the first ‘crypto’ Congress.” Perkins emphasizes, “We expect regulatory clarity, but not overly prescriptive regulation,” describing the outlook as “very bullish for the crypto industry—full stop.” U.S. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler at a 2023 House Financial Services Committee hearing on the lawsuits ... [+] against Binance and Coinbase. With Trump’s vow “to fire” Gensler, the focus of crypto regulation may be poised for change. Photo by Jacquelyn Martin. Trump’s opposition to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is clearly rooted in privacy and individual freedom concerns. He supported the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, which prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC without congressional approval—a stance echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump’s anti-CBDC position could also influence global trends significantly as central banks like the European Central Bank move forward with their digital currencies. The ECB’s planned CBDC designed to provide accessible, standardized payments across the eurozone, has thus far received limited political attention in Europe, despite concerns over its potential to crowd out the private sector. However, Jonas Gross, Chairman of the Digital Euro Association, believes Trump’s vocal stance could shift this: “If Trump is outspoken against CBDCs, we may see more discussions within the European Parliament,” he suggests, indicating that Trump’s influence may prompt increased scrutiny of the ECB’s approach. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is developing a CBDC for the eurozone—a form of digital money ... [+] issued by a central bank, an approach Trump has firmly rejected. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds. Europe has led the way in crypto regulation, with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) set to take effect by year’s end. Joachim Schwerin, Principal Economist at the European Commission, notes that Europe’s regulatory path reflects its commitment to “balanced, sustainable growth for crypto,” a stance that has already attracted leading U.S. crypto firms seeking European MiCAR licenses. While Trump’s re-election may create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S., Schwerin believes Europe’s approach will remain steady. However, he acknowledges that global competition is heating up, with nations like the Emirates and Switzerland establishing robust frameworks to attract crypto innovation. Crypto enables global transactions across borders and fosters international competition for human ... [+] capital and resources. Regulatory clarity is essential for crypto to allow innovation to flourish. Despite past regulatory challenges, the U.S. has built a strong crypto sector, with major U.S. players driving growth and innovation. Trump’s election could unlock even greater potential by establishing supportive crypto regulation. With a pro-crypto Congress and supportive regulators, the U.S. could strengthen its lead and emerge as the world’s primary hub for decentralized finance. Trump’s anti-CBDC stance may also shape global discussions, prompting central banks to reconsider centralized models. Together, these shifts could position America as a leader in digital finance, navigating a competitive landscape where Europe has already laid significant regulatory groundwork. Yet, as Rhys Bidder, Deputy Director at the Qatar Centre for Global Banking and Finance, observes, “There have been false dawns for crypto before... the hope must be that the industry builds in a sustainable manner.” With this new U.S. administration, crypto has a unique opportunity to prove itself as a mature and credible sector, dispelling doubts and moving beyond its volatile past.

Title: BlackRock Fund Powers US Bitcoin ETFs to a Record Daily Inflow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- US exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin posted a record daily net inflow of $1.38 billion, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of the digital-asset industry and promise of supportive regulations. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for about 81% of Thursday’s deluge, which came a day after the ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $1.1 billion of net subscriptions for the fund — also known as IBIT — was also unprecedented. The surging investor demand helped to push Bitcoin to another all-time high, with the original cryptocurrency rising as much as 1.7% to $77,272 on Friday. It has set fresh record highs every day since Tuesday. The demand for the world’s biggest Bitcoin fund is another sign of how Trump’s pledge to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry is reshaping the crypto market. Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of crypto exchange BTC Markets Pty, said there is a “significant risk of a feedback loop, where rising ETF inflows push Bitcoin prices higher, attracting more capital.” Much depends now on Trump following through on campaign vows, such as creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets. Some technical indicators suggest a two-month rally driven by optimism about Trump’s reelection is now due for a pause. Bitcoin’s roughly 80% advance so far in 2024, partly fueled by Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, exceeds the returns from traditional investments such as global stocks and gold.

IBIT pulled in a total of $1.12 billion on Thursday, beating out its prior October 30 record of $872 million, data from SoSoValue shows. The fund, which has emerged as a dominant force among its 10 other rivals, has a net asset value of $34.2 billion, bolstered by Bitcoin’s heightened value. “We're in a goldilocks scenario right now of monetary easing, political certainty, and robust US data,” Pav Hundal, lead market analyst at crypto exchange Swyftx, told Decrypt. “Capital is everywhere, and right now, it’s flooding into the ETFs at an extraordinary velocity.” Investor interest in the world's largest crypto is at an all-time high, which has driven record-setting heights for the asset, above $76,870, amid surging activity among altcoins and meme coins. “The ETFs are accumulating Bitcoin faster than it can be created by a factor of two to one,” Hundal added. “Sooner or later, this will tip across into a broad-based crypto rally. Probably sooner.” It comes as IBIT posted a record $4 billion in trading volume on Wednesday, vastly exceeding its nearest rival, Fidelity, after President-elect Donald Trump secured a second term as the 47th president of the United States. Trump’s Whitehouse win is viewed by many in the industry as a boon for digital assets. He has promised to protect crypto mining interests, establish a Bitcoin reserve, and usher in favorable policy. The ascent of IBIT as a top Bitcoin ETF comes amid shifting sentiment over investments in institutionalized crypto. The fund has maintained steady inflows since inception, while competitor Grayscale's GBTC—the second largest by net assets at $16.8 billion—has faced negative outflows due to its high fees. BlackRock charges a 0.25% fee, waived until January, while GBTC charges significantly higher at 1.5%. Fidelity’s FBTC, meanwhile, also charges 0.25%, though its waiver ended in July.

Title: Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: ‘We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman’

Time Published: 2024-11-08T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s a blustery Dublin day and I’m cycling northside, thinking of Kathleen Watkins. I’m thinking about her elegance and sense of fun and the conversation that flowed from her like music. She died on Thursday having turned 90 last month. She was let out of the hospital especially for that celebration which, I have it on good authority, included afternoon tea and champagne. Our paths had crossed over the years through her late husband, the legendary broadcaster Gay Byrne, and at children’s concerts around town. Her beloved grandchildren and my daughters attended the same music school. I used to look forward to watching her in the audience, wearing a brightly coloured scarf and even brighter lipstick, the proudest, most besotted of grandmothers, lost in the music. But I knew her by reputation long before any of that. Kathleen Watkins, a woman who kept her own surname after marriage back when that was an eyebrow-raising decision, was something of a star past-pupil of my secondary school. She played the harp at Sion Hill in Blackrock, Co Dublin, and later went on to become the first continuity announcer at RTÉ. I’m sad but I’m smiling as I cycle home having just heard the news that she’s gone. There was always fun to be had with Kathleen. Things were “marvellous”, people were “darling”, food was “just divine” and memorable happenings were “the greatest times of my life”. She was one of the most enthusiastic people I’ve ever met. Arranging a lunch a couple of years ago, she texted a string of red wine emojis in anticipation. A mutual friend was celebrating her 70th birthday. “Oh, to be so young,” she texted. She was about to turn 88 herself by that stage. At lunch she was full of stories and plans and endless, fascinating conversation that covered art and music and theatre and family. There were stories of holidays in Donegal where she and Gay palled around with Brian and Anne Friel. My daughters arrived towards the end of the lunch and under pressure from their pushy mother one of them reluctantly recited a poem she’d written. (Well, you try reading your teenage rhymes to a table of adults that included poetry curator Kathleen Watkins and author Marie Heaney, wife of Nobel laureate Seamus.) One of the many great things about Kathleen was that she knew she’d had a wonderful life and she appreciated it deeply. As wife of the host of The Late Late Show she was Gay’s plus-one to glittering events and first-nights, many of which were arts-related, which suited both their interests. Neither of them were party people but they loved cultural goings-on of all kinds. It was “a charmed life”, she would say. “God is too good to me”. It was a more challenging life after losing Gay, who died almost exactly five years ago. They would have been 60 years married last June. She was full of the memories of their partnership. She loved “his sense of humour, the unexpected off-the-cuff quip, he was so smart”. She told me about the way he’d compliment her, noticing a well-tailored new suit she’d bought, saying “well done, Kaysie”. (He called her Kay or Kaysie, never Kathleen and she called him Gabsie. She was Nana Kit to her grandchildren and she answered to nothing else). She told me she missed Gay dreadfully. “But then I’m very spoiled,” she said of having her two daughters Suzy and Crona close by. As well as being endlessly interested in the arts, in music and in poetry, Kathleen was also a massive reader and rugby fan; she finished reading Johnny Sexton’s autobiography Obsessed last week. She’d often watch Sky Arts at 6am in the morning, entranced by ballet productions or concerts live from the Sydney Opera House. A mutual friend remembers going to annual lunches in her and Gay’s apartment in Sandymount, where they’d host his old Late Late Show production team. There were several sketches of Kathleen by Seán Keating hung in the hall, he remembers. Keating was a struggling artist when they were made. Kathleen would sit for him in his lodgings, which had a single bar electric heater, and pay for the drawings, a way of supporting the artist financially without making him feel embarrassed. It’s astonishing to think she began a career as a children’s author in her eighties, with the Pigín books. She was also involved in a number of poetry podcasts. I interviewed her four years ago around the publication of her book One For Everyone, a collection of her favourite poems. I admired how she was never “high falutin’” about poetry. “I’m not a bit like that. I feel poetry is for everybody.” She was particularly fond of a poem called Love After Love by Derek Walcott, she said it spoke to everyone. What did it say to her? “Well, sometimes you put yourself on the back burner. So take time, be at peace, be calm, look and see who you are. Who you were. Things are good aren’t they? They could be worse. Feast on your life, the poem says. That’s important. I was always a glass pretty full person.” There were three poems by the late Derek Mahon in the book, which was dedicated to her late husband with a simple “For Gay”. The final poem in the book, Everything Is Going to be Alright, was the one she believed Byrne would have liked the best and one that gave her comfort as she navigated life without him. “There will be dying, there will be dying, but there is no need to get into that ... Everything is going to be all right.” We’d been texting regularly in recent months, trying to make plans to meet up “for a chat and a cuppa” – we didn’t get around to it and I am now very sad and sorry about that. Still, we were in touch as she managed visits and stays in the Blackrock Clinic where she told me she watched the racing in Cheltenham – “it helps to pass the time”. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] We exchanged war stories, she was always putting a positive spin on even the worst events. She had suffered a few ailments and she texted one day: “a hip problem and two mini-strokes. Never knew they happened. Feeling good”. I told her some of my own troubles. “Lotsa love, K,” she wrote in reply, with some encouraging words that lifted my spirits at a dark time. She was a great one for prayers, “not a holy joe” she clarified to me once, but she was a woman who loved a good Mass. She credited her longevity to “genes and the luck of the draw”. Kathleen had so many poems in her head right until the end, her memory sharp, recalling the words she held dear. She once told me that Gay loved her to recite Beannacht by John O’Donohoe. That poem contains these lines: “When the canvas frays/ In the currach of thought/ And a stain of ocean/ Blackens beneath you,/ May there come across the waters,/ A path of yellow moonlight,/ To bring you safely home.” Lotsa love to you, Kathleen. We’ve lost a marvellous Irish woman. Safe home. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Poulet Bonne Femme takeaway review: Delicious and succulent roast chicken with all the trimmings

Husband and wife team Gavin McCarthy and Sara Mitchell launched Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire’s farmers’ market in 2009. Laid off in the 2008 recession, with a newborn son and no interest in emigrating, they gambled Gavin’s redundancy on a rotisserie trailer. At first, they sold roast dinners; the sandwiches came later. With a commitment to high-quality Irish food, Poulet Bonne Femme sources free-range chickens from local farms and makes everything in-store daily. The focus is on family meals – rotisserie chicken, honey roast ham, pork with crackling, and roast Irish beef. Sides are all home-made, from roast potatoes to coleslaw, designed for easy midweek meals and the ultimate Sunday roast. Worth noting is the fact that they are also doing pre-prepared dinners for Christmas, which come with the full works: boned and rolled turkey, honey ham, and every side you’d expect. There are six concessions in Avoca stores around Ireland and there are two stand-alone stores – Blackrock and most recently, Dún Laoghaire, where there is also an area for sit-in. Rotisserie roast chicken, roast potatoes, roast root vegetables, stuffing and gravy. Very pleasant. I rang the Dún Laoghaire shop to check on availability and placed my order on the phone. I picked it up that evening. The rotisserie chicken was absolutely delicious. The skin was crisp and golden with a tasty savoury flavour. The wings were crispy and the leg and breast meat was succulent. The roast potatoes are baby potatoes with skins on, so not quite the crunchy delight you get with conventional roast potatoes. The root vegetables – mainly parsnip and carrots – were very good. The bread stuffing was loose, so needed to be moistened with melted butter, but there was a good taste of herbs running through it. The gravy was a bit muted and was improved by punching up the seasoning and adding a splash of wine and squeeze of lemon juice. Everything except the gravy (plastic container) was packed in paper or those round cardboard cartons we now associate with lockdown meal kits. So crushable and recyclable. €39.05 for dinner for four people: Rotisserie roast chicken, €15.95; roast potatoes, €6.95; roast root vegetables, €6.95; stuffing, €5.25; and gravy, €3.95. Open 9am-6pm in Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock. Sundays are a busy day so call ahead to order. Concessions serve from 10am to 5pm or 6pm. Email catering@poueltbonnefemme.com Yes, this is really good chicken and I love the fact that it’s free-range. Ordering the sides means you have a night off cooking.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $52.3M Inflows as U.S. Election Sparks Crypto Market Gains

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. The U.S. spot Ether ETFs experienced a significant boost in inflows just after the U.S. presidential election. The Total inflows for the nine Ethereum ETFs hit $52.3 million. According to data from Farside Investors, this was the largest inflow the Ether-based ETFs had seen in six weeks. The recent inflow is Ethereum’s best performance since late September. The inflow coincided with a 10% price increase in Ethereum, pushing the price of ETH to an intraday high of $2,872, the highest since early August. While $52.3 million may seem small compared to inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, it was a big win for Ethereum investors. For comparison, Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. saw a whopping $622 million in inflows on the same day. According to the data, the inflows were primarily driven by the Fidelity Ethereum Fund and Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust. Fidelity’s fund attracted the largest share, pulling in $26.9 million. Grayscale followed closely behind with $25.4 million. However, the remaining seven spot Ether ETFs reported zero inflows, leaving a mixed picture for the overall Ether ETF market. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, a leading Ethereum ETF, reported no daily net flows. This stood out as BlackRock is one of the biggest names in the market, and its lack of inflows surprised many. Despite no new funds entering BlackRock’s ETF, investor interest in Ether ETFs remained strong. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has faced significant challenges since its conversion to spot Ether ETF in July. The fund has witnessed more outflows than inflows, with large chunks of capital exiting it daily. Some believe its high fee could be the reason for such occurrence. Since July, Grayscale has seen its assets under management shrink by $3.1 billion. This has contributed to a net outflow of $490 million across all Ethereum ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs maintain dominance over the crypto ETF market, with daily flows significantly exceeding that of Ether ETFs. According to Farside Investor, the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive inflow of $621.9 million. This marked a reversal in the trend, as the ETFs had seen three consecutive days of outflows before the election. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund led the inflows, recording $308.8 million, its largest inflow since June. Several other Bitcoin ETFs also performed well, with Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, and Grayscale all seeing inflows exceeding $100 million each. However, not every Bitcoin ETF had a positive day. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) reported outflows for the second consecutive day. IBIT lost $69.1 million in net outflows, according to preliminary data. Despite this, November 6 was BlackRock’s highest volume day, with $4.1 billion traded. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips. Subscribe now!

Title: RICHARD PORTER: Trump Was A Better President Than Biden And A Better Candidate Than Harris
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2024/11/07/opinion-trump-was-a-better-president-than-biden-and-a-better-candidate-than-harris-richard-porter/
Time Published: 2024-11-08T03:11:49Z
Full Content:
It’s a comeback story for the ages: Despite two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, 34 felony convictions, and coverage from the big three networks that was 85% negative (as opposed to 78% positive for his opponent), former President Donald Trump triumphed over all the hate and the haters to win his second term in the Oval Office. Why? Trump was a better president than President Joe Biden and a better candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris. Ordinary Americans enjoyed measurably more fruitful lives under Trump than Biden. And Trump is noticeably more authentic, relatable, charming, clever, convincing, insightful, intuitive and fun than Harris. Trump won on both policy and personality. Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America — media, academia, and big business, too — not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. Oh, and the movie and rock stars, too. Harrison Ford movingly told us over the weekend that he voted for Harris and Tim Walz. The core of his pitch was that “these two people believe in the rule of law; they believe in science; they believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans. They believe that we are in this together… Look, I’m frustrated about a lot of things in this country, I’m sure you are, too. But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other, while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.” It is a passionate pitch, but it fell flat because most of us didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. For those of us who are frustrated about what the government has been doing, it’s merely a beautifully narrated lie. It was a call to trust the prosecutors and the judges who cynically used the courts as a partisan weapon while braying about their fealty to the “rule of law.” To believe government bureaucrats who silenced those who dared to question the origins and effects of COVID-19 — and were later proven right. To ignore the dishonesty of national security officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake even though they knew it wasn’t. To forget that they ran for office claiming that they wanted to unite the country while working full-time to divide it — solely for the purpose of winning elections. We didn’t go along. So, Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. During his first trip overseas as president, Biden addressed the U.S. troops stationed in England. It wasn’t an auspicious beginning. “When I first was elected vice president with President Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were,” he said. “This is not a joke: you know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming.” Despite the disclaimer, a “joke” was exactly what this sounded like. Or, rather, a spoof of liberal excess. Biden was addressing men and women who had signed up to risk their lives on the battlefield to protect their fellow Americans. And he was giving them Democratic Party talking points. The obvious inference to be drawn is that the new commander in chief was in over his head and that the Pentagon is run by suck-ups or idiots. Both perceptions were reinforced soon thereafter, a few months later, by the United States’ disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. When a military focuses on something other than fighting wars, it is on the road to failure. Similarly, nearly all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with facilitating capital formation and discouraging fraud, not suppressing carbon emissions. FEMA’s core mission is to swiftly respond to and remediate disasters, not to find taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants. The FBI’s core mission is to protect citizens from crime and terrorism, not from conservative Catholics. And it is not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. If the information being conveyed does not reflect observable reality, then the press has failed in its core mission. Think of the memorable scenes of 2020 when cable news reporters would describe “mostly peaceful protests” while fires ravaged buildings behind them. The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated on campus today? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That is why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it is auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there is not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, during the COVID pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similar manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy who drives all those pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Trump and his merry band of bold critics — including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard — are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.

Title: BlackRock in talks to buy minority stake in Millennium, sources say

By Paritosh Bansal and Carolina Mandl (Reuters) -BlackRock is in early-stage talks with Millennium Management about a strategic tie-up that could involve acquiring a minority stake in the hedge fund, two sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said it was not clear whether the talks would result in a deal, with one of them adding that the strategic rationale of a transaction was also unclear. The Financial Times reported earlier on the potential deal. Millennium, founded by Israel Englander, manages roughly $70 billion. The multi-strategy hedge fund is up 10% for the year to the end of October, one of the sources and a separate person familiar with the matter said. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which ended September with about $11.5 trillion in assets, has been on an acquisition spree this year as it looks to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. In October, BlackRock completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, putting it at the heart of investing in infrastructure projects around the world. Later this year, BlackRock is expected to finalize its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin, aiming to strengthen its position in private markets. These strategic moves are anticipated to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and private markets, both key growth areas.

Utilities have historically been seen as defensive assets, so the combination of strong economic growth, technological excitement, and higher bond yields has created an unusual backdrop for their recent outperformance. In 2023, the U.S. power and utilities sector made significant strides in decarbonization, setting new records in solar power deployment and energy storage, and enhancing grid reliability and flexibility. The sector experienced mixed fundamentals, with mild weather leading to a slight decline in electricity sales. Wholesale electricity prices fell alongside lower natural gas costs, yet high capital expenditures for grid modernization and decarbonization, along with rising interest rates, contributed to potential increases in customer bills. In 2024 however, the utility sector seems to have outperformed the broader market, diverging from its typical sensitivity to long-term interest rates. Jefferies analysts, in a report released on September 19, attributed this outperformance to AI-related growth opportunities and the sector’s defensive nature amid a softening economy. With falling rates, rising electricity usage, and expectations for increased data center demand linked to AI, the typically stable utility stocks have seen an unprecedented rally. This trend has driven gains in ETFs and mutual funds centered on utilities, including the $18 billion Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF, which has returned 21.77% year-to-date as of November 5, outperforming many other SPDR sector funds. Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar, noted: “Utilities have rebounded sharply since their October 2023 low as the market began anticipating a shift toward lower interest rates and an increase in US energy demand. AI data centers and manufacturing growth represent the biggest sources of potential energy demand growth for utilities in decades.” Expanding on that, Mckinsey states that the rapid adoption of digitalization and AI has sharply increased the demand for data centers in the United States. To match the current pace of adoption, data center power needs are expected to grow to roughly three times today's capacity by 2030, rising from 3–4% of total U.S. power demand to about 11–12%. Meeting this demand will require a significant increase in electricity production, marking an unprecedented shift in the U.S., where overall power demand has been mostly flat since 2007. Data center load could represent 30–40% of all net new demand through 2030, alongside growing needs from domestic manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrolyzers. From 2024 to 2030, electricity demand from data centers alone is projected to rise by approximately 400 terawatt-hours, with a compound annual growth rate of about 23%. The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.5% rate cut, or 50 basis points, is anticipated to provide a boost to renewable energy developers and project sponsors. According to Mona Dajani, partner and global co-chair of energy, infrastructure, and hydrogen at law firm Baker Botts, the start of a rate-cutting cycle "will jumpstart projects." She noted the following about renewable initiatives: "They're very sensitive to the cost of capital, particularly for capital-intensive technologies like offshore wind, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and solar [plus] storage.” Dajani further noted that the market expects the Fed to reduce rates by a total of 100 basis points by year-end, which “would support the growth of the domestic supply chain for clean energy, easing the financing and construction of new facilities for solar, batteries, EVs, and wind.” Our Methodology To create our list, we reviewed the stock holdings of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF. We then selected the top 10 electric utility stocks according to the number of hedge funds holding positions in each. The list is ranked in ascending order of hedge fund interest, as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An executive in a power plant control booth overseeing the efficient energy production. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46 The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES), based in Texas, operates across 14 countries and has evolved from a consulting firm into a major player in electricity generation and distribution. The company owns and manages power plants and utilities that generate electricity from a diverse mix of sources, including coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. For the third quarter, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) delivered mixed results, beating earnings expectations while missing revenue targets. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, exceeding the analyst consensus of $0.59. However, revenue totaled $3.29 billion, falling short of the forecasted $3.46 billion. The company attributed the revenue miss to lower margins in its Energy Infrastructure segment and severe drought conditions that affected its Renewables business in South America. Despite the shortfall, AES reaffirmed its full-year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.87 to $1.97, in line with the $1.92 consensus, and expects to achieve results in the upper half of the range. On September 19, Mizuho reiterated its positive view on AES, maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $24. This outlook follows AES's announcement of the sale of a 30% stake in its Ohio utility. Valued at approximately 1.8 times the Enterprise Value/Rate Base, the deal is part of AES's broader $3.5 billion asset sale program. With this transaction, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) has divested $2.7 billion of assets since 2023, and the proceeds will be used to reduce debt at the AES Ohio holding company, which currently carries around $800 million in debt, impacting the company’s cash flow. The sale is also expected to provide equity financing for upcoming growth projects at the Ohio utility. Overall AES ranks 5th on our list of the best electric utility stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AES as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Yes, JD Vance Wrote Foreword to Book by Project 2025's Leader

Full Content:
About this rating The claim that U.S. Vice President-elect JD Vance wrote the foreword to a Project 2025-linked book written by Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts first spread online when President-elect Donald Trump chose Vance, a senator from Ohio, to be his Republican vice-presidential running mate in July 2024. At the time, it arose in the context of Trump's repeated denials of his connections to Project 2025 — a Heritage Foundation-led conservative initiative to reshape the American government in its own image: The claim reemerged following Trump's victory in the general election on Nov. 5, 2024, in part because the book's publisher delayed its release to occur directly after the election. The book was set to be released on Nov. 15, 2024, as of this writing. It is true that Vance wrote the foreword to this book. Roberts leads the Heritage Foundation, which describes itself as the primary organization behind Project 2025. The book has been described by publishing industry outlet Publisher's Lunch as "the book associated with the conservative organization's Project 2025 policy agenda." The book's original title was "Dawn's Early Light: Burning Down Washington To Save America," and it was set to be published in September 2024. An early publisher's description described its author as the head of Project 2025: As reported by Vox, "the book was written and announced before Vance was chosen as Trump's running mate. But there's some indication that people involved had some late second thoughts about it." In a statement about the changed publication date, Roberts said: There's a time for writing, reading, and book tours — and a time to put down the books and go fight like hell to take back our country. … That's why I've chosen to move my book's publication and promotion to after the election. The book is now titled "Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America." As described by its publisher, the themes and ideas in the book track closely with Project 2025's "mandate for America," which Snopes previously covered: Dawn's Early Light blazes a promising path for the American people to take back their country. Chapter by chapter, it identifies institutions that conservatives need to build, others that we need to take back, and more still that are too corrupt to save: Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, BlackRock, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy, to name a few. All these need to be dissolved if the American way of life is to be passed down to future generations. In July 2024, The New Republic published portions of the foreword Vance wrote from an advance copy of the book. The language, at least in that version, echoed Roberts' calls for a "second American Revolution": The old conservative movement argued if you just got government out of the way, natural forces would resolve problems. We are no longer in this situation and must take a different approach. As Kevin Roberts writes, "It's fine to take a laissez-faire approach when you are in the safety of the sunshine. But when the twilight descends and you hear the wolves, you've got to circle the wagons and load the muskets." We are now all realizing that it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon. Because Vance indeed wrote the foreword to a book written by the leader of Project 2025, we rate the claim as true.

Title: Trump Won Because … He Was Just Better

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Richard Porter Richard Porter, the Republican National Committeeman from Illinois, was a policy adviser to then-President George H.W. Bush and then-Vice President Dan Quayle. It’s a comeback story for the ages: Despite two impeachments, two assassination attempts, four criminal indictments, 34 felony convictions, and coverage from the big three networks that was 85% negative (as opposed to 78% positive for his opponent), Donald Trump triumphed over all the hate and the haters to win his second term in the Oval Office. Why? Trump was a better president than Joe Biden and a better candidate than Kamala Harris. Ordinary Americans enjoyed measurably more fruitful lives under Trump than Biden. And Trump is noticeably more authentic, relatable, charming, clever, convincing, insightful, intuitive, and fun than Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump won on both policy and personality. Democracy prevailed. The people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America—media, academia, and big business, too—not just opposing him, but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. Oh, and the movie and rock stars, too. Harrison Ford movingly told us over the weekend that he voted for Harris and Tim Walz. The core of his pitch was that “these two people believe in the rule of law; they believe in science; they believe that when you govern, you do so for all Americans. They believe that we are in this together. … Look, I’m frustrated about a lot of things in this country. I’m sure you are, too. But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other, while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world.” It’s a passionate pitch, but it fell flat because most of us didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. For those of us who are frustrated about what the government has been doing, it’s merely a beautifully narrated lie. It was a call to trust the prosecutors and the judges who cynically used the courts as a partisan weapon while braying about their fealty to the “rule of law.” To believe government bureaucrats who silenced those who dared to question the origins and effects of COVID-19—and were later proved right. To ignore the dishonesty of national security officials who claimed Hunter Biden’s laptop was fake even though they knew it wasn’t. To forget that they ran for office claiming that they wanted to unite the country while working full-time to divide it—solely for the purpose of winning elections. We didn’t go along. So, Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story. It’s a vote of “no confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core missions. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. During his first trip overseas as president, Biden addressed the U.S. troops stationed in England. It wasn’t an auspicious beginning. “When I first was elected vice president with President [Barack] Obama, the military sat us down to let us know what the greatest threats facing America were,” he said. “This is not a joke: You know what the Joint Chiefs told us the greatest threat facing America was? Global warming.” Despite the disclaimer, a “joke” was exactly what this sounded like. Or, rather, a spoof of liberal excess. Biden was addressing men and women who’d signed up to risk their lives on the battlefield to protect their fellow Americans. And he was giving them Democratic Party talking points. The obvious interest to be drawn is that the new commander in chief was in over his head and that the Pentagon is run by suck-ups or idiots. Both perceptions were reinforced soon thereafter, a few months later, by the United States’ disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. When a military focuses on something other than fighting wars, it’s on the road to failure. Similarly, nearly all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. The Department of Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. The Securities and Exchange Commission is tasked with facilitating capital formation and discouraging fraud, not suppressing carbon emissions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s core mission is to swiftly respond to and remediate disasters, not to find taxpayer-funded housing for illegal immigrants. The FBI’s core mission is to protect citizens from crime and terrorism, not from conservative Catholics. And it’s not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. If the information being conveyed does not reflect observable reality, then the press has failed in its core mission. Think of the memorable scenes of 2020 when cable news reporters would describe “mostly peaceful protests” while fires ravaged buildings behind them. The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated on campus today? Nor are once-venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target, and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into the C-suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers. Just as government, media, and business institutions have been degraded by being politicized, so, too, have public “experts.” Socrates, perhaps the greatest-ever expert on knowledge, observed that the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing. He refused to use his expertise authoritatively, but instead, he used his expertise to empower others to think through problems. While few voters read Socrates today, almost everyone knows that experts don’t always agree. That’s why when we encounter difficult or expensive problems, we shop for second opinions. Whether it’s auto repair or brain surgery, we know it makes sense to get a second and sometimes a third opinion. Why? Experts have different perspectives and different motivations. Often, there’s not one answer. We may ultimately rely on an expert’s judgment, but not without using their expertise to understand the problem in order to make a better decision ourselves. Public experts tend to be more authoritative and less advisory, which undermines faith in experts generally. For example, Dr. Anthony Fauci and the team of government experts used their “expert” status authoritatively and politically, seeking to rule over others instead of empowering them to decide for themselves. They misled the public on the origin of COVID-19, the efficacy of masks, and the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Equating himself with “the science,” Fauci sought to silence critics, quell inquiry, and disempower people from making fully informed decisions. This lack of Socratic modesty caused millions to lose faith in all public experts who behave in a similarly authoritative manner. So, in a world in which so much is going wrong, electing the guy that drives all those prevaricating pontificators nuts just makes sense. A working majority of the American people were convinced that, despite (or perhaps because of) all the hate they attract, Donald Trump and his merry band of bold critics—including former Democrats Bobby Kennedy, Elon Musk, and Tulsi Gabbard—are the best bet for purging the system in order to make America great again.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) surpassed $23.3 billion in net asset value (NAV) in the third quarter, registering a 20% quarterly growth, according to a Nov. 7 to a 10-Q Form filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) holds 367,805 BTC, worth roughly $21.5 billion, with roughly $1.8 billion in unrealized profit as of Sept. 30. Additionally, since its inception, the IBIT has only sold 0.28% of its Bitcoin stash to cover share redemption, indicating high investor retention. As a result, the fund ended the third quarter with 366,448 BTC under management. The filing highlighted that the NAV growth is mainly related to a 19.8% increase in outstanding shares, rising from 539.1 million to 644 million between quarters. Outstanding shares are owned by investors and are available for trading in the secondary market. IBIT’s liabilities are nearly $4 million, which is related to the ETF’s sponsor fees. Besides that, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has not registered any expenses since January. Notably, BlackRock registered over $1.6 million in realized profit by selling BTC since its inception to cover its expenses related to sponsor fees and redeeming investors’ shares. IBIT registered two daily records on Nov. 6 after hitting $1 billion in daily trading volume within 20 minutes of the trading session. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that IBIT closed the day with $4.1 billion in trading volume, its highest since launch. However, IBIT registered its worst daily outflow on the same day, as $69.1 million left the fund. Balchunas added: “For context that’s more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second best day since launching.” Additionally, the US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $6 billion in volume, a collective record. Nevertheless, considering last week’s massive inflows, the outflows seen this week are not a cause for concern, as highlighted by a recent Glassnode report.

Title: ‘The best of her generation’ – President leads tributes to Kathleen Watkins, broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, who has died aged 90

Kathleen Watkins President Michael D Higgins had led tributes to broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, who has died at the age of 90. Tributes have poured in for Ms Watkins this afternoon from across the world of politics, media and beyond. “It was with great sorrow that Sabina and I learned of the passing of Kathleen Watkins, we were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country. “I hope that all who loved Kathleen will be comforted by these memories, her truly remarkable legacy and her inspiring life. “As President of Ireland, may I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Kathleen Watkins, her daughters Suzy and Crona, her grandchildren and wider family.” Meanwhile, the daughter of Kathleen Watkins and Gay Byrne paid tribute to her “unbelievable” mother who passed away aged 90. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. “Her adoration for her grandchildren was renowned. When I announced to her that I was pregnant with Cian, she said at that time I will forever be known as Nana Kit now and from that day on she wouldn't answer to anything else,” said Suzy. “The children that they are, and the children that they have become, is so much down to her. She taught them their manners, she introduced them to music, she insisted that when we came back from London that they really should do speech and drama. “Her relationship with Cian, Siabh, Saoirse, Kate and Harry was phenomenal and they have benefited from her interest in them and her education of them”, she added. Ms Watkins was described by long term friend Maire-Louise O’Donnell as “possibly one of the most cultured people". Ms O’Donnell said she was always interested in culture, from theatre and film to poetry and language and in young people who were writing, singing and in the media. “She was very much a renaissance woman,” Ms O’Donnell said. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. In later years, Ms Watkins wrote a series of children’s books about a piglet character called Pigín, which won an Irish Book Award. In her final interview, with Sunday Independent journalist Barry Egan last September, Ms Watkins spoke openly about her life in the wake of her husband’s death and revealed that he had made plans for her funeral. She said she had picked the music and the prayers already. Speaking about the music, she said: “I have an idea but I won’t say. I would like Frank McNamara to be in charge of that. He was the musical director of The Late Late. He will know exactly what to do. I will leave instructions.” Taoiseach Simon Harris paid tribute to Ms Watkins in a statement this afternoon. "It is with great sadness that I have learned of the death of broadcaster and author Kathleen Watkins,” Mr Harris said. “Kathleen was a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “She was multi-talented in her own right, and indeed like many households around the country, her books and Pigín have a special place on the bookcase in my home. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss. “May she rest in peace.” Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl led tributes in the Dáil to Ms Watkins in the Dáil, describing her as a “national treasure.” She was “an inspiration to many to people of his generation”, he said.

Title: DoubleVerify Won 70% Of The Former Moat Advertisers It Courted

Moat, ya basic. Well, ya were basic, at least according to DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski. “One thing we did note is that Moat had a pretty basic product,” Zagorski said on Wednesday during the company’s Q3 earnings call in response to an investor asking for more detail on the Oracle opportunity. In September, Oracle shut down all of its advertising products and services, including brand safety and verification provider Moat, leaving Moat’s former advertiser clients ripe for the pitching. Both DV and Integral Ad Science have been in pitchapalooza mode since June, when Oracle first announced, rather abruptly, that it would exit the advertising business. According to Zagorski, DoubleVerify has won 70% of the Moat advertiser RFPs it’s participated in, including P&G, BlackRock, Dish Network, Charter, Dunkin’ parent company Inspire Brands, Kellogg’s and Google. Slow burn But this was “no normal RFP process,” Zagorski said. An RFP usually takes between three and six months, sometimes even longer if a client wants to run tests and do a deep dive into the technology. But here, with so little time between Oracle’s original announcement and when it planned to actually pull the plug, the process was condensed into roughly six weeks. “In many cases, it was very aggressive technical due diligence plus, you know, getting your best price out there,” Zagorski said.

These client wins are flashy and have promise, in other words, but they won’t benefit the bottom line in a big way right away, said CFO Nicola Allais. “The full revenue impact of these opportunities will materialize over a long period,” Allais said, “typically between one to three years of onboarding through our ability to upsell our social and activation solutions.” The upsell (eventually) Attention measurement, social media measurement and social activation are all top priorities for DV to expand beyond verification and brand safety to also include performance solutions. Scibids, the AI startup DV acquired for $125 million last summer, is key to that plan. Today, 15 of DoubleVerify’s top 100 customers use Scibids to optimize programmatic bids across platforms, and DV has been able to upsell Scibids to nearly 50 total customers, Zagorski said. He added that Scibids is on pace to generate $100 million in revenue by 2028. Scibids is DV’s “core investment” on the performance side, he said, and “we’re going to start leaning into and pushing it into other parts of our business.” Presumably, DV will also eventually upsell Scibids to its newly wooed former Moat clients. But DV’s nearer-term goal is to become more than just a like-for-like replacement for Moat. “Moat didn’t do social; Moat didn’t have a very robust, dynamic pre-bid suitability product,” Zagorski said. “These are sophisticated advertisers – they’re big spenders – and I think there’s a big opportunity for us down the road.”

Photo Credit: Facebook/ JP Morgan With Kinexys, we’re building on the momentum of Onyx, the bank said JPMorgan is expanding its alliance with blockchain technology. In a recent development, the US-based bank said it has rebranded its blockchain unit, originally launched as ‘Onyx', to ‘Kinexys' to signify its operational roadmap for Web3 adoption. The rebranding brings along an array of new financial products and services with blockchain at the centre. This development follows JPMorgan's intensified exploration into Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. Expanding on the rebranding, the bank explained that the name ‘Kinexys' is derived from the word ‘kinetic,' meaning ‘caused by motion.' “This is representative of the way we move money, assets and financial information around the world with speed, ease and efficiency. Together with our clients, we aim to move beyond the limitations of legacy technology and realise the promise of a multichain world,” Umar Farooq, co-head of JPMorgan Payments said in a statement. As of November 2024, JPMorgan's market cap is reportedly ₹58.517 trillion (roughly $ 693.5 billion), making it the world's 13th most valuable company by market cap. In its statement, the bank asserted that integrating blockchain into its systems has established a secure infrastructure for clients to transfer cross-border funds seamlessly, even outside of traditional market hours, while also enabling new services related to RWA tokenisation. “Soon, we'll be adding foreign exchange (FX) capabilities to Kinexys Digital Payments (formerly JPM Coin System). We've also announced a proof-of-concept (POC) from Kinexys Digital Assets and Kinexys Labs. This POC demonstrates on-chain privacy, identity and composability—major themes that will play significantly into our continued evolution,” the statement announced. Over the past two years, JPMorgan's Onyx initiative has attracted prominent institutional clients, including Siemens, Ant International, and BlackRock. As per company figures, Onyx managed to exceed $1.5 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,26,55,856 crore) in notional value, processing an average daily transaction volume of over $2 billion. “We're furthering our exploration of privacy, identity and composability in blockchain ecosystems. nhanced privacy measures are crucial for improving access to digital assets, while streamlining identity management is intrinsically linked to the potential for tokenised assets at scale,” JPMorgan noted. Beyond blockchain, the New York City-based bank is also exploring other Web3 technologies. Despite a slowdown in the metaverse sector, the bank announced last December that it was looking forward to test the ‘immersive training applications' of metaverse. In May 2022, the bank predicted that as regulatory oversight of crypto assets grows, they will eventually integrate with traditional finance. That same year, the bank also explored launching a crypto wallet service to address emerging market demands.

She and Gay Byrne married in 1964 and had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. A statement issued today by their daughters confirmed the news. “It is with great sadness we have to announce the death of Kathleen Watkins,” the statement noted. “Kathleen died peacefully earlier today surrounded by her loving family in the wonderful care of the Team at the Blackrock Clinic. “Kathleen’s family are devastated by the loss of their much loved mother and devoted Nanakit to her grandchildren Cian, Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry.” Funeral arrangements will be announced later, the statement added. Advertisement Taoiseach Simon Harris was among the first to pay tribute, describing Kathleen as “a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent”. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage,” Harris said in a statement. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss.

Title: Daughter’s tribute to ‘unbelievable’ Kathleen Watkins, broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, who has died aged 90

Kathleen Watkins President Michael D Higgins had led tributes to broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, who has died at the age of 90. Tributes have poured in for Ms Watkins this afternoon from across the world of politics, media and beyond. “It was with great sorrow that Sabina and I learned of the passing of Kathleen Watkins, we were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country. “I hope that all who loved Kathleen will be comforted by these memories, her truly remarkable legacy and her inspiring life. “As President of Ireland, may I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Kathleen Watkins, her daughters Suzy and Crona, her grandchildren and wider family.” Meanwhile, the daughter of Kathleen Watkins and Gay Byrne paid tribute to her “unbelievable” mother who passed away aged 90. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. “Her adoration for her grandchildren was renowned. When I announced to her that I was pregnant with Cian, she said at that time I will forever be known as Nana Kit now and from that day on she wouldn't answer to anything else,” said Suzy. “The children that they are, and the children that they have become, is so much down to her. She taught them their manners, she introduced them to music, she insisted that when we came back from London that they really should do speech and drama. “Her relationship with Cian, Siabh, Saoirse, Kate and Harry was phenomenal and they have benefited from her interest in them and her education of them”, she added. Ms Watkins was described by long term friend Maire-Louise O’Donnell as “possibly one of the most cultured people". Ms O’Donnell said she was always interested in culture, from theatre and film to poetry and language and in young people who were writing, singing and in the media. “She was very much a renaissance woman,” Ms O’Donnell said. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. In later years, Ms Watkins wrote a series of children’s books about a piglet character called Pigín, which won an Irish Book Award. In her final interview, with Sunday Independent journalist Barry Egan last September, Ms Watkins spoke openly about her life in the wake of her husband’s death and revealed that he had made plans for her funeral. She said she had picked the music and the prayers already. Speaking about the music, she said: “I have an idea but I won’t say. I would like Frank McNamara to be in charge of that. He was the musical director of The Late Late. He will know exactly what to do. I will leave instructions.” Taoiseach Simon Harris paid tribute to Ms Watkins in a statement this afternoon. "It is with great sadness that I have learned of the death of broadcaster and author Kathleen Watkins,” Mr Harris said. “Kathleen was a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “She was multi-talented in her own right, and indeed like many households around the country, her books and Pigín have a special place on the bookcase in my home. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss. “May she rest in peace.” Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl led tributes in the Dáil to Ms Watkins in the Dáil, describing her as a “national treasure.” She was “an inspiration to many to people of his generation”, he said. "We send our deepest sympathies on behalf of the House to her daughters and extended family.” Tánaiste Micheál Martin described Ms Watkins as a “famous musician, harpist, writer, and broadcaster.” He noted she was the first continuity announcer on RTÉ on the opening night of Teilifís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961 — 63 years ago. “I think she was an iconic figure in Irish broadcasting, and indeed, in terms of the history of modern broadcasting," Mr Martin said. “She was a dignified woman who made an outstanding contribution in her own right to the worlds of music, broadcasting, and latterly writing children's books ."
