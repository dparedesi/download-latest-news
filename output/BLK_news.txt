Title: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Lead To ‘Pain In Under 2 Years,’ Warns Arthur Hayes

In his latest essay entitled “The Genie,” crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes denounced calls for a United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR), warning that such a program would create “unnecessary pain in under two years” and transform the world’s largest cryptocurrency into a potent political weapon. Hayes also cautioned the industry against pursuing what he deems to be an overcomplicated “Frankenstein crypto regulatory bill,” which, he argues, would primarily benefit large centralized institutions rather than foster true decentralization. Hayes questions both the feasibility and the long-term consequences of establishing a national Bitcoin stockpile. He argues the US government would be motivated by politics rather than sound financial strategy, potentially leading to manipulation of the Bitcoin market. In his view, a BSR risks becoming a mechanism for politicians to raise funds for unrelated agendas: “Let’s assume that Trump is able to create a BSR. The government buys one million Bitcoin, as suggested by US Senator Lummis. Boom! The price goes nuts. Then, the buying concludes, and the up-only trend channel stops.” Hayes envisions a subsequent administration—one hostile to Bitcoin or crypto in general—deciding to liquidate this enormous reserve. “What if [the Democrats] got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … finding easy piles of cash to spend on goodies for their supporters is the first directive. There are one million Bitcoin just sitting there, ready to be sold… The market would rightly fear when and how these Bitcoin would be sold.” Another of Hayes’ key contentions is that regulation shaped by special interests could inadvertently stifle the very innovation it aims to promote. According to Hayes, large exchanges and financial intermediaries with the resources to influence lawmakers are more likely to drive regulatory outcomes. This, he suggests, will burden smaller innovators and strengthen the position of major centralized players: “The crypto regulatory wishes likely to be granted… will be in the form of overly complicated, prescriptive rules that only large and wealthy centralized companies can afford… Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? … Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and BlackRock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo.” Rather than a BSR, Hayes proposes a more radical and complex financial arrangement involving the US Treasury, Bitcoin, and “century bonds” (100-year zero-coupon bonds). His idea is for the US to unilaterally devalue its existing Treasury obligations by announcing that Bitcoin will replace sovereign debt as the neutral global reserve asset. The plan, in his own words, would involve a public statement from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, declaring the intention to use Bitcoin as the reserve asset while retaining the US dollar as the invoicing currency. Afterward, the Dollar would undergo a progressive devaluation, with the US Treasury bidding for Bitcoin at increasingly higher prices while issuing century bonds instead of immediate cash payouts. The next step would be extending the maturity of Treasury debt, with the Treasury selling Bitcoin at a profit to buy back and retire shorter-term obligations, ultimately pushing US debt maturity to 100 years. Additionally, global USD adoption would be accelerated through stablecoin transfers on social media platforms like Facebook and X, enabling everyday users to participate in US bond markets—bypassing conventional banking intermediaries. “That’s it for the financial history… The additional new goal is to make Bitcoin the global neutral reserve currency,” Hayes explains. He believes such a strategy could restore US hegemony by transitioning from the traditional “petrodollar” or “Treasury-based” system to one anchored in Bitcoin, all while ensuring large swaths of Bitcoin’s mining operations remain within US borders. In a more cautionary afterword, Hayes highlights that crypto voters played a notable role in returning Donald Trump and the Republican Party to power. Yet he stresses the slow pace of action on crypto issues, contrasting it with the administration’s rapid implementation of tariffs and rollbacks of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. “When Trump wants to act, he acts… The removal of ESG and DEI policies… came swiftly… That’s a shame because on the margin, the crypto single-issue voter put [the Republicans] in power.” He also reiterates his forecast that Bitcoin could see a sharp correction to a range of $70,000 to $75,000 before rallying higher in the long-term —if there is no immediate, concrete legislation favoring permissionless innovation or further monetary stimulus. For now, Hayes urges those “lining up day after day dressed in a seersucker suit or block heels and a summer dress hoping to ask the orange genie for a wish” to think carefully: “Stacking sats is my game, and I hope yours is too. Therefore, if you find yourself at the genie’s table… please wish for the right things.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,190.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-plans-to-launch-a-bitcoin-etp-in-europe/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T10:49:48Z

BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is gearing up to launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) in Europe, marking another significant step in the firm’s expansion into the cryptocurrency market. The new ETP product is set to be registered in Switzerland. This move follows the resounding success of BlackRock’s $58 billion US Bitcoin ETF. The success of BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which by early February 2025 had gathered $57.5 billion in net assets, speaks volumes about the investor appetite for such products. CEO Larry Fink’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement, suggesting a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value. This European venture is anticipated to attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. The decision to domicile the ETP in Switzerland was strategic, leveraging the country’s reputation as a hub for digital asset innovation, particularly within its “Crypto Valley” in Zug. Switzerland’s progressive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has made it an attractive location for BlackRock to extend its Bitcoin investment offerings beyond North American borders. The choice of Switzerland not only aligns with BlackRock’s aim to capitalize on crypto-friendly regulations but also positions the firm to lead in the European market. Notably, the plans to launch an ETP in Europe comes at a time when the European Union is navigating its own regulatory path through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was established in 2023. The MiCA framework aims to ensure consumer protection and market integrity, providing a stable environment for crypto investments. Despite the European crypto market capitalizing at $17.3 billion — far less than the US’s $116.4 billion — BlackRock’s move could significantly boost the sector. BlackRock’s entry into this market underscores the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, a trend that has been further propelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.

Title: BlackRock Said to be Preparing to Launch Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product in Europe

Photo Credit: Bloomberg BlackRock's IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of February 4 BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the US Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion (roughly Rs. 5,03,523 crore) as of February 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing US-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the US crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Most Promising Altcoins to Buy as First Avalance and Cardano ETPs Appear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-avalance-and-cardano-etps-appear/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:16:44Z

Swedish asset manager Virtune launched Avalanche ($AVAX) and Cardano ($ADA) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Finnish market. Previously, Virtue rolled out $BTC, $SOL, and XRP ETPs, as well as the Crypto Altcoin Index ETP, which gives exposure to the top 10 cryptos at once. The demand for crypto among European investors is evidently growing, which suggests the bull run is far from over. Virtue’s ETPs could push $AVAX and $ADA to new heights due to accelerated adoption and set a precedent for other fund managers to launch altcoin products. In light of this news, we share the five most promising altcoins to buy now. The market cap of Solana ecosystem tokens grew 120% last month alone. That’s a double-edged sword because Solana isn’t ready to handle such a surge in activity. Solaxy ($SOLX) could help Solana handle this ever-increasing workload by offloading part of transactions to its Layer-2 chain. In fact, this is the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that connected Solana with Ethereum. Solaxy’s goal is to speed up processing, lower fees, and eliminate congestion on the Solana mainnet. This would allow more projects to launch on Solana without compromising user experience. The project’s native token, $SOLX, is now available on presale at $0.001626, but the price will increase in 23 hours. Early adopters have invested $18.2M so far and staked 5B tokens at a 222% APY. Autonomous agents are a new wave of AI evolution. Unlike bots that only follow pre-programmed instructions, AI agents can make decisions, solve problems, and learn independently. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends this next-gen technology with the viral appeal of Pepe the Frog. As a self-sovereign agent, MIND of Pepe analyzes data from crypto aggregators and social media to gauge market trends and sentiment. As a result, MIND of Pepe can deliver unbiased, real-time trading insights to its community, engage in discussions with other users, and launch its own tokens. $MIND token holders will gain exclusive access to the agent’s knowledge and governance rights. With one token worth $0.0032662, now is the best time to join the community. Analysts expect $MIND to explode after major exchanges confirm its listings, so the first adopters are up for the highest returns. Best Wallet is the fastest-growing crypto wallet ecosystem currently on the market, rapidly approaching its goal of capturing 40% of the market by 2026. This non-custodial hit wallet lets you store (obviously), buy, sell, swap, and stake assets across several blockchains. But its standout feature is the Token Launchpad, which gives access to all of the best presales from one app. The $BEST token presale hit the ground running recently and already generated $9.2M in funding, most of which will go toward the platform’s improvement. With a price of $0.023875, set to increase in 13 hours, there will be no better time to secure your share of tokens than now. Litecoin ($LTC) struggled to reach its former highs in 2024, but 2025 might be different. The main catalyst for its anticipated growth is new $LTC ETPs in the US and European markets. US asset manager Canary Capital recently filed an application for an $LTC ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked it through the first stage of the review process, so it might launch in spring. $LTC is also part of Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP because it meets the strict criteria of the Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe index. Uniswap is the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) with an over $2T cumulative trading volume. Its native token, $UNI, is also featured in Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP and has a $5.6B market cap. $UNI is now trading -79.24% below its all-time high of $44.97 recorded in 2021. Yet, institutional capital inflows from products like Virtune’s ETP might revive the token and the entire Uniswap ecosystem. While Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently surpassed $UNI by market cap, the platform’s developments and institutional interest might drive it to new heights. The launch of altcoin ETPs attracts institutional capital into their respective ecosystems and the crypto industry as a whole. In the long term, this should drive innovation and increase crypto’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. This confidence trickles down to presales like Solaxy and Best Wallet Token, which can attract a wider pool of investors, including those previously hesitant to participate in early-stage projects. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. Even projects with strong fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meet Bob Steel, the Perella investment banker and former Treasury undersecretary who is advising Larry Fink on his alternative investment buying spree
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-steel-perella-weinberg-investment-banker-advising-blackrock-fink-alternatives-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Robert Steel has had the kind of career most people on Wall Street only dream about. He spent 30 years at powerhouse investment bank Goldman Sachs, where he rose to partner before "retiring" in 2004. In 2006, he became undersecretary of the US Treasury under President George W. Bush and helped prepare the government's response to what became the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. He stepped in as CEO of troubled bank Wachovia during the darkest days of that crisis and later served as Deputy Mayor for economic development of New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Since 2014, Steel has helped lead boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, first as CEO and now as vice chairman. Last year, he helped the firm score a role as a top advisor to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, in its expansion into alternative assets. Specifically, Steel worked with longtime friend Larry Fink on two recent acquisitions tied to BlackRock's expansion into investments traditionally reserved for the uberwealthy: Its $12.5 billion purchase of private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and its $12 billion purchase of private-credit giant HPS Investment Partners (HPS). Steel said BlackRock's latest acquisitions were driven by its leadership's conviction that time was of the essence. "I think the BlackRock people had what I would describe as a pretty courageous point of view that the opportunity was, for now, significant," he said, adding: "So they'd rather not take the time to build. They'd rather buy and be a strong participant right away." The spate of deals, including a $3.2-billion acquisition of data provider Preqin, has led some on Wall Street to describe Blackrock's ambitions as potentially game-changing. Marc Rowan, the CEO of private-equity giant Apollo Global Management, recently pointed to the deals as evidence of a new investment paradigm that will meld the realms of publicly traded stocks and bonds with so-called private investments. "Our industry grew up where I think people thought private was risky and public was safe," Rowan said on a quarterly earnings call. BlackRock, he added, "has delivered a wakeup call to their entire peer set that private is going to be an important part of client solutions going forward." Business Insider sat down with Steel to talk about his long and storied career, his recent work helping BlackRock expand into alternative assets, his advice to the next generation of bankers, and why retirement is not on his to-do list. Steel and Larry Fink, BlackRock's founder and CEO, have been friends for about 20 years. They first got to know each other around 2006, Steel said, while he was Treasury undersecretary in Washington. They've supported some of the same causes over the years, including as cosigners of a public letter in support of Mayor Adams' public safety and crime reduction efforts in 2022. They're also both on the executive committee of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that seeks to maintain the city's position as an economic and cultural hub. Steel said he got involved in Blackrock's expansion when Fink invited him and his team to assist with a non-alts project that "didn't come to fruition," without saying what it was. Steel and Perella soon became part of the team Fink relied on for advice about expanding into alternative assets. "When he was thinking about people to help with these transactions and give him advice, he thought of me and our firm," Steel said. Given Steel's long history with Wall Street, he ended up knowing people on both sides of the transactions. HPS was co-founded by Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, while GIP's chairman, Adebayo Ogunlesi, was previously a Goldman board member. "This was a case where I knew the people in BlackRock, I knew the people at GIP, and I knew the people at HPS," he told BI. "So I was involved intensely all the way through." In describing his role in the deals, he said: "I wasn't writing documents and arguing with lawyers, but I was basically trying to provide momentum to the transaction and to understand the pros and cons and the challenges. And I think I was pretty central to that." A BlackRock spokesman confirmed Perella's role in the HPS and GIP acquisitions and declined to comment on whether the firm plans to buy more companies in a space that Fink has called "critical" to the firm's growth. "Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets," Fink said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. "And blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities." Steel said he came from "a very middle-class background" in Durham, North Carolina, with no connections to Wall Street. As a student at nearby Duke University, he had little interest in finance. "I steered away from math and science and quantitative things in undergraduate school," said Steel, who majored in history and political science. Eventually, that changed. He started in institutional sales at Goldman Sachs in 1976 (and remedied his quantitative knowledge by enrolling in the University of Chicago's nighttime MBA program a few years later). Ever since, Steel said, the biggest theme of his career has been collaboration and teamwork. He pointed to the late 1980s, when he and his team at Goldman launched an ECM division in Europe, as an example. "The idea of setting strategy for equities and then finding the right people to help lead and execute that was pretty extraordinary," he said. "Goldman Sachs was not very well known in the continent, and we built businesses and built a brand, and I think were pretty successful." Steel was soon made a Goldman partner, and about six years later, he moved back to New York to co-lead the US Equities Division. "I was lucky enough to be in a place where the firm was growing and creating new opportunities where I don't think I had one job for 30 years — I think I had half a dozen jobs for five years," he said. While Goldman taught Steel teamwork, Washington DC taught him about working under fire. "You're doing a lot of things for the first time and you don't really know what's going to work, what's not going to work," he said. "So trying to figure that out so you can hopefully prevent something like a mean-spirited recession is a lot of responsibility, and so that was a pretty challenging time." Moving from the private to the public sector also required adjustments in other ways. He explained that authority in the corporate world is clearly assigned, ending with the CEO. In government, authority is shared due to checks and balances. "When you're solving the same puzzles in the public sector, that success generally comes more slowly and takes more time and often requires a bit of compromise — different than the corporate world," he said. Steel was CEO of Perella between 2014 and 2019, and the firm worked on some notable transactions during that time, including AT&T's $108.7 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2016 and iHeartMedia's $16 billion bankruptcy restructuring in 2019. As vice chairman, Steel is part of Perella's board of directors and helps with the strategic direction of the firm along with Chairman Peter Weinberg, a founding partner, and Andrew Bednar, who took over the CEO role from Weinberg in 2023. Although Steel, 73, has certainly earned the right to retire, he told BI he has zero interest in spending his days on a golf course or lounging at a beach. "I'll take time away over the holidays, but the idea of doing nothing seems pretty uninteresting," he said. "I think the goal is to wear out, not rust out." "I have friends that are really happy at a different rhythm, and I have no judgments," he said. "But it wouldn't be for me." Steel, however, appreciates the flexibility the pandemic has introduced to the corporate world, including banking. Early on in his career, he said, the pressure behind constant face time was, at times, overkill. "I think 'presentism' is maybe a bit overvalued. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be focused, committed, and available, but the idea that every day I had to be in before my boss and stay until after he left," he said, "I think that's moderated a bit, which I think is a good thing." His main advice to young people is to become an integral and irreplaceable part of your company or team. He said you must think beyond the day-to-day tasks to get there. "Thinking about how what you're doing fits into a bigger picture and understanding that perspective is a good tool," he said. Jump to

Title: Ruchii restaurant review: This neighbourhood Indian spot has the potential to become a foodie destination

I love a thali – tiny copper pots gleaming like a miniature banquet, each promising its own little world of flavour. But before I even get to order it at Ruchii, crisp poppadoms land on the table, accompanied by a green apple chutney – light, tart and clean – and a strawberry chutney that tastes unmistakably of the fruit itself. Both are made in-house, arriving as I’m still surveying the menu. Ruchii sits just off George’s Avenue in Blackrock, having relocated from its former perch above Conway’s pub. It’s now in a bigger space with a wilfully expansive menu and just enough gloss to remind you that its owners, Murali and Sateesh Sayana, have a clear vision for elevating Indian cuisine. The menu roams the subcontinent like a train on the Indian Railways: butter chicken and rogan josh from the north, dosas from the south, and the fiery Chettinad spice blends from Tamil Nadu rattling through the lot. This kind of range and variety could spell trouble for the kitchen, but it turns out to be no issue for the team of four Indian chefs, led by chef-patron Sateesh. Growing up in his father’s restaurant in Andhra Pradesh, Sateesh learned to mix idli and dosa batter as a child. Following professional stints in Jaipur and Agra, he moved to Dublin in 2002 to cook in Rasam, and has laid on feasts for everyone from the Indian prime minister to Cher. The soft-shell crab (€13.50) is a tasty starter, lightly battered and fried to a golden crunch. It is accompanied with chutneys and curry leaf mayonnaise, firmly anchoring it in the south Indian coastal tradition. The cocktails, however, are a little less precise. A margarita (€10.95) is overly sweet, missing that all-important sour-salty snap that keeps you coming back for another sip. Drinkable, yes, but not the cocktail you’d want paired with food this vibrant. Stick to beer or wine. The well-considered list focuses on aromatic, full-bodied options with enough weight for the dishes, though I remain unconvinced that wine is the ideal match for Indian food. The fish curry (€22.50) features large, fresh chunks of cod cloaked in ginger, garlic, mustard seed and that floral hit of pathar ke phool, all luxuriating in a creamy coconut sauce. We’ve paired it with pilau rice (€3), fragrant with rosewater and topped with fried onions, alongside wonderful garlic naan – hot from the tandoor, steaming and lavishly slathered in ghee. [ Firebyrd takeaway review: Nashville fried chicken rules the roost at this D6 restaurantOpens in new window ] Then comes the thali (€33), the main event, a copper tray bristling with little pots arranged in perfect order. Inspired by the six primary tastes of Indian culinary tradition – salt, sour, sweet, bitter, astringent and pungent – it’s as much a lesson in balance as it is a meal. Salty richness is found in the dal Makhani. It is made from urad lentils and is less buttery than you may find elsewhere, but is slow-cooked to bring an earthy depth. The creamy tomato sauce in the butter chicken brings a delicate sweetness in a base so velvety you could wear it, while the tender lamb pieces in the rogan josh hum with the pungency of toasted fennel and the warmth of cardamom. The spinach, which is rich and creamy, is cooked with fenugreek to bring a subtle bitterness to the dish; and the prawns, in a coconut-based sauce, get a touch of sourness from tamarind and raw mango. It’s one of those sauces you find yourself finishing long after the prawns are gone, wishing there were more as it lingers on the palate, allowing the spicy heat to build. A brightly coloured beetroot raita is subtly sweet and refreshing. Dessert is a lentil doughnut drowning in jaggery syrup, unapologetically sweet and defiantly sticky. It’s exactly the type of ending you’d expect from an Indian meal – traditional and indulgent. Ruchii’s menu reflects India’s culinary diversity, with its extensive selection offering something for everyone. It’s a mix of the comforting and the challenging, the traditional and the experimental. For a suburban spot, it punches above its weight – a bold attempt to cram the breadth of Indian cuisine into a single menu. It’s also an invitation: to explore, to taste and to learn about the rich histories and traditions that shape each dish. With thoughtful execution, such a menu has the potential to elevate this neighbourhood spot into a genuine destination for Indian food enthusiasts. I, for one, will be back to explore more. Dinner for two with a cocktail and two beers was €99.95. The verdict An extensive menu of tasty Indian dishes. Food provenance Irish Country Meats, Gahan Meats, Keelings and Kish Fish. Vegetarian options Palak kofta, Kadai paneer, dal, baby aubergines in a curry sauce, and thali. Wheelchair access Fully accessible with an accessible toilet. Music Bollywood music in the background.

Title: What 2025 Has in Store For The Future of ESG

Once a corporate imperative, the ESG movement is now facing mounting backlash, forcing companies and investors to rethink their approach. What is the future of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance)? The global craze of companies, countries, investors and regulators wanting to achieve sustainability goals based on environmental, social and governance benchmarks is now facing strong headwinds. Despite clear evidence that the world faces growing threats from climate change, rising social inequality and shaky governance, many of the actors that had been strong advocates for ESG are retreating from their stated aims. Consider these recent developments: First, The US has (once again) withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, leading other major countries such as Indonesia to doubt the credibility of the climate targets set in Paris. Then there is growing pushback from major companies in the EU around the EU ESG Taxonomy, saying it makes them globally uncompetitive and raises their cost of capital. More and more companies are scaling back or abandoning their ESG targets as they realise it is either too unrealistic, too expensive or politically unwise to stay the course. ESG funds, long the darling of investors, have underperformed in investment returns compared to non-ESG funds in recent years and also saw an outflow of funds; Blackrock, the “cheerleader“ for the ESG investing movement, has walked away from a number of its ESG ambitions. DEI programs in rich, mainly Western countries are coming under fire and many such initiatives are being phased out. So, is the ESG movement over? Not really. ESG will continue to evolve in new ways despite these headwinds. In fact, in some ways these current developments could help usher in a newer, better form of ESG: call it ESG 2.0. What would ESG 2.0 look like? Here are some likely scenarios: First, companies will continue to make investments in ESG but will measure tangible financial returns before they make these investments; these returns will include calculating the reduction in cost of funding (especially in developing countries), monetising decarbonisation efforts through carbon credits, achieving lasting operating cost reductions, and so on. Next, regulators will shift the emphasis away from “compliance” based ESG, ie submitting reports, to “enforcement“ based ESG where bad actors will face sanctions in the form of higher taxes, fines or loss of licenses. All investors, regardless of whether they have an explicit ESG focus, will integrate ESG considerations into their investment decisions but will do so by factoring in climate, social and other externalities that directly impact the value of their investment. Then you have new stakeholder alliances involving NGOs, the media, the legal profession, and ordinary citizens will harness the power of AI and the information revolution to mount more targeted campaigns against companies that are bad actors. In many ways, all these scenarios are already playing out. Climate lawsuits led by stakeholders against fossil fuel companies are happening with more frequency than ever in various courtrooms around the world. More and more governments are implementing carbon and other natural resource taxes. More and more “green transition“ funds are available to governments and companies for developing countries under the COP framework that are committed to meeting these goals. Investors are nervous about “climate-related bankruptcies” like Pacific Gas & Electric and are actively investing in tools to quantify such risks. Welcome to the new world of ESG, against a daunting backdrop of a burning world! Let’s hope it succeeds this time! Ravi Chidambaram is the founder & CEO of RIMM Sustainability, a Singapore-based global provider of ESG software solutions for enterprises. He has many years of experience as an entrepreneur, lecturer and thought leader in both the corporate finance and sustainability field as founder of TC Capital, Adjunct Professor at Yale NUS College and RIMM.

Title: BlackRock Set To Launch Bitcoin-Linked ETF In Europe Following US Success

In a significant development for the Bitcoin (BTC) market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to introduce an exchange-traded Fund (ETF) directly tied to BTC in Europe. This move follows the success of its $58 billion US ETF that tracks the market’s leading cryptocurrency, underscoring BlackRock’s commitment to expanding its footprint in the digital asset space. According to Bloomberg, the new fund is expected to be domiciled in Switzerland. BlackRock could begin marketing the fund as soon as this month, marking a pivotal moment in the firm’s venture into European cryptocurrency products. While ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies have been available on European exchanges for several years, this will be BlackRock’s first crypto-linked ETF outside of North America. As a leader in the issuance of exchange-traded funds, BlackRock manages over $4.4 trillion in assets across various products. The firm has emerged as a prominent supporter of the digital asset class, with CEO Larry Fink recently highlighting Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The launch of several US ETFs tied to Bitcoin last year ignited substantial demand for the asset class, leading to an influx of $116 billion across 12 funds to date, according to Bloomberg data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker IBIT) has notably set industry records, boasting the highest-performing debut of any Exchange-Traded Fund in history. The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally since the election of US President Donald Trump, with Bitcoin reaching a record high of $109,241 in January. The increasing interest from financial institutions is fueled by Trump’s vocal support for the industry and the promise of forthcoming regulations that could provide clearer guidelines for firms navigating the crypto landscape. New regulations for cryptocurrencies also went into effect in the European Union (EU) in late December 2024, further encouraging institutional participation. Despite the competitive landscape, with over 160 cryptocurrency ETPs currently available in Europe tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens, the overall market size of $17.3 billion remains modest compared to the robust US market. In a recent blog post, BlackRock executives Samara Cohen and Jay Jacobs noted that the combination of gaining Bitcoin exposure through the ETF wrapper has proven to be an appealing option for investors. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has fallen to the $96,770 mark, losing the key $100,000 level after experiencing a 7% price drop over the weekly time frame.

Asset management titan BlackRock is reportedly going to list a new spot market Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, its first digital asset-related venture into the continent. According to a new report from Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – is getting ready to launch a BTC ETP in Europe after its US iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) was a massive success. Anonymous people familiar with the matter say that the ETP will be based out of Switzerland and that BlackRock could start advertising the fund as soon as sometime this month. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and ETPs allow traders to expose themselves to assets – such as precious metals and crypto – without having to actually physically purchase them. BlackRock first launched IBIT in January 2024 after years of having its bid delayed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Previously, Bloomberg found that IBIT had the best debut out of all other US BTC ETFs. At the time, it was found that IBIT held more assets than BlackRock’s Gold ETF despite it being launched nearly two decades earlier in 2005. According to BlackRock’s official website, the net assets of IBIT are $57.4 billion while Bloomberg reports that Europe’s total crypto ETP market is sized at around $17.3 billion. IBIT is trading for $56.09 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day while the top crypto asset by market cap is valued at $98,146.

Or Bitcoin and gold? Investors are weighing where to put their money in times of uncertainty—and no time is more uncertain than now. President Donald Trump’s tariffs—or threats of tariffs—have rocked markets, making “risk-on” assets like crypto less appealing. The price of gold hit a new high Monday, while Bitcoin dropped below $93,000, down about 14% from its all-time high price set on January 20. Bitcoin's correlation to the precious metal is down significantly as investors flock to more traditional safe haven assets, experts told Decrypt. Bitcoin proponents have long claimed that the cryptocurrency’s unique selling point is that it’s a long-term store of value—like gold. And sometimes, they are correlated: The two assets have moved in tandem in the past, when investors have flocked to a strong dollar. But things are up in the air now that President Donald Trump has taken office and issued a flurry of dramatic orders, and Bitcoin’s 90-day correlation with gold has remained close to zero, data provider Kaiko told Decrypt. Case in point: The new commander in chief implemented tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China on Saturday, causing crypto prices to drop sharply. After having a “friendly conversation” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum two days later, he decided to pause tariffs—leading to a rebound in Bitcoin’s price. Meanwhile, gold soared. Trump later agreed to a similar pause with Canada as the two countries attempt to work out a deal, while tariffs against China ultimately did go into effect. “The trade war could decouple the correlation in the short term as gold is a more established ‘safe haven’ asset, while Bitcoin—although often seen as a safe haven—is currently owned by a large investor base also trading highly speculative risk-asset meme coins and tech stocks,” Amberdata’s director of derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt. The reason for the decoupling is that Bitcoin is still performing less like a safe-haven and more like risk assets, such as tech stocks. The biggest cryptocurrency by market cap over the past seven days alone has swung from $105,893 per coin to as low as $92,876, CoinGecko shows. “While Bitcoin has indisputably drawn investors as a similarly alternative store of value, its higher volatility makes it less reliable in times of economic uncertainty compared to gold,” Michael Petch, co-founder and president of gold investment platform Argo, told Decrypt. Bitcoin as an asset is still finding its feet, say some (including Wall Street titan BlackRock), and even though its long-term gains by far outmatch gold, for now the 5,000-year old physical asset is still the go-to safe haven during times of chaos. “Investors don’t like uncertainty and Donald Trump brings a lot of uncertainty,” RIA Advisors portfolio manager Michael Lebowitz told Decrypt.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The shares of Kyndryl (KD) are advancing 6% after Scotiabank increased its price target on the tech name to $45 from $35. The cloud services company was spun off from IBM (IBM) in 2021. Why Scotiabank Is Bullish on KD The bank raised its price target on KD after it unveiled higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings per share and in-line fiscal Q3 sales on Monday. Scotiabank kept an Outperform rating on KD. A data analyst in a lab monitoring a cloud-based software system to detect cardiac disease. Scotiabank believes that Kyndryl's embrace of automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics has helped the firm increase its profit margins and create value for investors. The bank noted that KD's consulting business, driven by the rapid proliferation of AI and cloud security systems, is expanding by double-digit percentage levels. The latter unit's growth, in turn, is creating new opportunities for its Managed Services unit, according to Scotiabank. The bank believes that the company is well-managed, while its services are necessary for its customers, leaving it largely insulated from negative macroeconomic catalysts. More Information About KD Analysts on average expect KD's earnings per share to climb to $1.23 this year from a per-share loss of 11 cents in 2024. In the last month, the shares have gained 13%, while they have soared 77% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of KD, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The largest asset manager in the world is buying the Ethereum dip to custody funds for its ETH-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to BlackRock’s data, the firm picked up 100,535 ETH – worth about $276.2 million at time of writing – for its iShares ETHA product. BlackRock holds a total of 1,352,934 ETH worth roughly $3.71 billion, and the financial giant’s total assets under management were reported to be around $11.5 trillion in October of last year. And according to on-chain data, the President of the United States’ crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is also accumulating Ethereum, with blockchain “de-anonymizing” platform Arkham reporting that WLFI also purchased over $307 million worth of ETH and Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) and sent it to Coinbase Prime for management purposes. In a recent strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe told his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. The analyst gave a price target of $20,000 for ETH. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000.

The Canadian ETP is a wrapper for IBIT, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) available in the US. However, Seyffart noted that such a move would have a low chance of success in Europe. Seyffart highlighted that BlackRock Bitcoin ETPs in the US and Canada have fees of 25 basis points and 32 basis points (bps), respectively. Notably, European products already offer exposure to BTC through funds carrying a 25 bps fee. Eric Balchunas also showed interest in seeing the fees charged by BlackRock in Europe. He explained that the US is commonly the best in the rest of the world in terms of cost and liquidity. Balchunas added: “Either way shows commitment from world’s biggest asset manager who has big presence overseas.” The European market for crypto ETPs includes more than 160 products that track Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and other digital assets. The market’s cumulative value is $17.3 billion. Balchunas highlighted that the European crypto ETF landscape is “barely on [the] leaderboard,” as the US spot Bitcoin ETFs represent 91% of the global share. He assessed that BlackRock had a chance to succeed by bringing the “US Terrordome” to Europe. Yet, Balchunas noted that European investors, unlike US and Asian investors, have less appetite for riskier investment products. According to Farside Investors data, IBIT recorded $40.7 billion in net inflows as of Feb. 4. Its inflows are over three times larger than Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot Bitcoin ETF.

By Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of Feb. 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing U.S.-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the U.S. crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation.

Title: Blackrock Plans to Launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe: Bloomberg

The world's largest asset management firm with more than $10 trillion in AUM, Blackrock (BLK) plans on listing a bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) in Europe, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. The fund would be based in Switzerland and BlackRock could start marketing it as soon as this month, according to the report. This would be the giant asset manager's first crypto-linked ETP outside of America. Blackrock's U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a wild success, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets in just more than one year since opening for business. BlackRock's move would be the latest in a string of investment firms looking to dive further into providing crypto-backed securities in Europe. Kraken recently secured a license that will enable it to offer derivatives, joining others like Bitstamp and FTX EU. The company's entry into the European crypto ETP ecosystem could further fuel the competitive response that’s been seen among various providers, which include fee waivers on several products, some expense fees for ETP's have been as high as 2.5%. In the U.S., a similar competitive response came after these funds were launched in Jan. 2024. A lot of question marks still occur around this product, including the fee structure, which would have big implications for the performance of the ETP. “Don't know the fee yet, that will be a big variable," said Senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. "U.S. ETFs blow away the rest of the world in cost and liquidity but either way shows commitment from the world's biggest asset manager who has a big presence overseas." U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs currently have 91% of the world market, said Balchunas. Blackrock did not comment before press time. Camomile Shumba is a CoinDesk regulatory reporter based in the UK.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch Bitcoin ETP in Europe as soon as this month after US success

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock is poised to expand its crypto product line with the launch of a Bitcoin ETP in Europe, capitalizing on the runaway success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the plans. Projected to be based in Switzerland, the planned fund would be BlackRock’s first crypto ETP in the European market. The world’s leading asset manager, which previously focused on North America, launched the IBIT fund and subsequently introduced its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The new ETP may debut as soon as this month, sources said. BlackRock’s IBIT has become one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs since its launch last January, accumulating approximately $58 billion worth of Bitcoin as of February 4. The fund ranks as the 31st largest ETF globally across all categories, including traditional finance products, according to VettaFi. IBIT has led the spot Bitcoin ETF market with a five-day winning streak, attracting nearly $934 million in net inflows since January 30. Yesterday’s inflows alone totaled approximately $249 million, driving most of the spot Bitcoin ETF market’s gains, according to data from Farside Investors. The European crypto ETP market currently features more than 160 products tracking various digital assets, though its size remains smaller than the US market. The expansion comes as Bitcoin has reached new highs this year, amid increased regulatory clarity following the EU’s implementation of new crypto rules. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart initially speculated that BlackRock might consider replicating its Canadian Bitcoin ETF structure in Europe using a “wrapper” approach, where the ETF holds shares of its US-listed IBIT. However, he swiftly confirmed that this strategy is unlikely to be allowed under EU regulations. Sources told him that EU regulators are poised to reject such a workaround, likely requiring BlackRock to launch a standalone European Bitcoin ETF. This necessitates a different approach and puts the spotlight squarely on fees. “I have been informed that this is unlikely to be allowed in EU. So will be interesting to see what they charge assuming they launch a standalone product. In the US the total cost is 25 bps. Canada is 32 bps,” he wrote on X. “There’s already products at 25 bps and lower in Europe including Valour who has a zero expense ratio product.” Beyond regulatory hurdles and pricing pressures, BlackRock faces a more fundamental challenge: market size and investor appetite, Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s fellow Bloomberg ETF analyst, shared in a comment. The US spot Bitcoin ETF market, despite being just a year old, has exploded in popularity, capturing a staggering 91% of global market share. Europe, by contrast, lags considerably. While European investors are sophisticated, they have historically shown less enthusiasm for the high-octane investment products that have resonated with US investors.

Title: Ondo launches blockchain platform to tokenize US stocks for global investors

Ondo GM will provide exposure to Apple, Tesla, SPDR, and more with stablecoin transactions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance has introduced Ondo Global Markets (Ondo GM), a platform designed to bring real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto the blockchain. According to a Feb. 4 statement, this move provides global access to US securities by enabling investors outside the US to gain exposure through tokenized representations of these assets. It stated: “With Ondo GM, anyone outside the US in eligible geographies can get exposure to thousands of US securities—AAPL, TSLA, SPY, QQQ, etc.—with minimal fees using stablecoins, removing traditional cost and geographic barriers.” The company said that the token issued through Ondo GM maintains a 1:1 backing with its underlying security, ensuring legitimacy and transparency. It noted that these tokens function similarly to stablecoins, facilitating seamless transfers across blockchain networks beyond US borders. Ondo furthered that investors benefit from instant minting and redemption, enhanced liquidity, and built-in access to on-chain financial services, including lending, trading, and yield-generation opportunities. Ondo added: “Ondo GM will propel financial markets into the open economy, returning power to stakeholders to make their own decisions and compete on a level playing field, while addressing challenges like high fees, limited availability, and transfer frictions.” To support broader adoption, Ondo GM provides comprehensive APIs that enable brokers, asset issuers, and fintech platforms to integrate tokenized assets into their systems. Additionally, a legal framework ensures investor protection, safeguarding assets with a structured approach that minimizes risk. Ondo’s move comes as the RWA sector has experienced remarkable growth, reaching an all-time high of $16.88 billion in on-chain value. Data from RWA.xyz reveals a 94% increase over the past year, with nearly $4 billion added in the last three months alone. There are now 83,049 entities holding RWAs, collectively managing assets issued by 112 providers. Private credit leads the market with $11.6 billion in tokenized value, followed by US Treasury debt ($3.5 billion) and commodities ($1.1 billion). Institutional funds represent a smaller portion, valued at around $410 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for RWAs, hosting 67 asset tokens, while zkSync (28) and Arbitrum (20) follow closely. The surge in RWA adoption aligns with growing interest from traditional financial institutions. Traditional financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have deepened their involvement in tokenized finance, signaling a shift toward blockchain-powered investment solutions.

Title: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge 175% Year-Over-Year

Full Content:
U.S.-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a 175% year-over-year increase in almost the first three weeks of trading. In 2025, from Jan. 13 to Feb. 5, net inflows equaled $4.4 billion, while the 2024 net inflows for the first three weeks equaled $1.6 billion. The spot bitcoin ETFs were one of the most successful ETF launches of all time, and have accumulated over $40.6 billion in total net inflows. In the same time, BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) has seen a total of $40.7 billion in net inflows. While the total net inflow for all 11 spot BTC ETFs is $40.6 billion, due to Grayscale GBTC witnessing outflows of $21.9 billion. To determine whether these inflows reflect a directional long position or are part of a basis trade—where an investor goes long on the underlying asset in the spot market while simultaneously selling futures contracts when they trade at a premium to spot. Currently, investors can capture a premium of approximately 10%, which will eventually diminish as the spot price converges with the futures contract's expiry. According to Glassnode data, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary venue for such trades, has seen a year-to-date decline in open interest from 180,099 BTC to 168,549 BTC, suggesting that these inflows are not primarily driven by basis trading.

Valerie Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented: "2024 was a year of record financial performance, underpinned by our increasingly diversified business model and driven by strong business income and sustained interest income. Our strategy and new management structure puts clients at the centre of our plans, and we continue to make progress against our key objectives. In 2024, we grew our funds business and European presence through the announced acquisition of Inversis in Spain. We also continue to support market adoption of digital assets by attracting new issuances on our D-SI platform while participating in important projects with industry partners to drive innovation across European post-trade. Our core activities continue to thrive. We have reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody closing the year over the €40 trillion mark. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway is now close to €2 trillion, while the funds depot also hit a new high of 3.6 trillion." Business performance The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period.

Settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity throughout the year. Boosted by the ETF activity, combined with the rise in equity markets, fund assets under custody reached the record level of €3.6 trillion. The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now close to its prior peak level. Business milestones Advancing the funds business Over the past years, Euroclear's funds offering has evolved rapidly thanks to acquisitions such as MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2024, major clients in Asia, Europe and the US, including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess), Blackrock, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing their clients to have access to more than 250,000 funds. In 2024, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES, a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models. In July 2024, Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis, Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market. In Asia, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode, a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode, Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology. Reshaping traditional financial services Euroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024, Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council, it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold, Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace, Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC. Streamlined management structure Following the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new, expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients, business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally. Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impact Euroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation, Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues. The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme, long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations. Russian sanctions impacts Financial impacts of the Russian assets Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business. As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion, of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets. In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment. Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements, Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Issued on 16 December 2024, the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients. Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations. As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below. The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024. The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend. Euroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Title: South Dublin soccer club blaming council policy shift for sidelining 20-year clubhouse campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/04/south-dublin-soccer-club-blaming-council-policy-shift-for-sidelining-20-year-clubhouse-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A 20-year campaign by a football club in south Co Dublin to get itself a new clubhouse is set to rumble on after it deferred its latest bid for planning permission having been told by local council officials it would not be successful. It is two decades since what is now Sallynoggin Pearse first approached Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council intending to replace its old and deteriorating clubhouse, its officials say. At the time, the local authority said its preference was to relocate the club around the corner from Pearse Park to Sallynoggin Park where they would be given access to a new facility which was then in the planning stage. Planning permission was subsequently obtained in 2007 but the project never went ahead and the then Pearse Rovers stayed where they were. By 2018 relocating the club became a priority when its existing clubhouse was vandalised. After the council initially said again it would build a new clubhouse in Sallynoggin Park if the club gave up its legal claim to a pitch a local land owner had allowed them to start using almost 50 years earlier, a deal was eventually agreed based on the club funding construction and the council proving the long term lease required to secure grants and loans once the project was in train. Since then, club chairman Richie Cummins says the club has deferred making of planning applications three times at the council’s suggestion. And it was told at a meeting in November the local authority would not now be honouring its commitment to the long-term lease. “The pre-planning stuff was all positive,” he says. “We are meeting the criteria for mixed-use facilities, not-for-profit groups sharing the facilities with sports groups. We’re ticking all the boxes. There is no issue with the building, no issue with the location of the building. So, we’re at a loss as to what the big issue is here.” Sallynoggin Pearse, the product of a 2010 merger between Pearse Rovers, where Paul McGrath played as a teenager (the hope is to name the clubhouse in his honour), and Sallynoggin Celtic, is a relatively small club. It has just two adult men’s teams, although Cummins makes the point it used to be much bigger and could grow again if it had more certainty over its future facilities. What it has done, however, is form a partnership with Granada FC, which has 90 teams and 1,500 young players. It hopes to use the new clubhouse along with a boxing club and kick-boxing club. Dublin Fire Brigade sports club are interested, a local gardening group would like to use it, and there is talk of a dancing club too. “It’s not just football,” says Cummins. “There’d be other groups using it which is important. The crime prevention officer from Dún Laoghaire said our current building (a 40ft shipping container) was vandalised and the previous building was vandalised because of not being used enough. But the council have used it as another excuse not to support us, saying we are looking for a community centre rather than a sports facility. We have never used that term but we do want something that is of benefit to the community.” He gives a vivid account of dealing with council officialdom, with everything — people, policies, allocated plots of land and pitch allocations — shifting over time. At one point, he and fellow club committee members Shane O’Brien and Paul Bishop say it was suggested they get a solicitor’s letter written to inject urgency into the council’s position — only for the official who had suggested it to stop engaging because they had “gone legal”. The council’s current offer is a vandal proof prefab which, the club was told, would cost more than €200,000 but contain just two dressingrooms and no showers. “Are you really expecting teenage girls to share that with either teenage boys or men?,” asks Granada chairman Ciarán Kane, who says wider frustration with the council over facilities and pitches in particular, has prompted clubs across the area to set aside their rivalries to co-ordinate their campaign for improvements. The lack of joined-up thinking, he says, is also evident in his own club’s home facility in Blackrock which, he says, they are delighted to have but which they have been told they should not make available to community groups during weekdays when it is underutilised. Sallynoggin Pearse might settle for that but instead find themselves frustrated by a shift in council policy which, says Cummins, involves a move away from granting long-term leases to clubs. He cites a recent example of that happening to another club. “We’re not asking them for a penny,” he says. “Just that they honour the commitment they gave us when we gave up our claim to a pitch they wanted. They are creating a situation here where nobody can trust them.” The club has, he says, widespread support among councillors and local TD Richard Boyd Barrett describes the council’s treatment of the club as “shameful” and “inexplicable”. “You would think they would be encouraging projects like this but instead they are putting obstacles in their way. It’s hard to understand, but it’s not unique, I’m not exaggerating when I say I am inundated with clubs in the area raising issues over facilities, pitches and particularly all-weather pitches,” said the People Before Profit–Solidarity TD.

Title: Dublin 8 build-to-rent scheme readies €80m sale

Strong interest is expected in the upcoming forward purchase sale of 18 Newmarket Square, one of the few build-to-rent developments expected to come to market this year. It’s understood the development of more than 130 apartments in the Liberties in Dublin 8, which is still under construction, will be brought to the market by CBRE in the first quarter of this year at an asking price of about €80 million. 18 Newmarket Square, which is expected to complete around September of this year, was developed by Revelate Capital, an Irish specialist private equity real estate business, along with Valpre Capital, a London-based private equity real estate investment firm and a UBS-owned real estate platform, Aventicum Real Estate. It is located around a 10-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green and amenities are expected to include a co-working lounge, communal rooftop gardens and a landscaped courtyard, as well as about 500sq m of retail space. The Liberties development is not the only deal of scale coming to the market this year; the sale of a large city centre asset is also due to be announced, with an asking price expected to be in the region of €180 million. Last year residential transactions remained low, at about €466 million – the largest deal was the €150 million sale of the Point Campus student accommodation by German asset manager DWS. It was acquired by US fund Greystar. Developers say issues such as the rent cap, which is up for review at the end of the year, is a factor in the lack of new private rented sector developments. Other residential developments expected to complete this year include Marlet’s Claremont development of more than 500 units in Howth, north Dublin, and Lioncor’s development at Alta Verde in Blackrock, in the south of the city.

(Reuters) -Blackrock plans to hire nearly 1,200 people to expand its two support hubs in India, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The world's largest asset manager wants to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities in India with the expansion, the report added. The iHubs, as the centers are known, are in the country's financial hub Mumbai and Gurugram, which is near the national capital New Delhi. The new hires will increase total headcount to roughly 3,500 in the two cities, and include more engineers and data experts, according to the report. Blackrock is also inheriting a so-called global capabilities center in India's IT hub Bengaluru, through its proposed deal to acquire data provider Preqin, Bloomberg reported. That center will have roughly 1,500 staff members. Blackrock did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Title: This quiet college hamlet has been named named the next boomtown in America
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/real-estate/this-is-the-biggest-boomtown-in-america/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T21:44:24Z

A town just 15 miles west of Boston has officially been named Massachusetts’ biggest boomtown, proving that rapid growth and prosperity aren’t just reserved for the state’s major cities. Wellesley, best known for its prestigious women’s liberal arts college Wellesley College, has emerged as the Bay State’s fastest-growing community, with residents raking in an average income of at least $110,000. The town’s rapid ascent to the top was confirmed by a recent ranking from GoBankingRates, which analyzed economic expansion, population growth and housing market trends. This designation marks a shift in the state’s economic landscape, as Worcester, a central Massachusetts city, held the title just two years ago. So what’s behind Wellesley’s meteoric rise? The town’s upward trajectory didn’t happen overnight. Wellesley has long been a haven for affluence, with stately homes and meticulously landscaped properties dotting its tree-lined streets. By 1880, the town was already flourishing, introducing its first newspaper, bank and telephone service as its population surged. Local leaders ensured that progress remained steady, embracing modern conveniences early on. “The citizens of the town of Wellesley, both collectively and individually, are constantly endeavoring to obtain for their town, their homes and themselves all that is best from Nature and Art,” an article from 1906 declared. Even before the turn of the 20th century, Wellesley boasted a thriving railroad network, Massachusetts’ first golf course, a robust water system and a slew of town improvement initiatives. By the 1920s, it had already solidified its status as one of Greater Boston’s premier suburban enclaves. Wellesley’s population has steadily increased, growing 3.4% since 2014 to reach 29,862 residents. Housing demand has followed suit — occupied housing units have risen by 4%, while owner-occupied homes have seen a 6.1% uptick. But the real jaw-dropper is the town’s per-capita income, which has skyrocketed by 35.8%, now sitting at a minimum of $111,690. This economic boom has been largely fueled by Wellesley’s exceptional public school system, consistently ranked among the top 10 in Massachusetts. Families flock to the town for its educational excellence, as well as its proximity to elite private schools Of course, no discussion of Wellesley’s success is complete without mentioning Wellesley College, a globally recognized institution that has produced some of the most influential women in history. For nearly 150 years, the school has educated trailblazers across politics, media, finance and science. “Pioneering scientists, environmental revolutionaries, US secretaries of state, civil rights activists, investment trailblazers, network news producers and genre-defying activists” have all walked its halls, according to the college’s website. Among its most distinguished alumni are Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Diane Sawyer and BlackRock co-founder — and business-world titan — Susan Wagner. Others, like Winifred Edgerton Merrill — the first woman in the US to earn a PhD in mathematics — and Eleanor Raymond, the architect behind the nation’s first solar-powered home, have made history in their respective fields. With prosperity comes exclusivity, and Wellesley’s real estate market reflects its elite status. As of January, the median home price in town stood at a staggering $1.97 million, according to Building A Better Wellesley. Despite its modern wealth, the town’s character has remained largely unchanged since the early 20th century. A quote from over a century ago still rings true today: “Fine old trees line the roads; handsome buildings have been erected for the public schools; even the railroad stations are objects of beauty … Wellesley, a residential village with no manufacturing, has long been noted for its pure water and invigorating air.” Advertisement

Title: Shayne Bolton’s arrival in Ireland squad could give UK press a fit of the vapours
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/04/shayne-boltons-arrival-in-ireland-squad-could-give-uk-press-a-fit-of-the-vapours/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T20:44:42Z
Full Content:
Readers of UK Sunday papers might have thought this week that it was a case of right-back-at-ya from Irish rugby. The pithy observation of Sunday Times rugby correspondent Stephen Jones that Ireland “thrived on the needle-sharp incisiveness of Jamison Gibson-Park at scrumhalf, James Lowe on the wing, Mack Hansen on the other wing, Bundee Aki in midfield – and they were also well served by the odd Irish-born player” was met with this week’s announcement that Connacht’s Shayne Bolton and Munster’s Tom Ahern were to come in to the Irish squad. The truth is that the remark and the pair’s arrival into the Irish camp was a coincidence. But it has played out sweetly as Bolton, coming in for the injured Hansen, is an Irish-qualified player who was born in Pretoria, South Africa. It is not Bolton’s first breath of the thin air of a national squad. He was included by Simon Easterby in last year’s Emerging Ireland squad, only for an injury in the 33rd minute of Connacht’s opening URC game against Munster in Thomond Park to force him out of that tour. Irish-qualified through his grandmother, Bolton has been with Connacht since 2021 and last March signed a contract that would keep him in Galway for two more years until 2026. In November, Connacht coach Pete Wilkins spoke of the qualities that have made him a favourite in Dexcom Stadium. [ Shayne Bolton’s journey from South Africa can see him flourish with ConnachtOpens in new window ] “We’re delighted with the progress Shayne has made this season, and he is rightly establishing himself in the team as a fast and powerful option on the wing,” he said. “I am excited about his potential for further development over the next two years and he is another great example of the type of player that our supporters are so excited to watch and get behind.” Wilkins might have added that lightning pace also comes with the 24-year-old. Far from being a rangy winger, Bolton arrives compact at about 100kg and strong enough to also play in the centre. He joins that subset of players in the Irish squad that can seamlessly move around positions, as Garry Ringrose did last weekend against England. Ringrose switched from 13 to the wing when Hansen went off in the first half and reverted to the outside centre when the Australian-born winger returned. The move will probably excite a lot of people and even if it is only for a few days, it will be seen as an opportunity for Bolton to pick up the mood and character of life in the Irish camp. He was contacted initially in South Africa by Andy Friend, who was then the Connacht head coach. Friend knew the then 20-year-old was Irish qualified and that the pursuit of his dream to play professional rugby was greater than his desire to stay in college. In an interview in this paper last year, Bolton described how he left South Africa for the first time to travel alone to a country he didn’t know much about. It was during the Covid pandemic of 2020, and the aeroplane was ghostly empty. He had a row of seats to himself and everyone on board was wearing a protective mask, so there were zero conversations. When he arrived, the warm Irish welcome was quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because he was arriving from a red-listed country. At the time countries were listed as green, amber or red, with different safety protocols around each colour. The youngest of five children, Bolton was offered bursaries and scholarships but because his parents did not want to send him away to boarding school, he went to one close to where he lived. He played age-grade rugby for the Bulls at under-16 and under-18 and was in the Cheetahs academy for two years. However, he was denied an extension with the Bloemfontein franchise, although continued to play for the University of the Free State in the Varsity Cup. [ Connacht sign Irish-qualified South African prodigy Shayne BoltonOpens in new window ] In hindsight, timing was good, and it was when he was playing college rugby that the phone call arrived from Friend. “I’m very close to my gran,” he said in November. “She lives close by to my parents in South Africa, and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday, and I was always aware that my family comes from here. Her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” Gran is Noreen Stapleton, who originally came from the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. She can be proud that her grandson has already been charming people with his Irish accent. “We plucked him out of a backwater in South Africa and saw him as a project,” Wilkins told RTÉ. “It was a bit of experimentation, trying him as that power winger on the right wing and he’s just thrived on it, getting his hands on the ball and a bit more space around him. “So, there’s more to come from him. I think there’s incredible explosiveness and just a real confidence about him when he’s got the ball in hand.” Given this week, prophetic words.

Title: 'New toys' are back on the menu at Apollo as it looks to M&A to grow

One of Marc Rowan's favorite refrains as CEO of Apollo has been "no new toys." So central has been this philosophy of focusing on execution instead of growing through M&A or new initiatives that it was the theme of the firm's 2023 holiday video. That time has now passed, Rowan suggested on the firm's 2024 year-end earnings call. Pointing to the firm's acquisition last month of Argo Infrastructure Partners, a $6 billion assets-under-management firm with a track record of infrastructure investments, Rowan said the firm plans to acquire companies that stand to help expand Apollo's lending capabilities. "You should expect us to continue to do modest M&A along the same lines where we are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate," Rowan said. Rowan's comments come amid a brightening picture for deals across the economy, stirred by the perception of a more business-friendly federal government and improving economic picture. At the end of last year, Apollo rolled out a five-year plan to double its private credit assets under management to $1.2 trillion. Rowan took care to say that the firm's dealmaking ambitions are "modest." He pointed to BlackRock's 2024 acquisitions in private credit and other alternative asset managers as an example of a broader convergence of public and private markets — a key Apollo theme. BlackRock plans to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners and private-market data platform Preqin for $12 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and has already purchased investors Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. Apollo's acquisitions, by contrast, will be "small-scale" said Rowan, saying they will help the firm create more products for large public asset managers, like BlackRock, to access the private markets. Apollo's private credit ambitions have so far been fueled by its insurance arm, Athene, with Apollo using Athene's balance sheet to fund its lending needs. When asked about the possibility that some large insurance assets may soon come up for sale, Rowan responded by saying the firm isn't going to just grow for growth's sake. "For us, growth is not just about growing the assets," Rowan said, adding that the firm already had to capital to lend a record $70 billion-plus last year. Instead, the firm wants to grow where it can lend, with Argo as a "prototype." "We are focused on expanding capabilities that can be immediately accretive buying something that in and of itself does not fit with our franchise," Rowan said. Apollo now has access to more than 20 individuals with experience investing in infrastructure, and those individuals now have much more capital to tap into and many more ways to invest. Jump to

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stands against the other low risk high growth stocks. In the past few days, the reintroduction of tariffs by the US government has been a significant factor influencing market dynamics. A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% levy on Chinese imports, has heightened concerns about potential trade wars. These measures have led to increased market volatility, as investors assess the implications for global supply chains and corporate earnings. According to a report by news agency Reuters, based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure to US equities, marking the fifth consecutive week of net selling. This trend indicates a defensive posture, with funds anticipating potential economic slowdowns resulting from the new tariffs. Conversely, retail investors have shown resilience, injecting significant capital into the market, possibly betting on a resolution to trade tensions.

Meanwhile, another report by Reuters, based on a survey carried out by investment bank Barclays, reveals that investors are shifting away from traditional hedge fund strategies that rely on broad market movements due to concerns over market volatility in 2025. The Barclays survey of 325 hedge fund investors managing nearly $9 trillion found they want hedge funds to reduce beta exposure to as low as 5% or even zero. The report highlights that traditional hedge fund approaches like long/short stock picking, credit, and activism are losing favor. Instead, investors prefer funds using algorithmic trading and merger-arbitrage strategies.

Bengaluru: Godrej Properties Ltd will look at profitable growth, expansion through land acquisitions, and build scale through higher market share, said a top company executive. The Mumbai-based developer has achieved 71% of its 2024-25 sales guidance of ₹27,000 crore on the back of strong housing demand and sales. In FY24, the company clocked ₹22,500 crore of sales bookings, making it the highest selling developer. “We will meet the sales guidance in the fourth quarter, which is said to be the strongest quarter in real estate. We have a number of launches coming up in multiple cities including Hyderabad, Noida, Pune, Gurugram. There are also two luxury projects in Mumbai which will be launched,” Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairperson, Godrej Properties, said in an interview. On Tuesday, the company reported a 152.23% rise in net profit to ₹158.20 crore for the October-December quarter, compared to ₹62.72 crore a year earlier. Revenue jumped 193.2% to ₹968.88 crore during the same period. “We are the largest residential developer in the country today, but we have a modest single-digit market share in the property markets we operate in. In FY24, we just about touched 10% market share in NCR, which is possibly our largest market. So, there is huge room for growth for Godrej Properties,” Godrej said. The three-month period through December was the sixth consecutive quarter when Godrej Properties clocked over ₹5,000 crore in sales bookings, the company said, underlying the sectoral tailwinds for India's residential real estate sector. In FY25 so far, the company has added projects of future sales value of over ₹23,000 crore, surprassing its ₹20,000 crore annual guidance. In December, Godrej Properties raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC, Blackrock, and SBI Pension, through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. "This capital allows us to further increase the pace of growth. We need to continue executing well, keep acquiring land and launching projects, and have a stronger presence across the cities we are present in, to gain market share," Godrej said. Around 80-90% of its group housing projects will be focused on the key cities it operates in, which includes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-National Capital Region, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Godrej Properties will opportunistically look at markets such as Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For plotted development projects, “we are happy to go to the top 20 or more cities”, Godrej said. After clocking around ₹73,000 crore of residential sales bookings in FY24, a milestone for India’s real estate sector, the top four publicly listed developers—Godrej Properties, DLF Ltd, Macrotech Developers Ltd and Prestige Group--are collectively targeting nearly ₹88,000 crore of sales in FY25.

Dunnes Stores boss Margaret Heffernan, has been removed as a defendant and replaced with a company name in High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims building work has interfered with his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. He has claimed Ms Heffernan and others interfered with his property rights including by the building of a car park for Dunnes. The alleged interference began, he says, when scaffolding was allegedly unlawfully erected around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th-July 21st, 2022. [ Dunnes Stores chief executive seeks strike-out of man’s claims of property interferenceOpens in new window ] He also claims a scaffolding firm unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of gardaí and that work on demolishing his former home was carried out without appropriate permission from the council. On Tuesday Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed Ms Heffernan’s name could be removed as a defendant in the case and substituted with Dunnes Stores Better Value Unlimited Company. He also agreed five named gardaí from Blackrock and Dundrum stations could be replaced as defendants by the Garda Commissioner. He claims the gardaí wrongfully assisted in evicting him from what was his home. Last month, Mr O’Shaughnessy was granted interim High Court orders preventing Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding; Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; the five gardaí; and Ms Heffernan from interfering with his property. All defendants deny his claims. He had applied to Mr Justice Brian Cregan for the orders on an ex-parte basis, which meant only he was in court on that day. Mr O’Shaughnessy, who is representing himself before the court, returned before Mr Justice Cregan on Tuesday when he said he was “trying to get at the truth” in bringing proceedings. He said his home had been “bulldozed to a shell” and that Mr Corcoran, who is a scaffolder, was claiming ownership without any proof. Lawyers for Mr Curran, the gardaí and Ms Heffernan said Mr O’Shaughnessy had brought proceedings against the incorrect defendants and they were seeking that they be amended. Ms Heffernan’s counsel, Martin Hayden SC, said his client also wanted the entire case struck out against his client as the pleadings showed no cause of action. He also said his client had “no involvement, good, bad or indifferent with the property”. As well as agreeing to the change of name for Ms Heffernan and the gardaí, Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed that Mr Curran’s name as a defendant could be replaced with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Co Council. The judge gave directions for exchange of affidavits between the defendants and Mr O’Shaughnessy and said the case could come back in March.

Title: How Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) Drive Up the Cost of Health Care
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pharmacy-benefit-managers-drive-up-cost-healthcare/5878884
Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:42:01Z

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) evolved from simple claims processors into powerful health care intermediaries that control drug pricing and access through their relationships with insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs engage in “spread pricing” — charging insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies and pocketing the difference — while also steering patients toward higher-cost medications through “rebate pumping” arrangements with drug manufacturers The current health care system, influenced by PBMs, underemphasizes preventive care while promoting long-term drug dependency, as ongoing prescription management generates more reliable revenue than prevention or cures Independent pharmacies and rural hospitals struggle financially under PBM practices, facing delayed reimbursements, strict audit requirements, and complex negotiation terms that often force them to either close or sell to larger chains Three major investment firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”) — have significant financial stakes across PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance companies, creating a web of interconnected financial interests Solutions include eliminating safe harbor rebate rules, expanding cash-pay health care models, separating PBM services from insurance companies, and implementing stricter regulations to improve pricing transparency * In the featured video, independent journalist Tucker Carlson interviews Brigham Buhler — founder and CEO of Ways2Well, a preventative care and health optimization platform — about how the health insurance industry works to keep us in poor health. Buhler’s career in health care spans over 25 years, during which he gained significant insights into the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The rising cost of health care in the United States has become a heavy burden for many families who struggle to pay for essential services. Patients often end up navigating a maze of insurance requirements, denials, and opaque billing practices without understanding why their treatments cost so much. Pharmaceutical prices add another layer of difficulty, with insurers and other entities setting guidelines that determine access. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, occupy a powerful place in this ecosystem. Initially created to simplify payments and negotiate prices, they have grown into influential brokers controlling which drugs are covered and how they are priced. Critics argue that these corporations operate behind the scenes, orchestrating deals that maximize their profits while pushing more expenses onto patients. In other words, PBMs engage in hidden collaborations and pricing manipulations that fuel a system that is more concerned with corporate gain than with patient well-being. By shedding light on the complex financial incentives at play, Buhler helps us understand why each step of seeking medical care — from preventive screenings to essential prescriptions — feels increasingly draining on both wallets and morale. He reveals an elaborate structure where individuals are funneled into long-term drug usage while basic preventative care is overlooked. Instead of ensuring affordability, PBMs exploit hidden markups and secret rebates to inflate insurance bills and keep people locked in chronic illness. For decades, researchers have warned that chronic disease often begins with lifestyle factors. A diet loaded with chemicals, refined sugars, and addictive formulas paves the way for obesity, metabolic issues, and diabetes. The logical solution would be preventive care, yet the system consistently underfunds or blocks such efforts. Instead, the patient, already in poor health, is nudged into a cycle of drugs. In short, insurance companies profit from setting premiums and reimbursements that don’t address the root causes. PBMs connect drug manufacturers with insurance plans and pharmacies. By deciding which medications get favorable placement on insurance formularies, they have substantial power to shape treatment pathways. They operate as the “middlemen,” determining reimbursement rates and adding costs that might not be obvious to consumers. Critics argue that each link in this chain — from the chemistry of our fast-food culture to the mechanics of corporate insurance contracts — feeds long-term drug dependency. People hope doctors will rescue them with thoughtful interventions, yet many find themselves steered into prescriptions rather than genuine solutions. The net effect is a growing population locked into care that does little to uproot their actual problems. Pharmacy Benefit Managers began as logistical helpers for insurance claims, intended to ease administrative burdens and secure group discounts on medications. In those early days, patients often benefited from lower prices and streamlined services, confident that PBMs were working on their behalf to rein in drug spending. Over time, PBMs took a more pivotal role by merging with major insurers, pharmacies, and even drug companies. This expansion gave them the power to decide which medications appear on covered lists and how high co-pays would be set. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, often called the “Big Three,” poured investments into many PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance firms, linking them financially. Regulatory agencies did little to keep up. Safe harbor laws, originally designed to allow certain discount arrangements, opened a door to hidden deals that few outsiders could track. Even government officials sometimes admit that they lack the tools or data to parse how PBMs arrive at final medication costs or distributions. This vacuum fosters multiple avenues for manipulative pricing. While PBMs publicly champion themselves as experts in cost reduction, many inside observers contend that the real focus is leveraging secret rebates and inflated prices. The result is an enigma for consumers and health providers, who see rising expenses but cannot pinpoint exactly where the money goes. Without greater transparency, the underlying profit mechanisms of PBMs remain locked away behind bureaucratic layers. A key accusation involves “spread” pricing, where PBMs charge insurers a higher rate than they reimburse pharmacies, quietly pocketing the difference. Though advertised as normal operations, this method can inflate costs at every transaction. One high-profile investigation in Ohio’s Medicaid system revealed how drastically these discrepancies boosted PBM revenues, convincing state officials that alternative approaches were more cost-effective. A second alleged tactic is “rebate pumping.” PBMs decide which drugs get priority coverage, sometimes favoring those with generous rebates from manufacturers. While patients believe they are following insurance rules, they might be guided toward medications that offer bigger profits for the PBM, even if more affordable or clinically superior options exist. This hidden arrangement undermines genuine market competition. Formulary manipulation can steer entire populations toward high-cost drugs. When PBMs place lower-cost medications in less accessible tiers or require complicated approvals, patients rarely realize they’ve been nudged into pricier choices. Over time, these directed behaviors funnel billions into the PBM’s revenue stream. Smaller drug makers, unable to provide large rebates, struggle to compete. There is also the “deny, delay, depose” approach: denying coverage, delaying approvals, and deposing providers to wear down patients who challenge any claim refusal. The bureaucracy can be exhausting, compelling many people to simply accept PBM-dictated medications or give up on certain procedures. On top of this, forced mail-order mandates reduce local pharmacy competition. Large PBMs often own chain pharmacies or mail services, ensuring yet another revenue channel. By dictating that some prescriptions must be filled through a mail-order affiliate, they tighten their hold on supply routes. Collectively, all of these maneuvers burden the sick while generating steady corporate windfalls. Small, independent pharmacies are the first to feel the weight of these arrangements. They operate on narrow margins, often waiting extended periods for reimbursement. Regular audits can penalize them if co-pays or deductibles aren’t strictly collected. Many find the financial strain overwhelming and convert to cash-only practices or sell to bigger chains aligned with PBMs. Hospitals, especially those in rural or underserved areas, also struggle. Heavy dependence on insurer contracts means they must accept the terms PBMs set, even if that means late or partial payments. The complexity of negotiations can leave hospitals uncertain of actual reimbursement amounts for surgeries and treatments. Over time, these uncertainties hamper hiring efforts, infrastructure updates, and overall quality of care. Patients shoulder the brunt of it. Co-pays and deductibles, often determined by PBMs in tandem with insurance companies, can skyrocket. A single major procedure might leave someone battling endless paperwork, fighting denials, or searching for a distant “in-network” specialist. Over time, chronic disease management grows more expensive, sometimes to the point where even standard treatments become a risky financial gamble. Though high costs might be justified as byproducts of progress, critics point out that patients who need life-extending therapies can be denied based on invisible profit motivations. These denials or lengthy pre-authorization demands can dangerously delay critical interventions. Overall, the system keeps many people in a perpetual state of fear, worried about the next surprise bill or approval hurdle. The troubling notion is that PBMs profit when people remain in long-term treatment. Managing diabetes, heart disease, or recurring infections, for example, yields continual revenue from drug sales, hospital stays, and follow-up visits. If earlier screenings or lifestyle guidance could prevent these conditions, insurers and PBMs would lose a recurring income stream. Thus, the system subtly discourages prevention. Preventive care often gets labeled as “non-essential.” Insurance companies may only cover minimal checkups or simplified blood panels rather than the deep investigative screenings that might detect cancer cells or metabolic shifts. Doctors who push for thorough evaluations can face audits or claim denials. This approach effectively steers clinicians away from digging into root causes and keeps them dispensing short-term fixes instead. Chemotherapy, obesity medications, and specialized therapies offer further insight. PBMs choose which oncology drugs or weight-loss injections land on the top tier of coverage, frequently guided by favorable rebate structures. For instance, prescribing an expensive cancer drug is more attractive to PBMs than promoting cost-effective solutions or advanced screenings. By focusing on maximum reimbursement rather than clinical optimization, PBMs foster a system that prizes medication adherence over true health. Even potential cures or preventative interventions fade in importance compared to the reliable flow of payments from chronic prescriptions. One of the biggest shields for PBMs lies in corporate media’s dependence on pharmaceutical advertising. Huge budgets flow from big pharma and PBMs into television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms. Investigative reporters who try to expose PBM tactics might find their stories curtailed. Advertisers dislike unfavorable coverage and influence editorial choices that help them maintain their revenue streams. Lobbying piles on another layer of insulation. PBMs, insurers, and drug manufacturers invest massively in shaping legislation. They aim to preserve safe harbor laws and defend the complexity of rebate arrangements. Officials, short on time and expertise, often accept industry talking points that claim PBMs deliver broad discounts. Meanwhile, advanced data remain hidden under confidentiality clauses, preventing thorough oversight. Alternative or cost-effective providers become immediate targets for negative coverage or red tape. Compounding pharmacies, which customize medications more cheaply, face extra scrutiny and high-profile condemnation if any recall occurs. At the same time, preventive clinics that promote advanced blood tests and deeper lifestyle assessments are dismissed as “non-traditional,” leading many patients to doubt their credibility. Without a major shift in how media and lobbying are handled, PBMs will likely continue operating in the shadows, benefiting from the current structure. Even well-intentioned legislators who propose reforms may confront a lobbying wall that distorts or dilutes their efforts. As long as the press echoes PBM-friendly narratives, the public remains unaware of the mechanics that inflate drug costs and stifle real medical innovation. Some argue that the fastest route to PBM accountability is legislative reform. Eliminating safe harbor rebate rules could force full disclosure of every cent collected from manufacturers. If the public saw how big the discrepancy was between list prices and actual reimbursements, the outcry might pressure policymakers to demand fairer pricing structures. Others propose expanding the cash-pay model so that pharmacies and clinics can sidestep PBM-dictated reimbursements. Direct primary care clinics, which ask for a monthly membership rather than rely on insurance, show promise. Patients pay transparent fees, sidestepping the labyrinth of co-pays, claim denials, and lengthy authorization steps. Critics say it may limit coverage for catastrophic events, but supporters argue it fosters clearer, more compassionate medical relationships. Another idea is to separate PBM services from insurance altogether. Insurers could be barred from owning or partnering with PBMs, avoiding the vertical integration that squeezes out independent competitors. If drug costs were set in an open marketplace, free from hidden rebates, local pharmacies might compete on actual prices, improving affordability for the average consumer. Finally, bold political will is essential. Some leaders talk about dismantling PBMs, a move that could reorder the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. Opponents decry it as radical, but the current system is unsustainable. If enough people demand an end to covert backroom deals, PBMs could be dethroned from their gatekeeping position, placing health care decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. The PBM conversation intersects with a larger reality: a culture of processed foods and tobacco-inspired marketing that has ravaged public health. By engineering addictive flavors and packaging, corporations profit from driving individuals toward chronic ailments like diabetes. PBMs then profit further from long-term prescription management. This chain of enticements traps many in endless cycles of medication. Preventive medicine would disrupt this pattern, but PBMs have little reason to champion comprehensive screenings. If fewer people develop metabolic disease, the volume of prescription-based revenue drops, undermining the financial base of PBM operations. In short, more robust screenings, especially for heart disease and early-stage cancer, would save lives but erode corporate balance sheets. The good news is that many patients are now starting to rebel and opt for things like direct-pay blood tests, customized diets, and health care providers who embrace functional principles — all of which weaken the PBM chokehold. By proactively caring for your body, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a chronic customer for expensive prescriptions. The goal, in essence, is to break the cycle that pairs hidden market incentives with manufactured disease. PBMs exert a profound influence on who gets what medication and at what cost, yet much of their work is veiled from public view. As explained by Buhler, this system, anchored in concealed rebates, inflated average wholesale prices, and manipulative formulary structures, is responsible for skyrocketing health care costs. Patients feel the sting through insurance premiums, high deductibles, and arbitrary claim denials. By peeling back the layers, we see a troubling alliance between PBMs, major insurers, and media outlets — a web that thrives on keeping Americans in long-term prescription cycles. Though reforms have been proposed, progress is stalled by extensive lobbying and carefully crafted narratives that depict PBMs as cost-saving heroes. Still, a rising movement demands real transparency and policy changes that might reset the playing field. Shifting the balance of power involves both political and individual actions. For example, we need to urge lawmakers to abolish secret rebate loopholes and consider stricter regulation of PBMs. On a personal level, you can also explore direct-pay health care models, improve your knowledge about preventive medicine, and support local pharmacies that sidestep the PBM structure. As noted in the featured interview, a failure to confront these issues leaves us with ever-increasing premiums, minimal improvements in chronic disease outcomes — and minimal trust in the institutions supposed to protect public health. But if genuine policy efforts and grassroots initiatives merge, we can begin to reclaim control. The prospects for cheaper drugs, renewed primary care, and a greater focus on prevention could then become more than just a distant hope. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Price On The Brink: Failure To Hold This Level May Trigger Crash To $74,000

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing renewed selling pressure as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China lead to fresh tariffs on both sides. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $91,000 on Monday, while major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also faced losses. The most recent installment of tariffs comes after the US enacted a 10% tax on all items from China, leading China to respond with its own tariffs on certain US imports, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. In another development, China has launched an inquiry into Google LLC over supposed antitrust infringements, intensifying the tension between the two economic giants. This market turbulence has wiped out the benefits from a short relief rally on Monday, which occurred after the Trump administration decided to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month. The weekend’s initial declaration of US tariffs had already triggered a steep drop in cryptocurrency prices. Investor trust in riskier assets has been notably affected, as US investors pulled a net $235 million from a set of 12 Bitcoin-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Inc.’s derivatives market decreased by 4%, reflecting a more cautious attitude among institutional investors. President Donald Trump, recognized for his pro-crypto position, has unintentionally brought more uncertainty to digital asset markets. Although cryptocurrencies experienced a rise following Trump’s election, the market now faces a difficult landscape marked by geopolitical strife and regulatory obstacles. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,970, about 13% shy of its all-time high. Meanwhile, US ETFs investing in Ethereum witnessed record trading volumes on Monday, with significant liquidation of leveraged positions rattled by ongoing trade uncertainties. The iShares Ethereum Trust, led by BlackRock, accounted for nearly half of the $1.5 billion in trading volume among a group of nine ETFs. ETH plummeted by as much as 27% on Monday, leading to over $600 million in liquidations within perpetual futures markets, according to Bloomberg data. Analyzing current price trends, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,180 as a critical support level for Bitcoin, based on MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) pricing bands. If this support level fails, the next target could be $74,400. Despite the recent price correction, Bitcoin traders are still enjoying a profit margin of 3.36%. Historically, local bottoms have formed when profit margins drop below -12%, suggesting that Bitcoin could have further downside potential before reaching a true bottom. Additionally, the MVRV Momentum indicator has remained in negative territory since the beginning of the year, signaling ongoing market weakness.
