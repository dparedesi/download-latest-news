Why is June the next key deadline to watch for a potential catalyst for ETH? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed decisions on staking and in-kind redemption for Ethereum [ETH] ETFs (exchange-traded funds). The agency sought more time on the staking application on two Grayscale spot ETH ETFs. As a result, the deadline has been extended to the 1st of June. The issuer made the application in February. Others like Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton had applied for similar staking provisions for their respective ETH ETF products. As of this writing, only BlackRock has not applied for the same. But Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, had publicly acknowledged the benefit of staking for the products. The regulator also delayed decisions on in-kind creation and redemption for ETH ETFs and BTC ETFs. In-kind redemption, unlike current cash settlements demanded by Gary Gensler-led SEC, ensures the use of underlying assets like ETH or BTC. The in-kind method avoids taxable events and enhances liquidity. The regulator pushed the in-kind decision deadline to 3rd June. That said, the SEC’s crypto task force has held roundtable discussions with key players, including Jito, MultiCoin Capital, and BlackRock, about crypto ETF staking and in-kind redemption. Source: Coinglass Meanwhile, the update didn’t spur any change in ETH’s speculative interest. According to Coinglass data, Open Interest (OI) has been on a decline since February, dropping from nearly $26B to below $20 billion. This meant that the bearish sentiment persisted even after the update. On the 4-hour price chart, ETH chalked a bearish rising wedge, which could drag it below $1500 again if the pattern is validated. However, reclaiming $1.8K could allow bulls to advance further.

Title: Quelle Surprise: Three Days After Milei Signs Another Unpayable IMF Bailout, US Treasury Secretary Pays Argentina a Call

The US has one clear goal in sight: to get Argentina to sever its ties with China, particularly by terminating a long-standing currency swap agreement. As we warned just over a month ago, the wheels are beginning to fall off the Mileis’ faux libertarian clown bus. But if anything, the freakshow is getting weirder. Last Friday (11/04), as the country experienced its third general strike since Javier Milei’s government took office 16 months ago, Milei gave a televised address to the nation. Flanked by his senior cabinet members, Milei told the Argentine people that his government had finally lifted the currency controls that had plagued the economy since 2011 so that people can once again buy dollars unhindered. Economic stability, he said, had finally returned to the country — all thanks to another, ahem, IMF bailout, Argentina’s 23rd since becoming a member of the fund in 1956. Fake Libertarians Celebrate While IMF Staffers Refuse to Sign Off To my knowledge, this is the first time that an Argentinean government, or indeed any national government, has responded to an IMF bailout with jubilant celebrations. Normally, an IMF bailout is the last resort for a government that has run out of options, not the beginning of a new golden age, as the Milei government is trying to present it. The fact that the Milei government in is filled with pseudo-libertarians to whom the IMF should be anathema makes it all the more surreal. Argentina’s Finance Minister Luis Caputo, a serial debtor and former JP Morgan Chase banker who already burdened Argentina with a $57 billion IMF loan in 2018, even thanked his wife and children for their support during the negotiations, as if he were winning a lifetime award. At the same time, some senior IMF staffers were so opposed to the deal that they were willing to walk away from their jobs, according to La Política Online (LPO): The opposition that this situation generated among the staff of the organisation, led to the firing of several management cadres. First it was the Chilean Rodrigo Valdés, who as director of the Western Hemisphere was the persion who naturally had to lead the Argentine case. Valdés is a consistent critic of Argentina’s hyper-indebtedness favoured by the Fund. And now it has emerged that Turkey’s Ceyla Pazarbasiogluel, the director of the IMF’s Strategy, Policy and Review Department (SPR), refused to sign off on the new loan. In her place, two minor officials intervened to trigger the loan. “Totally outside the manual,” the Fund itself acknowledged to LPO. The SPR is known as the “alpha male” of the IMF’s departments, or the IMF’s “politburo” — metaphors that illustrate its enormous power behind the scenes, since no major report can be published without its approval, as a former member of that committee revealed in an article in the Financial Times. The IMF’s original $57 billion bailout of Argentina in 2018 was already the biggest in the Fund’s 81-year history. At the time, many warned that Argentina would end up bailing on the bailout. As my former WOLF STREET colleague Wolf Richter wrote at the time, “No one should ever lend dollars to Argentina, not even the IMF. This always ends the same way: in a default.” And so it proved. In recent weeks, a default was looking more and more likely. The Central Bank of the Argentina Republic (BCRA) had burnt through more than $40 billion of the country’s foreign exchange reserves in a futile attempt to keep the peso artificially high, and thus inflation (in pesos) artificially low. In the process, it had not only run out of reserves, it had taken them into negative territory, and was now auctioning off other state assets to contain the run on the dollar. Now, even senior staffers at the IMF are warning about the risks of doubling down on the Fund’s exposure to Argentina’s debt. Buried within the text of the new agreement is an admission by the Fund itself that Argentina’s even more bloated debt load is practically unpayable. From LPO: What is striking is that even without Pazarbasiogluel’s signature on the contract, the SPR warns in the fine print of the agreement about the risk of the IMF’s larger than ever exposure to Argentina. The Fund’s maximum credit to Argentina, assuming disbursements are made as scheduled, is projected to reach 1,352% of the country’s quota in 2026. This would be the Fund’s largest exposure in absolute terms in its history. Argentina is receiving loans not just from the IMF but also the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank, all of which will have their own sets of terms and conditions. The IMF will be providing just under half of the total $42 billion bailout ($20 billion) while the World Bank will chips in an extra $12 billion, and the IAB, $10 billion. The latest loan package increases Argentina’s total debt to multilateral institutions to over $80 billion. Needless to say, attached to the IMF bailout are all the usual structural adjustment reforms (pensions reform, labour reform, fast-tracked privatisations, tax reforms and currency devaluation…) that the IMF itself admitted almost a decade ago don’t work yet continues to apply. Javier Milei, who before entering politics described the IMF as as a “perverse institution”, will happily abide. Loosening Currency Controls “Today we are breaking the cycle of disillusionment and disenchantment and are beginning to move forward for the first time,” Milei said. “We have eliminated the exchange rate controls on the Argentine economy for good.” Even in the most generous of readings, this is only partially true. Some currency controls not only remain in place but appear to have got even tighter. A statement issued by the central bank on Friday suggested that the loosening of currency controls will not apply to those who use cash. In order to be able purchase foreign currency banknotes, the central bank said that “customers’ use of local currency cash must not exceed the equivalent of USD 100 (one hundred US dollars) in the calendar month for all entities and for all the indicated purposes.” In other words, the currency exchange controls not only remain in place but will actually intensify for anyone using cash — before the latest IMF bailout, Argentineans could exchange up to 200 dollars worth of pesos in cash per month. Needless to say, $100 does not get you far in today’s Argentina, which thanks to Milei’s policies has became the most expensive country in dollar terms in Latin America. Government representatives have since countered that citizens and businesses will be able to buy unlimited sums of dollars and send them overseas — but only using online banking. This is great news, of course, for well-heeled corporations and investors, including those who have made huge returns by betting on the roughly 30 percentage-point interest rate differential between Argentina and the US — all made possible by the Milei government’s unsustainable policy to keep the peso artificially high against the dollar. Just as happened in 2018, it looks like an IMF loan is about to be used to finance capital flight out of the country. In 2018, the then-Macri government’s prior lifting of capital controls allowed the financial speculators who had invested in Argentine bonds to get their money out of the country before the next default. It’s a different story for the legions of Argentineans who don’t use online banking, preferring instead to have their savings, mainly in dollars, outside the banking system. This is largely because of their well-earned distrust of the banking system. It was, after all, only a generation ago that President Fernando De la Rúa imposed brutal restrictions on the withdrawal of money from banks, which would come to be known as “el corralito”. As inflation surged following repeated devaluations, many Argentines lost their life savings. Today, more and more people who do have bank accounts are having their bank accounts frozen due to failure to pay all their taxes on time or comply with the ever more onerous tax obligations. As we’ve reported previously, Milei’s government, despite its libertarian pretensions, has massively increased the tax burden during its 16 months in office, especially for lower and middle classes. Another way Argentineans will be instantly impacted by the bailout deal is through devaluation of the Argentine peso, and the resulting inflation it will fuel. One of the conditions of the IMF bailout is that the Milei government and central bank allow the Argentine peso to trade within a so-called currency band ranging from 1,000 to 1,400 pesos per dollar. On its first day of trading within the band, the official exchange rate fell 12%. It will probably fall a lot further. Just two months ago, Milei said there was no way his government would devalue the peso. De ninguna manera https://t.co/3pgcrSHZFB pic.twitter.com/xfESYCiF5W — Arrepentidos de Milei (@ArrepentidosLLA) April 14, 2025 The upshot of all this is that Argentina is likely to see a sharp resurgence in inflationary forces in the months to come. The Milei government’s most touted achievement — its supposed taming of inflation, achieved through the brutal application of austerity — was totally unsustainable. Inflation was already beginning to surge back in recent months. The country continues to boast the highest official inflation rate of any country not at war, and Milei is now talking about bringing price inflation to zero by mid-2026. Only his most committed followers will believe him. Meanwhile, the austerity will intensify. The only way the government has of bringing inflation under control is to kill the economy, and even that’s not working. US Secretary of State Pays a Call On Monday, just three days after the IMF mission left Argentina, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrived. It is unusual for a US treasury secretary to visit third countries, especially those with smallish economies, notes the Argentinean sociologist Atilio Boron in an essay on the possible reasons for Bessent’s visit. Besides participating in multilateral fora such as meetings of the G7, the G20, and the IMF, treasury secretaries rarely travel in an official capacity to countries that are not of decisive importance to the functioning of the global economy. Which is why the visit of Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Argentina yesterday (14/04) raised a few eyebrows, especially given the turbulent global economic and geopolitical backdrop. As trade officials in Washington awaited the arrival of Maros Sefcovic, the trade chief of the European Union, one of the US’ biggest trade partners with nearly $1 trillion in two-way trade last year, Bessent was sitting down to do business with Javier Milei, the president of a country that accounts for a mere $16.3 billion in total annual trade with the US. It’s not hard to see why. The obvious answer, says Boron, is China: In keeping with Trump’s full frontal attack against Beijing — once a mere economic competitor and now an apex enemy, as characterized by numerous official US documents – Bessent will surely repeat the three magic words of the White House, uttered by both Biden and Trump alike: “keep China out”. “A Very Interesting Partner” As readers may recall, Milei was initially hostile to the mere notion of doing business with the “murderous” regime in Beijing. But he gradually warmed to the idea as he realised how much Argentina’s economy and finances depended upon China, its second largest trade partner. By October last year, as dollars were drying up, Milei even began singing Beijing’s praises as efforts begun to relaunch Argentina’s strategic economic agreement with China. “China is a very interesting trading partner. They do not make demands, the only thing they ask is that they not be bothered.” In others words, general non-interference — the diametric opposite to how the US has traditionally engaged with its Latin American neighbours. Milei was also seemingly impressed by Chinese efficiency, saying: “We had a meeting with the ambassador (Wang Wei) in June, the next day they unlocked the swap,” referring to the rescheduling, last June, of the payments corresponding to an activated tranche of the currency swap that both nations are keen to maintain. But the US wants to gut that bilateral swap, and is apparently willing to use the IMF bailout as a bargaining chip. In a recent trip to Argentina, the US State Department’s head of Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone, cited the ending of Argentina’s swap line with China as a key condition for an explicit endorsement of the Trump administration for the IMP bailout. “We want to make sure that no agreement with the Monetary Fund ends up prolonging that line of credit or that swap they have with China,” said Claver-Carone. “If we do that, we are shooting ourselves in the foot.” Washington sees the swap line as an “extortion mechanism,” which is ironic given how Washington uses the IMF in exactly that way. In 2020, Claver-Carone, in the same role for the first Trump Administration as he has today, openly admitted that the US’s decision to grant the $57 billion loan requested by Mauricio Macri’s government in 2018 was largely based on geopolitical considerations. That loan was granted despite the fact that the funds were clearly going to be used for electoral purposes. From Infobae: Donald Trump considered Mauricio Macri a key player on the geopolitical chessboard of Latin America and used all his institutional power to support his Cambiemos government, which was in a bind due to recessionary conditions that could open the door to a Peronist victory in the approaching elections. Trump intended to block a return of the Justicialist Party to the Casa Rosada, since such a government would complicate his plans to end Nicolás Maduro’s regime in Venezuela. For the White House, a victory for Cristina Fernández… could bring back a populist axis — Argentina, Venezuela and Cuba — and affect US interests in the region. In this respect, the president of the United States not only supported Macri in public, but also secretly used all his global influence to get the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to break all its financial limits and grant Argentina a historic credit of more than 55,000 million dollars. In an interview with Bloomberg yesterday, Bessent praised Milei for working to bring down barriers towards reciprocal trade with the United States. He also admitted that the US is seeking to prevent Latin American countries from giving up their mining rights to China in return for aid. The unsaid part: those rights would be much better used in the hands of US, Canadian, European and Australian companies. “China has signed a number of these rapacious deals marked as aid, where … they’ve taken mineral rights. They’ve added huge amounts of debt onto these countries balance sheets,” he said. “They’re guaranteeing that future generations are going to be poor and without resources. And we don’t want that to happen any more than already has in Latin America.” This is all part of the collective West’s China debt trap lie that won’t die, as Conor documented in 2023: While Beijing certainly seeks influence in countries where it lends, it also usually builds infrastructure. And while those roads, train tracks, ports and more are also usually beneficial to Chinese operations, their construction also helps the host country. It’s also way more than the West offers in terms of infrastructure. There are, of course, other possible motives for Bessent’s presence. Perhaps, writes Boron, he visited Argentina to carry out an on-the-ground inspection of the possibility of dollarizing the Argentine economy, just at a time when the dollar is losing ground in the global economy: Dollarizing was one of Milei’s campaign pledges. Isn’t it possible that Trump, in great need of allies in this part of the world, has decided to bind Argentina to the US by taking advantage of the fact that its current government, imbued with a deep colonial mindset, would be more than happy to put an end to the peso – described by Milei as excrement — and replace it with the dollar? The USD already legally prevails as legal tender in Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Adding Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, to that list would be a formidable victory for Washington. And it could be done at negligible cost to the empire. A third possible motive flagged by Boron is that the US turns Argentina into a full-fledged military outpost. Given the country’s geostrategic position, on the doorsteps of the Antarctic and sharing the “Triple Frontier” with Brazil and Paraguay, a key border in South America in terms of population, movement of people and international relations, this is a distinct possibility: Is it outlandish to imagine that Bessent has come to demand, in exchange for the Argentine bailout, authorisation to install several US military bases in different parts of the country – especially in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego – in order to control access to Antarctica and the bioceanic passage in the event of a conflict in the Panama Canal zone, without having to negotiate anything with its devalued NATO partners stationed in the large British base built in our Malvinas (Falklands) Islands? The Milei government will, of course, happily oblige with any US demands. In an interview yesterday, Milei described Bessent’s visit as “historic” for Argentina, adding that his government is in “perfect synch” with Trump’s. Put simply, the Milei government will bend over backwards to give away Argentina’s riches. This was on full display in a speech given by Damián Reidel, the head of Milei’s Council of Advisors, at the Latam Forum in March. Speaking to captains of the US oil industry, tech company CEOs, billionaire investors and public officials, Reidel explained how the natural resources of southern Argentina would soon be theirs for the taking (emphasis my own): “We have large tracts of land with access to energy and water, cold climates, which is the icing on the cake for cooling AI systems; and in addition, we are in an area without armed conflicts, without tsunamis, or earthquakes. There aren’t many places on Earth with those qualities. Obviously, the problem is that these areas are populated by Argentines. So this is one of the things that we’ve fixed. We are stabilizing the macro, we are giving them the legal framework to explain to them that we are open for business this time.” Meanwhile, for Washington the IMF continues to serve as a handy tool for pursuing its geopolitical goals, not only in its own “backyard” but far beyond it. As more and more of the Global South’s stagnating and heavily indebted countries succumb to the whipsawing effects of Trump’s global trade war and enter into default, the use of that tool could be about to increase significantly. The question is: how will China respond? Beijing’s refusal to let a BlackRock-led consortium buy out a Hong Kong-based holding’s ownership of two ports on the Panama Canal has shown that it is willing to assert its power as Washington attempts to roll back its influence on the American continent. China is still an important contributor to the IMF’s coffers even as it has expanded its own loan agreements with Global South countries. But will that collaboration continue if Washington intensifies its weaponisation of the Fund against Beijing’s alliances with the Global South? There is one other participant in this unfolding drama that is getting much less attention: the Argentine people. As Boron notes, it would be a serious mistake to think that the current popular mood of relative passivity will last indefinitely: It is a fact that social mobilization has grown in recent months and that, as all the polls show, frustration is spreading even among those who voted for Milei (NC: the Mileis’ LIBRA crypto scam, targeted primarily at Milei’s most fervent supporters, was almost certainly a turning point in this regard)… A careful reading of this country’s past teaches us that the popular mood can change in the blink of an eye in the face of events that, in another historical context, would be unimportant. Thanks for this post, Nick. I can see that Milei is going to run Argentina into the ground and there does not seem to be a group in that country of stopping it. He’s like an even tackier version of Trump and corruption follows him wherever he goes. If the US forces Argentina to abandon links with China, what then? Will this be seen as an opportunity for the Trump regime to isolate that country and then to have a fire sale of assets in that country for Trump’s Wall Street buddies. Unfortunately I could see this happening very easily. After all these years of IMF involvement, I’m surprised there is anything left to sell. “and then to have a fire sale of assets in that country for Trump’s Wall Street buddies.” I wonder what assets Argentina has that can still be privatized? That seems to be the IMF’s ultimate goal. “BUENOS AIRES, Jan 8 (Reuters) – Argentina’s government has privatized metallurgical firm IMPSA, the economy ministry said on Wednesday, marking its first privatization since libertarian President Javier Milei took power just over a year ago promising to shrink the state. The company’s shares will be transferred to the U.S.-based consortium Industrial Acquisition Fund (IAF), whose top partner is Arc Energy, according to an official announcement on Wednesday.”‘ https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-privatizes-state-metal-firm-milei-era-first-2025-01-08/ yes, thanks nick for covering this beat… always lots of meaty info Ultimately accumulating more unpayable odious debts is just not going to make much of a difference. I expect a lot of global South debtor countries just to renounce their debts and nationalize productive assets, once the de-dollarization proceeds forward properly. That would be the thing for the USA to do. Until then, the global South debtor countries are going to need some security guarantees to pull such a thing off. IMO. Thank you. I’ll second “meaty”. Sometimes I read articles here and I do not understand a lot of the content (my shortcoming, not yours). This is one such article. However, even in my confusion about economic terms like “currency swaps” and why they matter, one thing shines through: at no point in this story does a hero emerge that is fighting for the interests of the Argentinian people. Everyone has an agenda to serve the ultra wealthy, public welfare be damned. Thank you for your reporting. Your email address will not be published.

Title: UK fintech Masrshmallow secures $90 million in debtt and equity funding at a valuation of $2 billion

Leading UK fintech, Marshmallow, today announces that it has raised $90 million worth of funding from Portage, BlackRock and Columbia Lake Partners. 0 15 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The raise comes three years after the business’ Series B, in which time, it has almost doubled its valuation to just over $2 billion. The investment, a mixture of equity and debt, from funds managed by BlackRock and CLP, will be used to further grow the business’ product offering and support plans for international expansion. The successful fundraise follows a period of impressive and sustained growth. Focused on providing car and van insurance to those who have moved to the UK, Marshmallow has now insured over 1 million drivers and has a turnover run rate of over $500m, making it one of the largest fintechs in Europe. People who move to the UK continue to unfairly face higher prices compared to those born in the country. Marshmallow has been focused on providing better value to these customers and will continue to leverage its proprietary technology and rich customer data to do so. Following this fundraise, the business will expand its proposition to support newcomers across a wider range of unmet financial needs, becoming the one-stop financial services provider for people moving to the UK. Marshmallow will also seek to expand its proposition internationally, with the business planning to offer financial products to people who have relocated to other countries, extending beyond serving just those who have moved to the UK. Oliver Kent-Braham, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Marshmallow, said: “Our ambition is to become a one-stop-financial-shop for newcomers so they feel as though it’s easy to move to, and live in, a different country. We’ve already supported over one million people in the UK with their insurance needs, but we’re only just scratching the surface. There are still major financial services barriers that make it harder for newcomers to settle and take part in everyday life. This funding gives us the capital to solve these problems and deliver against our mission.” Devon Kirk, General Partner & Co-Head, Portage Capital Solutions, commented: “Marshmallow is a clear leader in innovating to solve important financial challenges for consumers. We are confident in the business’ ability to continue developing solutions for a fairer financial ecosystem, and we are excited to support this strong team as it enters its next stage of growth.”

Now, with a million drivers insured and a profitable annual revenue run rate of $500 million, Marshmallow has raised a fresh $90 million to expand. Marshmallow plans to use the funding to move into financial services, as well as more insurance products that it hopes will appeal to a population of people that — despite the chilling effects of Brexit — is growing. “We think of migration as a huge opportunity,” CEO Oliver Kent-Braham said in an interview. He noted that in the U.K., there are more people coming out of the workforce than there are going in, with 1.2 million migrants recorded coming to the U.K. in 2024 alone. “We need migration to put more people into work, and we want to help people move and integrate into the U.K.” In Marshmallow’s view, that integration comes with being able to drive your own insured vehicle and soon, the startup hopes, buying home insurance and taking out loans. Marshmallow plans to launch its first lending product later this year, Kent-Braham said, en route to building a “one-stop shop” for everything financial and insurance that a new arrival to the U.K. might need to adjust to life. This round is roughly split 50-50 between equity and debt, according to Kent-Braham, and it is coming at a valuation of just over $2 billion. To put that into context, Marshmallow last raised funding at $1.25 billion in 2021. The startup has seen considerable growth on the business front in that time. In 2021, Marshmallow had insured just 100,000 people. Now, in cities like London, the one-million insured number is bolstered with a pink outdoor ad campaign that is hard to miss. Portage Capital is leading the round, with participation from BlackRock and Columbia Lake Partners. Previous backers of the company have included Passion Capital, Investec, and Scor. Marshmallow has raised around $220 million to date. Notably, the new round has been in the works since at least January, and Kent-Braham noted that one part of the equity was convertible debt raised in 2023. Marshmallow’s funding is coming at a complex moment for insurance startups in Europe. On one side, there is the grim story of WeFox. Backed by SoftBank, Omers, Salesforce, and dozens of others, WeFox’s valuation rose to as much $4.5 billion by 2023. Just two years later, after years of losses and complications in its distributed/broker-based business model, WeFox has fallen on hard times. The company has been selling off parts of its business and picking up lifeline financing to stay afloat. Yet there are also some brighter signs of insurtech startups building more sustainable businesses. And those that can demonstrate a strong technology story are getting attention from investors. Just last week, Ominimo — a new startup out of Poland — picked up a major strategic investor that invested $10 million at a valuation of over $200 million. It was Ominimo’s first time raising outside money after becoming profitable while bootstrapped. Like Marshmallow, the startup started off with car insurance and is rethinking actuarial formulas and using AI to make new inroads into risk prediction. While data science and AI are quickly becoming table stakes for insurance startups, there are other details about Marshmallow that set it apart from the pack — and even some of its bigger competitors (like the price-busting mega-retailer Tesco). The ideas of inclusivity and diversity that underpin how Marshmallow is approaching its target customer base run deep at the startup. Kent-Braham co-founded London-based Marshmallow with his identical twin, Alexander, and David Goaté. The twins really do look a lot alike. “You could actually be talking to Alexander right now!”, Oliver joked when we spoke for this story. More seriously, though, the startup is an underrepresented rarity in another way, too. It is one of what appears to be only two “unicorn” startups in the U.K. from a Black founder, the other being WorldRemit. The statistics are not hugely encouraging outside the U.K. either; one 2024 study found that across the U.K. and the U.S., only 3% of startups with valuations of over $1 billion have Black founders. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion programs are being dismantled in the U.S., it’s notable that Marshmallow’s investors see particular strength precisely because of its diverse leadership. “This is a very strong founding team,” Devon Kirk, GP and co-head of Portage Capital Solutions, said in an interview. “We think that financial services benefits from different perspectives and leaders coming up with innovative solutions to address those needs.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

Title: Applied Materials becomes largest shareholder of advanced packaging firm BESI

Business FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with a displayed Applied Materials logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Applied Materials has bought a 9 per cent stake in BE Semiconductor industries (BESI), the U.S.-based computer chip equipment supplier said on Monday. The transaction makes it the largest shareholder of the Dutch company making advanced semiconductors packaging tools, above Blackrock Institutional Trust, according to LSEG data. BESI's shares rose 9 per cent in early trade and could see their largest one-day rise in more than a year if the gains hold. It produces the world's most accurate hybrid bonding tool, a critical chip technology allowing two chips to be bonded directly on top of each other. "I think that this is an astute move by (Applied Materials) to foster closer collaboration between the two companies," Timm Schulze-Melander, analyst at Redburn Atlantic, said in an email. The purchase makes it clear Applied is not developing an alternative to BESI's hybrid bonding tech, he added. Unlike most semiconductor packaging steps, hybrid bonding occurs much closer to the chip's production line and work together with Applied Materials' tools. "I think shareholders will be extremely excited and will assume that Applied will eventually want to buy the entire company," Michael Roeg from Degroof Petercam said in an emailed comment. The world's second largest computer chip equipment maker said it did not intend to seek board representation at BESI. BESI said last November it remained committed to its independence, amid rumours involving a strategic deal with the company. Hybrid bonding is used on the world's most advanced chips, like AMD's X3D line, where the memory chip is bonded onto the processor at TSMC.

Title: Approved retirement funds: What is an ARF and how much will it cost me?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/04/15/approved-retirement-funds-what-is-an-arf-and-how-much-will-it-cost-me/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
It’s the pension drawdown product that more and more of us are opting for and, yet, getting a fix on how much this product is going to cost us can confuse. While shopping around can help with cutting costs when it comes to an approved retirement fund (ARF), you need to understand just what you have to pay for and how different options work, before you can make the best decision for you. An ARF is a Revenue-approved financial vehicle that allows you to keep your pension fund invested after you retire. This means that the capital can continue to grow (hopefully) – although there is a mandatory withdrawal each year of at least 4 per cent, rising to 5 per cent once you reach the age of 71. Mandatory at least in the sense that Revenue will assess you for income tax on the basis that you are withdrawing that amount so you might as well. One advantage of an ARF is that you can pass it on, tax free, in the event of your death to your spouse. “Most people now won’t have defined benefit pensions, it’s mostly defined contribution, so when it comes to drawdown, many people will be taking a lump sum and putting the balance into an ARF,” says John Tuohy, chief executive of Acuvest. “So, understanding and managing them are important for people.” The alternative for those retiring is an annuity, which provides for a guaranteed income for life. This has been less popular in recent years due to lower interest rates, which means your pension pot delivers a lower annual income. [ Annuities or ARFs: what’s the correct decision?Opens in new window ] These days, annuity rates have fallen back again to around 4.5 per cent (which means it pays out an annual income of €4,500 on every €100,000), so an ARF will be the choice for many. But how much is this investment product going to cost you? If you have been a member of an occupational pension, you probably haven’t had to worry too much about such things. But once you retire, you are going out on your own via an ARF. That will inevitably mean higher costs – and the higher the costs, the lower the return to you. After all, this fund will have to last your lifetime and, while investment performance may be uncertain, fees and charges are a definite. [ Half a million euro for a ‘moderate’ retirement? The lump sums you need to saveOpens in new window ] When you retire, the company managing your occupational pension provider will likely offer you an ARF. But this doesn’t mean you have to jump into it. Better to consider all your options before making such a big decision. “People shouldn’t shop for product until they decide what their investment strategy is,” says Tuohy. “What’s my strategy? Am I doing it myself? Am I getting advice? Have I got a plan?” So what do you need to know? “With an ARF, consumers need to understand there are three elements to it,” says Tuohy. First up is the qualified fund manager or product provider, which is typically a life insurance company – Aviva, New Ireland, Irish Life, Standard Life, Zurich Life or Royal London – or a company regulated under the EU’s MiFID directive. This is the ARF platform, and takes on the custody, payroll, tax-deduction functions etc of the ARF. The next element is the fund manager with whom your retirement savings will be invested, and this includes the likes of Vanguard, Blackrock etc. Finally, you have a financial broker or adviser, who advises and arranges on the set-up of an ARF, “and I’d like to think advisers provide ongoing advice in helping to manage the ARF”, adds Tuohy. All three of these have costs. But how much? When it comes to the ARF platform, you can expect to pay around 0.4 per cent of the fund every year for this service. Next up is your investment. As Tuohy notes, “most people in ARFs will invest in funds, cash or passive equity or bond funds”. These will typically cost from upwards of about 0.2 per cent a year in management charges – but it will depend on the complexity of such products. “If you pick more expensive funds, you should expect to pay more,” says Tuohy. On top of this there will be ongoing fund costs, which may be of the order of about 0.06 per cent. Then you have the financial adviser charges. Your adviser may charge a flat fee for setting up an ARF – figures of about €7,000 have been quoted – or they may earn commission from the fund manager. This can reduce your allocation to the ARF so watch out for this. “There should always be a minimum 100 per cent allocation,” says, Ken O’Gorman, a director of One Quote Financial Brokers, adding that a recent client was offered an ARF with a 99 per cent rate. If you do opt to pay a flat fee for set-up, remember that your adviser may also be earning commission on this transaction, so make sure this is added as a bonus allocation to your fund. There may also be a clawback if you move your ARF within a specified period. Your financial adviser will also charge an annual fee, of about 0.5 per cent – although this can be less or more – for offering an ongoing advice service. [ Choosing a financial adviser: The last thing you want to do is risk losing your savingsOpens in new window ] “In my view, many brokers may overcharge,” says, O’Gorman, who adds that charges should be dependent on the level of service on offer. “You need to get what you’re being charged for,” he says, adding: “Unfortunately you will find brokers selling products. They think that’s the solution”. O’Gorman charges between 0.2 per cent and 0.25 per cent a year for ongoing advice, depending on the size of the ARF. “It’s about constructing ARFs in a more nuanced way to protect the client,” he says, adding that buying an ARF should not be “a rush job”, and that a typical approach will see him construct a portfolio that blends different managers. All in then, your ARF can cost between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent or so a year. This is not insignificant; if your ARF is worth €100,000, it will cost you between €1,000 and €1,500 a year, increasing to between €5,000 and €7,500 for an ARF valued at €500,000. “Everything is negotiable, especially if the ARF is particularly large,” advises O’Gorman. The larger your ARF, the lower you can expect your potential charges to be – at least as a percentage, if not in value terms. For example, with Cantor Fitzgerald, you’ll pay 1.25 per cent a year on a portfolio that is smaller than €100,000 on an execution only basis, rising to 1.5 per cent for an advisory option. Portfolios in excess of €1 million have a fee of 0.5 per cent execution only, or 0.75 per cent with advice. Transactional charges may also reply. Once you understand the different elements of an ARF, you can then consider your options. If you just want a standard ARF, and are happy to take this out without ongoing financial advice, you could look for an execution-only standard product. [ Women, take control to ensure you have enough income in retirementOpens in new window ] Broker Gerard Sheehy of execution-only.ie, for example, offers low cost options with providers including Standard Life, Royal London and Zurich Life. With Standard Life for example, you’ll pay annual charges of 0.65 per cent, which includes broker commission. Additional charges apply related to the specific funds you choose, but there are low-cost options here too – if you pick the Vanguard Global Stock Index tracking fund, for example, that 0.65 per cent would increase to 0.67 per cent. Going through an adviser to buy your ARF from a life company – and getting the associated financial advice – will push the cost north of about 1 per cent. Such products offer a lot of choice “but you’re going to have to accept limitations” says Tuohy, in terms of investment opportunities and choices. If you want “a much fuller window on to the market”, you’ll be looking at a more sophisticated option, such as that offered through Conexim, a subsidiary of Irish Life. You can only get access to this through an adviser (so remember to add in the cost of this too), but for a fee of about 0.4 per cent, you’ll be able to access a much wider range of investment choices (it has more than 9,000 funds on its platform). And fees on these funds may be lower than those offered through the standard life company option. If neither of these options (ie a standard ARF with advice, or execution only) suits you, you can also consider managing your ARF yourself. A self-directed option allows you to access a much wider range of investment options, such as structured products, property, private equity and gold, as well as traditional equity funds. And it gives you greater control over your investment decisions. But should you opt for self-directed, you may find you have to pay more. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Reflections from Columbia’s Forum on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duty
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/04/14/reflections-from-columbias-forum-on-climate-related-fiduciary-duty/

As the physical and economic harms of climate change accumulate, corporate managers have faced increasing pressure to reduce their companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and adapt their businesses to climate-related risks. In parallel, civil society organizations and activist investors have increasingly sought to compel private sector action on climate change, while the “anti-ESG” political movement has sought to prevent financial managers from considering climate risks entirely. These discussions have frequently centered on one key element of corporate governance: fiduciary duties. Broadly, fiduciary duties arise when one person entrusts another with discretion over their financial affairs. For decades, legal scholars have recognized that fiduciary duties under corporate law may force private companies to address climate change. Writing in 2002, Professor Perry Wallace argued that both the physical threats of climate change and the legal and economic impacts of society’s response to those threats will inevitably implicate “the heart of corporate governance.” In recent years, as the impacts of climate change and the energy transition have become more apparent, boards and courts have faced a challenging question: what fiduciary duties do corporate directors and officers owe around climate change? On February 21, 2025, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and the Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership, in partnership with the European Corporate Governance Institute, hosted a colloquium exploring that question. This blog offers reflections on the Colloquium and highlights areas for future research and action around climate-related fiduciary duties. The New Climate Fiduciaries Colloquium, held at Columbia Law School, brought together approximately three hundred participants who explored whether, and how, corporate directors and officers are obligated to respond to climate change. The Colloquium intentionally gathered a diverse set of panelists and participants, and was not intended to produce consensus about the scope or direction of climate-related fiduciary duties. See here for the Colloquium agenda; video recordings of the keynote addresses and panels are available on the Sabin Center’s YouTube channel and linked below. The Colloquium revealed several key dynamics that will shape the development of climate-related fiduciary duties. This section discusses three core takeaways from the Colloquium, which reflect the interpretation of the authors, and may not align with the opinions of every panelist or attendee. The Colloquium highlighted a core problem: a significant portion of corporate law commentary suffers from a lack of exposure to climate science and policy. Corporate scholars addressing climate change frequently understate or ignore the imminence and economic significance of climate change. While the Colloquium’s panelists and the attendees offered a sophisticated grasp of climate change, some influential corporate scholars like Professor Stephen Bainbridge frame climate change as an issue of social responsibility rather than an economic threat. Scholars like Bainbridge argue that climate change should trigger no fiduciary obligations because the duty of corporate directors and officers is to understand and oversee “the corporation’s business,” not to conform to “emerging social norms.” And while other recent scholarship finds that fiduciary duties extend to “mission-critical” risks to corporations, including “ESG” risks, this work assesses climate change as a reputational and liability concern for major emitters, and does not focus on the material supply chain and market disruptions that many corporations face due to climate change. And as several Colloquium panelists highlighted, courts are often ill-informed about the economic risk that companies face from the changing climate. Even academics with a sophisticated understanding of climate risks sometimes shorthand the terminology that distinguishes between corporate climate mitigation (the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions), and corporate climate adaptation (the process of responding to the changing physical, legal, and economic landscape caused by climate change). This imprecision can undercut promising lines of debate. For example, during panel discussions focused on climate mitigation, the debate revolved around whether fiduciary law implied any broad duty to for fiduciaries to monitor the impact of corporate activities on the wider world. However, several panelists also raised when, and whether, corporate fiduciaries could owe a duty to preserve the long-term value of firm or portfolio investments through climate adaptation, even if that adaptation is not immediately rewarded by the capital markets. Because the distinction between mitigation and adaptation was rarely clarified, several attempts to discuss fiduciary duties related to long-term corporate climate adaptation fell flat. This ambiguity in conversations among highly informed experts is likely mirrored and magnified in boardroom discussions. “Fiduciary duty” describes a category of legal obligation, but fiduciary duties arise in different, and legally distinct, contexts. Board members owe their corporations different obligations than asset managers owe their clients, for example. The different silos of fiduciary duty law are easily confused in judicial decisions and broader commentary. For example, in the weeks leading up to the Colloquium, a Texas District Court ruled in Spence v. American Airlines, that American Airlines, Inc. had breached its fiduciary duty to its pension beneficiaries under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by allowing its investment manager, BlackRock, to consider certain ESG issues. While this decision has not been affirmed by any higher court, and is one among many “anti-ESG” cases that have been heavily criticized by corporate and antitrust scholars, several panelists and participants in the Colloquium noted that it has already impacted their discussions with corporate directors and officers. This should be somewhat surprising, as the fiduciary duties owed by pension fund managers under the federal statute ERISA are similar to, but distinct from, the similarly-named duties owed by corporate directors and officers that arise from state statutes and common law. Setting aside the merits of the decision, there is no reason to think that the ERISA-focused ruling in Spence should directly affect the decisions of judges assessing fiduciary duties that arise under other legal schemes. But the distinctions are muddled, boards and officers may respond by being overly cautious, or by adhering to the wrong set of obligations. Discussions at the Colloquium highlighted that there is important legal analysis to be done clarifying the different sources of obligations for fiduciaries. Debates at the Colloquium also suggest that corporate climate action will continue to be shaped by litigation. Panelists discussed emerging litigation theories that seek to force corporations to respond to climate change, or to protect the discretion of directors and officers to independently assess climate risks. There was also concern about the potential for anti-climate litigation to preclude corporations from acting on climate risks. Experts debated whether competing standards would create a “Brussels effect” around climate corporate fiduciary duties, if multi-jurisdictional companies are pressured into a “race to the top” to operate in jurisdictions with high regulatory standards. In response to rising international standards and the increasing legal salience of climate change, plaintiffs may seek to bring fiduciary duty claims against directors and officers who fail to oversee corporate compliance with climate change laws in other jurisdictions. Corporations also face legal action from anti-ESG politicians and fossil fuel interests seeking to prevent corporate compliance with climate change-related laws in other jurisdictions. For example, Texas House Bill 4049, introduced on April 9, 2025, purports to ban companies doing business in Texas from complying with greenhouse gas reporting laws in other jurisdictions. This bill has not passed, and its legality and practical impact are highly suspect. But it reflects a troubling trend opposing corporate responses to climate change. Some panelists observed that this anti-environmental activism may, somewhat ironically, prompt fiduciary litigation from climate advocates defending corporations, in an effort to establish that fiduciary duty law gives directors and officers the right to consider climate risks, even if it does not necessarily mandate that they do so. The 2025 Colloquium on Climate-Related Fiduciary Duties suggests several new avenues to advance private sector responses to climate change. As discussed above, corporate law scholars and climate change experts sometimes lack a shared expertise and terminology. A body of neutral, educational research and “primer” resources would be valuable to reduce confusion about the legal status of climate-related fiduciary duties. This material could educate researchers, practitioners, commentators, and the public about the different silos of fiduciary duty law, with analysis of the climate-related rules and caselaw applicable to each. This would both inform the public discourse around climate-related fiduciary duties, and, importantly, help corporate decision-makers and their counsel to understand the range of permitted corporate climate action. Interdisciplinary scholarship is also vital to address areas where climate-related fiduciary duties intersect with other bodies of law. Participants in the Colloquium are already conducting groundbreaking research at the intersection of fiduciary duty and transactional law, religious freedom, and antitrust, among other areas. Greater resources are necessary to support these efforts and generate scholarship that responds to the pressures and exigencies of climate change across all sectors and practice areas. The Colloquium also highlighted key areas where researchers can respond to legal developments that are undermining climate action. It is clear that courts, commentators, and corporate legal decisionmakers often use flawed assumptions about the physical, economic, and societal impacts of climate change. Elsewhere, judicial decisions around fiduciary duty are often laden with assumptions drawn from Law and Economics literature that do not necessarily reflect the reality of markets or the full impact of climate change. For example, consider when courts are asked to use the present value of shares as a metric of corporate harm: this seemingly neutral approach depends on a version of the efficient markets hypothesis, which presumes that markets incorporate important information into the price of stocks. However, many studies suggest that climate change-related risk is imperfectly priced by capital markets. There is a significant need for research and scholarship that identifies the underlying assumptions of corporate law, and assesses where such assumptions may fail under the physical, economic, and societal pressures of climate change. Through its the Initiative on Climate Risk and Resilience Law (ICRRL), the Climate Law & Finance Initiative (CLFI), the Sabin Center is committed advancing this research and building on the complex discussions raised during Colloquium. As ever, the Center welcomes scholars and practitioners to contribute their expertise and efforts to advance a whole-society approach to the urgent challenges of climate change.

Title: Report: Crypto Firm Anchorage Digital Bank Investigated by Homeland Security

Crypto company Anchorage Digital Bank is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The nature of the investigation is not known, but the DHS organization that is running it — the El Dorado Task Force — is dedicated to combating money laundering and other financial crimes, Barron’s reported Monday (April 14), citing unnamed sources. As part of its investigation, the task force has contacted former Anchorage Digital Bank employees and asked about the firm’s practices and policies, according to the report. Neither Anchorage Digital Bank nor the Department of Homeland Security immediately replied to PYMNTS’ request for comment. Anchorage Digital Bank offers asset safeguarding and trading services to financial institutions and governments, according to the Barron’s report. The bank was flagged by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April 2022 for failing to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) mandates and violating rules for monitoring suspicious activity. The OCC said at the time that Anchorage Digital Bank failed to adopt a compliance program that met Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and AML protocols after being granted a conditional charter in January 2021. “The OCC holds all nationally chartered banks to the same high standards, whether they engage in traditional or novel activities,” then-Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said in an April 2022 press release. “When institutions fall short, we will take action and hold them accountable to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations.” Anchorage Digital Bank, which didn’t admit or deny the OCC’s findings, agreed to correct the issues, the OCC said at the time. In a January 2023 press release, the Anchorage Digital Bank said it had strengthened its team and revamped its BSA/AML and compliance programs. “We’ve also taken specific steps to enhance technology capabilities to enable monitoring transactions in a programmatic, scalable way,” the release said. “With our new technology platform, these hires and our continuous investment in staff, we will ensure that our institutional platform continues to maintain the security-first approach that has differentiated us from the beginning.” On Tuesday (April 8), Anchorage Digital Bank said it deepened its relationship with BlackRock to provide digital custody, becoming an additional custodian eligible to support spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) and other BlackRock funds providing exposure to crypto.

Title: Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon Says Tariffs Could Spook International Clients

In recent days, Wall Street CEOs have offered various predictions about how the Trump administration’s tariff policy could impact their business abroad. Some have cautioned unavoidable fallout, while others claim their international dealings won’t be impacted. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs (GS), appears to fall somewhere in the middle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. “What we’re hearing from clients, particularly clients in Europe and other places around the world, is they don’t like the level of uncertainty,” said Solomon during the investment bank’s first-quarter earnings call today (April 14). When it comes to how this sentiment will play out for a global financial institution like Goldman Sachs, “it’s early to call heads or tails,” noted the CEO. Markets have been reeling since April 2, when President Donald Trump unveiled the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs—an across-the-board 10 percent levy, with additional “reciprocal” duties targeting countries based on their trade deficits. China, notably, has seen its tariffs raised to 145 percent, while most of the other reciprocal levies have been paused for 90 days. But tariff-induced anxieties remain. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), warned last week that his bank “will be in the crosshairs” as international clients and countries begin to feel differently about American financial institutions. Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO Ted Pick had a more positive take last week, saying he remains “bullish” on his firm’s global business. Solomon, meanwhile, believes it’s too soon to tell. While the executive told analysts today that international clients are currently “extremely engaged” with the bank and there isn’t a decline of business on the horizon, Solomon noted that short-term concerns are particularly pronounced outside of the U.S. In some ways, recent market volatility has been beneficial to Goldman Sachs. Heightened levels of uncertainty have spurred a rise in trading, driving up the bank’s equity trading revenue to $4.19 billion in the first three months of this year—a 27 percent year-over-year increase. Total revenue climbed 6 percent to $15.06 billion for the quarter, and profit rose 15 percent to $4.74 billion. Both figures beat estimates. Goldman shares rose 2.3 percent on the results today. At the close of 2024, Solomon predicted a surge in mergers and acquisitions under a renewed Trump administration. So far, the reality has been the opposite. Goldman Sachs’ latest earnings reveal a clear slowdown in dealmaking, with investment banking fees dropping 8 percent year-over-year to $1.91 billion. The bank’s deal backlog has grown for the fourth consecutive quarter, Solomon noted, though he added that “our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions.” Solomon, like other Wall Street leaders, has become increasingly worried about said market conditions leading to a broader economic downturn. During today’s earnings call, he warned that slowing economic activity around the globe means that “the prospect of a recession has increased.” Dimon echoed similar concerns last week, putting the odds of a recession this year at 50/50. Other finance titans, like Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), have declared that the U.S. might already be in one. For the time being, Solomon is urging calm. “My guess is, over time, this level of uncertainty will come down,” he said. “My general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: MSC Founder Emerges as Key Player in $19B Global Ports Deal

Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach By Alessandra Migliaccio and Tara Patel Bloomberg) — Gianluigi Aponte, the secretive Italian billionaire who founded MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co SA, has emerged as a powerful broker in a $19 billion port deal with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Aponte and his family-controlled Terminal Investment Ltd., known as TiL, are the main investors in a consortium that has proposed a $19 billion accord to buy 43 ports from Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings, people familiar with the matter have said. The grouping includes BlackRock Inc. and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, which will control two of the ports in Panama. GIP also has a minority stake in TiL. The deal has thrust the 84-year-old Aponte into an uncharacteristically high-profile position while underscoring his firm’s increasingly dominant role in worldwide shipping. MSC has grown to control about a fifth of global shipping capacity, and Aponte has a net worth of $25.6 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The low-key Aponte, silver-haired and slight of build, rarely speaks in public or gives interviews. His closely held company doesn’t publish financial reports or strategy updates. Still, he’s a member of the exclusive club of ultra-wealthy European shipping magnates who earned huge windfalls during the pandemic, and who’ve been expanding their empires ever since. The group includes the Maersk-Uggla family behind Danish container line AP Moller-Maersk A/S, Klaus-Michael Kuehne, Germany’s richest man, who has a 30% stake in Hapag-Lloyd AG, and Rodolphe Saade and his family, who control CMA CGM SA. The Aponte family traces its seafaring roots back to 1675, according to its corporate website. Gianluigi Aponte was born near the Bay of Naples, where the family traditionally ferried goods and passengers. He trained as a ship’s captain and later operated ferries shuttling wealthy tourists to island resorts like Capri and Ischia. It was on one of those trips that he met his future wife, Rafaela Diamant, the daughter of a Swiss banker. Aponte started MSC in 1970 after purchasing an old German break-bulk ship, and the following year he bought a second vessel, naming it after his wife. He soon began buying secondhand container ships, some from scrapyards, as he looked to break into a business dominated by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. After carving out a niche on under-served routes, MSC eventually distinguished itself by emphasizing price over delivery speed. In the late 1980s Aponte made the jump into the leisure segment, and MSC Cruises became the world’s third-largest cruise brand. Like his European shipping peers, Aponte pushed heavily into ports and logistics. MSC’s pandemic-era profits fueled a further rapid expansion drive, and by 2022 it had achieved its founder’s goal of becoming the world’s biggest container carrier, dropping Maersk into second place. Aponte’s son Diego became MSC’s group president in 2014. Still, the senior Aponte remains highly active in MSC’s management as group chairman, with decision-making closely concentrated among the extended family, according to industry executives. Diego Aponte also heads the board of Geneva-based TiL where his father is a director, according to its website, which lists its shareholders as MSC, BlackRock’s GIP and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: More than 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next 6 months as tariff turmoil grows, survey says

Morning Rundown: Trump’s immigration pressure campaign, Biden hits back in post-presidency speech, and Gene Hackman investigation findings Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time A growing majority of America’s top executives now expects the U.S. economy to enter a recession in the near future, according to a survey released Monday. Of the more than 300 CEOs polled in April, 62% said they forecasted a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months, according to Chief Executive, an industry group that runs the survey. That’s up from 48% who said the same in March. Chief Executive’s data underscores the growing concern within corporate America around the future of the U.S. economy. Fears about a forthcoming recession hit a boiling point in the last two weeks, as President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff policy ratcheted up volatility in financial markets and stirred panic among some consumers. Indeed, around three-fourths of CEOs surveyed said tariffs would hurt their businesses in 2025. About two-thirds said they did not support Trump’s proposed levies, many of which are currently on pause. The monthly survey, which has run since 2002, includes several data points that paint a concerning picture of how America’s foremost business leaders view the economy. An index of CEOs’ views on current business conditions tumbled 9% in April, continuing its decline after plunging 20% in the prior month. The measure now sits at its lowest level since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. When forecasting business conditions a year out, CEOs held their view steady from March. Still, these readings were the lowest since late 2012 and have tanked around 29% from the end of 2024. The survey found that more than four out of five chief executives project costs spiking this year, which is no surprise given the ongoing negotiations over import taxes between the White House and foreign countries. Around half forecast their percentage increases in expenses to be in the double digits. In this vein, just 37% said they believe their companies’ profits will increase. That’s a steep drop from the 76% who gave this response in January. To be sure, Chief Executive’s data set included a few bright spots. Slightly over half of respondents said they foresee business conditions bettering over the next year, an increase from the 39% share seen a month earlier. Many CEOs may be getting some tariff relief as well. Trump late Friday announced that smartphones and PCs would be exempt from duties, though Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these exemptions would be temporary. Chief Executive’s data comes as U.S. business leaders have started flashing warning signs on the country’s economic future. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that he expects earnings estimates for S&P 500 firms to fall due to the uncertainty around Trump’s levies. Also on Friday, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that the U.S. economy may have already weakened to the point of growth coming in negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Share this article The US Department of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force has launched an investigation into Anchorage Digital Bank, the first and only chartered digital asset bank in the US, Barron’s reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The task force, which focuses on combating money laundering and other financial crimes, has contacted former Anchorage employees as part of its investigation. However, the details of the probe are currently unknown. Anchorage Digital is a recognized name in the digital asset space, having partnered with major institutions like Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed by Howard Lutnick, who currently serves as commerce secretary under the Trump administration, and also with BlackRock. Last November, Cantor Fitzgerald established a partnership with Anchorage and Copper to act as collateral managers and custodians for its new global Bitcoin financing business. The collaboration aims to offer top-tier digital asset custody services, starting with $2 billion in initial financing. BlackRock has recently tapped the bank for its spot crypto ETF custody. The fund management giant offers two spot ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the IBIT and ETHA funds. As of March 31, BlackRock’s spot crypto ETFs had around $50 billion in assets under management, according to its Q1 earnings report. This isn’t the first time Anchorage Digital has encountered regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) took action against its banking arm for failing to meet BSA/AML obligations under its operating agreement.

Title: How the Business Community Turned Back Tariffs—for Now

Objections from business leaders played a key role in pushing the Trump Administration to reverse course on recently announced “reciprocal” tariffs, according to Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques. It’s a win for business, they write, but the business community remains concerned about uncertainty around economic policy. This commentary originally appeared in Time. The views expressed are the authors’ own.‌ It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs.‌ While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ‌ Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. ‌ Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation.‌ In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. ‌ Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. ‌ The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. ‌ The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. ‌ Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. ‌ The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here.

Title: Taoiseach hails €1bn-plus ‘Cluas’ light rail project in Cork

Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) The new €1bn-plus Cork light rail project will prove transformational for the city, the Taoiseach has promised. Micheál Martin was speaking as he launched the eight-week public consultation process on the emerging preferred route for the project, which has already been nicknamed 'Cluas' on Leeside. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km light-rail line with up to 25 stops running from Ballincollig through the city centre to Mahon Point. It will link key Cork destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. The scheme includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. No overall cost has yet been specified for the scheme but it has been projected at €1bn to €2bn. The emerging preferred route also includes a proposed 1,000-vehicle park & ride facility in Ballincollig and a special mobility hub in Mahon. Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the launch of the Luas Cork Emerging Preferred Route Public Consultation (Niall Carson/PA) News in 90 Seconds - 14 April 2025 When fully operational, it will handle up to 2,300 passengers per hour with a forecast demand of 16 million passengers per annum. There will be no overhead cables in Cork city centre - and 65,000 Cork city residents will live within a 15-minute walk of a Luas stop. It will offer a 20-minute link between Mahon and Cork city centre and 35 minutes from the city centre to Ballincollig. A key element of the plan is a high-quality interchange at Cork's main railway hub, Kent Station. Mr Martin said light rail was vital to cater for the future transport needs of an expanding Cork. It will be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years with a population targeted to grow by 50pc to 60pc as the city strives to become a counterweight to Dublin and the east coast. The Taoiseach refused to specify a timeframe for completion of Luas Cork and said its rate of funding would be determined by future economic and fiscal issues. “Luas Cork will hugely improve connectivity in the city by modernising the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses," he said. "This is a very significant day for the public of Cork - this will be a transformative transport project for Cork city. "We are looking overall at a transport investment and network that will meet the needs of a growing city with a huge projected increase in population over the next 20 years. "It is very positive to see this project progressing and from that point of view I would like to acknowledge the work done by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and indeed Cork City Council. “With the consultation process now open, I would encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views on this exciting proposal.” Transport Minister Darragh O'Brien said such public transport investments were absolutely crucial for Ireland successfully preparing for future population growth. "The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal. By providing a modern, reliable, and efficient public transport option, Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality." "The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Dan Boyle said the city had been waiting a long time for such a critical investment as Luas Cork. "It is a long-awaited, missing but vital link in the city's transport infrastructure, it will provide real choice to have more people travel by public transport, reduce car dependency, connect key locations and allow for significant additional growth in the development of the city." "The challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame." Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: President Trump: The Tariff Czar. Tariffs Impact Whose Economies?

Time Published: 2025-04-14T13:52:28Z

President Trump called 2 April 2025 “Liberation Day” because this is the day when he announced new sweeping tariffs across the board, meaning, indeed, on all countries across the world. He might as well have called it “Day of Reckoning.” Did it signal the beginning of a global trade war? Or, is it just a game by which self-centered President Trump wants to show-off again, as being the one who commands the game, the one who can bend the world to its knees. Or so, he believes. But at what cost? And for whom to pay the cost? It is a dangerous game, more a gamble than a game. It is the gamble of a typical deal-maker – the extreme is “lose it all,” that is the direction this is going or win it all. “Win it all” for Trump, i.e. the US, is no option. There are too many smarter players around the globe. By now, at least 75 countries are begging Trump to “negotiate” bilateral tariff structures. It is not so much a question of cost for the partner countries, but for the US themselves. Washington has much more to lose than the rest of the world. Trump’s aim seems clear: 1) bring back outsourced manufacturing to the US; and 2) attract foreign new investments for manufacturing in the US, with significant tax breaks for new investors. The cost of either option is astronomical, and even if some countries / corporations are willing to take the risk of moving their manufacturing from a low-wage to a high-wage country – it doesn’t happen overnight. What happens in the meantime when new markets must be found? Who needs US goods? They hardly produce anything. Most everything you buy in the US is “made in China.” Even Trump’s red MAGA hat is “made in China.” American consumers will suffer the most. A couple of days ago, Trump increased tariffs for Chinese imports from 84% to 125%. He said, attempting to justify his move before the rest of the world, increased duties are intended to make China realize that “ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that this was “based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world’s markets.” Interesting though, how come everybody buys Chinese goods, not just because they are cheaper than US and other western goods, but also because Chinese quality in many cases is way superior. Chinese production is not subject to the US and western traditional corruption. Just look at the hundreds of billions-worth of corruption scandals the European Union (EU) is involved in, especially the unelected President Ursula Von der Leyen, or shall we say Dr. Von der Leyen, as in June 2022, she received an honorary doctorate from the Israeli Ben-Gurion University. See video below and this. Ms. von der Leyen said to her doctorate award: “Our democracy flourishes if Jewish life in Europe flourishes, too. Throughout the centuries, the Jewish people have been ‘a light unto the nations’. And they shall be a light unto Europe for many centuries ahead. (…) Long live Europe! Am Israel Chai!” Amen. This made Ursula Von der Leyen a forever Zionist, forever protected by the Zionists ruling the world; like President Trump when in 2017 he converted to Judaism. She is now not only guarded against several lawsuits, because the EU grants her diplomatic immunity, indeed also protecting her buddies-in-crime; but now she is also protected by the ever-Chosen People, the Zionists of Israel and around the world. * Back to the tariff game that must go on. It is an utterly destructive game in the end for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. Good for China, who does not need the US market as much as the US market needs China. China makes believe gambling in tandem with Trump. China just upped the ante. They increased their tariffs for US goods also to 125% – however saying, that is it. No higher. No matter what Trump does, we will not increase tariffs any further. In casino lingo that means, “Les jeux sont faits”. See this. Trump is – again – shooting from the hips. Or was and is it a plan? If it is a planned game, it could backfire miserably for the US. But Trump seems wanting to keep the game going, like a drunken gambler. In this game or gamble, the biggest players are China and to a lesser extent the EU. The EU is considering retaliation tariffs of 25%; while most individual EU countries talk about 20%. For now, tariffs are suspended for 90 days on both sides of the Atlantic, as negotiations are being “prepared”. The EU is divided. There are those who say enough is enough, let us open up to China and Asia in general. Eurasia is a natural partner and an already well-structured market. Forget the oppressive US of A. Others cannot believe that the US may drop the EU, and still want to adhere to this losing game by tallying up to Mr. Trump’s Washington. In the end, Europe has never been an independent force on her own – thousands of years of exploitation, back to the Roman Empire, and before, colonizing others, up to this very day. They will eventually fall by their own weight into the abyss created between the two fronts. Just in case, an EU retaliation would have similar effects on the European consumer – at a variation, depending on the importance of US imports for European consumers. This maybe the reason for EU’s semi-clandestine approach to China for increasing trade with China – of course, officially a “no-no”, according to the EU’s own copycat sanctioning of China, as dictated by the Trump Administration. For China, the game is already won. China for years has oriented its market towards Asia, the ASEAN countries, including the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), comprising of 15 Asia-Pacific nations. The agreement, under preparation for ten years, entered into force on 1 January 2022, encompasses about a third of the world’s population and a third of the world’s GDP. The value of RCEP trade is expected to reach the equivalent of about third of the world’s GDP by 2030. China also has the Belt and Road Infrastructure, Investment and Trade Initiative spanning the globe, independently of Trump’s tariff fiasco. In addition, China, a cofounder of BRICS, is strongly committed to BRICS-plus inter-trading, as well as with the Global South (GS) in general. The GS will soon outstrip economic parameters of the G7. In Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), the GS is already stronger than the G7. China has no market problem without the US. But the US are likely heading towards enormous internal socioeconomic problems, without Chinese goods or high duties on Chinese goods which make them unaffordable to the American consumer – especially middle and lower end consumers. Inflation and unemployment will be soaring. But the tariff game continues. It is a destructive game for the US, but a game it is. And China plays along. China does not really need the US market as much as the US market needs China. Everything in the US is “made in China.” You stop the “Made in China” by ridiculous tariffs and the US comes to a standstill – because of inflation, labor loss and an uprooting of the American society – they may not take it. Specially the middle-lower income levels are losing sizable amounts of their purchasing power as compared with their 2024 incomes. Some analysts are comparing Trump to the stubborn Roman emperors. He cannot succeed. Irrespective of whether Trump politically survives his brutal tariff offensive, a U-turn is imminent, if he wants to avoid major domestic upheavals. The Budget Lab, a research center at Yale University, had estimated the toll on the average household at about US$ 3,800 annually, as compared with the spending power of 2024. See this for what it means in terms of inflation or consumer loss in 2024 US incomes. At the same time, Trump announced a military budget of about a trillion US dollars. This is brilliant logic of an extravagant megalomaniac. Or is there something else behind it? Are the global tariffs and the war budget deviously linked? According to the Budget Lab study, accumulated 2025 US import tariffs were scheduled to grow higher than ever since 1909. The stock market cratering alone wiped out about US$ 5 trillion. Since the first announcement of the tariff shock, the stock market has been like a roller-coaster. Some of the more significant market losses may be recuperated as Trump will negotiate bilaterally; or more, in case he will have to make an inevitable U-turn. Whatever you may call it, it is at best: “Radical policy changes” and an “unpredictable disruption.” In the light of the just announced one trillion US-dollar war budget, the imminent question arising: Is this game supposed to hide the fact that Trump is unable, or never was really willing, to achieve peace, neither in Ukraine, nor in the Middle East, because the profit stakes are too high for the war industry, and – possessing Ukraine and her riches is just too tempting to let it go. BlackRock has already privatized about half the country without most Ukrainians, let alone the rest of the world – noticing. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Goldman Sachs earnings jump but CEO sees 'markedly different' environment coming

Goldman Sachs (GS+1.93%) opened the floodgates on first-quarter earnings Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. Strong trading revenues fueled the beat, and shares climbed 1.7% at the open — despite being down about 14% year-to-date. CEO David Solomon struck a confident tone while acknowledging extreme uncertainty amid chaotic U.S. policy turns. “In times of great uncertainty, clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight,” he said, while noting that Q2 has brought “a markedly different operating environment.” Goldman’s performance is a reminder that Wall Street firms often find ways to thrive in turmoil. As a barometer of capital flows and investor sentiment, the bank’s earnings show that volatility, while unsettling, isn’t always unprofitable. The strong showing adds to solid reports from other financial giants last week, including BlackRock (BLK+2.04%), JPMorgan Chase (JPM-0.63%) and Morgan Stanley (MS+1.48%). Still, clouds are forming: analysts at both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup (C+3.39%) cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, warning of slowing earnings, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable U.S. policy. With heavyweight companies like Netflix (NFLX+2.09%), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ+1.73%), and UnitedHealth (UNH-1.96%) reporting in the days ahead, investors will be watching closely to see whether the bounce continues — or buckles under pressure.

Title: Investors pull $795 million from crypto ETPs, XRP continues to buck trend with inflows

Trump's tariff uncertainties lead to a draining investment landscape for crypto assets, except for rising XRP. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The digital asset market faced another challenging week, with $795 million in outflows recorded across crypto investment products, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This marks the third consecutive week of declines, underlining growing caution among investors navigating global economic headwinds. The ongoing streak of negative sentiment has pushed total outflows since early February to $7.2 billion. These withdrawals have nearly erased 2025’s earlier gains, leaving net inflows for the year at a modest $165 million. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that much of the recent investor caution stems from renewed tariff tensions involving the United States and China. Last week, the United States and China reignited their tariff dispute, each imposing a 25% levy on incoming goods. While President Donald Trump briefly paused broader tariff actions for 90 days, the damage to investor sentiment had already been done. CoinShares noted that short-term relief helped digital assets under management (AuM) climb to $130 billion, an 8% rebound from the April 8 low, the lowest level since November 2024. According to the report, Bitcoin products experienced $751 million in outflows, although the asset still maintains $545 million in year-to-date inflows. Major Bitcoin ETF issuers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, saw significant fund exits during this period. Short Bitcoin products also experienced $4.6 million in outflows, suggesting that investors aren’t simply rotating into bearish positions. Meanwhile, Ethereum posted the second-largest outflows at $37.6 million, while other altcoins such as Solana, Aave, and Sui also saw declines of $5.1 million, $780,000, and $580,000, respectively. However, not all assets followed the trend. XRP continued to draw in fresh capital with inflows of $3.5 million last week, boosting its year-to-date inflows to $176 million, making it one of the best-performing digital assets in 2025. XRP’s inflow this year can be linked to the growing optimism over potential regulatory reforms and speculation around a spot XRP ETF in the US. Other altcoins, including Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche, posted modest inflows of around $250,000 each, showing that niche investor interest in select assets remains intact despite broader market weakness.

Title: Trump's trade war is eroding US billionaires' fortunes — while China's are getting even richer

America's tech titans have lost billions this year while their Chinese rivals have racked up large wealth gains amid President Donald Trump's tariff-induced trade war. The tariffs have reignited fears of inflation and recession in the US, spurring investors to dump high-flying tech stocks in favor of safer holdings such as gold and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The sell-off has hammered the net worths of most of the richest Americans, whose stakes in tech companies make up the vast majority of their wealth. Trump has aimed some of the highest duties at imports from China, putting the world's second-largest economy under more pressure. Nevertheless, Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly this year at the prospect of friendlier regulation and fresh government stimulus, boosting the fortunes of China's tech elite. As of Friday's close, the 20 biggest gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index have grown their combined wealth by $139 billion this year — more than BlackRock is worth. Meanwhile, the 20 largest wealth losers have seen $450 billion vaporized, a figure greater than Exxon Mobil's market value. It's striking that nine of the top 20 gainers are Chinese and only four are American, while 15 of the 20 biggest losers are American and none are Chinese. That trend may speak to how their companies' outlooks have changed, at least in the eyes of the global investment community, and how the US and China are expected to fare in the trade war. The Chinese executives racking up wealth this year include Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, and BYD founder Wang Chuanfu. They've jointly added a combined $26 billion, with Zhang gaining $13.6 billion, or 31%, to $57 billion — putting him in 24th place on the rich list. The US bosses hit hardest are Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. They've lost a collective $193 billion, with Musk shedding $121 billion or 28%. The richest Americans have lost far more than the Chinese elite have gained for a few reasons. Their fortunes are larger, so a 10% swing in their net worth is a bigger move in dollar terms. US stocks as a whole are more richly valued than Chinese equities, making them more vulnerable to steeper declines. It's also worth underscoring the greater role of the Chinese government in shoring up its markets and supporting domestic champions, which can help to limit declines in Chinese stocks. Vladimir Popov, a principal researcher at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in Moscow, told Business Insider that China's more equal income and wealth distribution and more collectivist culture than the US were key to its global competitiveness — and thus the wealth of its richest executives. The economic development scholar added that China having fewer billionaires than the US, who wield less political influence than their American counterparts, help it to weather trade wars, probably because it's easier to maintain a united front. Chinese billionaires' wealth gains also reflect their companies' strong progress. For example, BYD's sales of electric and hybrid vehicles surged by 40% to a record $107 billion last year, surpassing Tesla's revenues of $98 billion, as the Chinese EV maker made inroads into foreign markets. Meanwhile, Tesla stock is under pressure not only because of Musk's proximity to Trump and leading role in cutting government spending and workers, but also because of concerns about tariffs and competition. Politics aside, Tesla has "struggled with an ageing line up, recalls of its much-vaunted Cybertruck and increased competition, especially from Chinese players like BYD," said Danni Hewson of AJ Bell in a recent note. If Chinese executives scale the global wealth ladder while American titans slide down the rungs, it could signal a sea change in market sentiment — and an upheaval of the global economic order.

Title: Kennedy Wilson refinances €472m of Irish apartment portfolio debt

Kennedy Wilson, the US-based property investment giant, has secured a refinancing deal for $510 million (€472 million) related to debts secured against a portfolio of Irish apartments that were due to mature this year. The group, which last year sold its stake in Dublin’s five-star Shelbourne Hotel to Archer Hotel Capital for around €260 million, said the new five-year deal replaces an existing $537 million mortgage, which represented around 40 per cent of its total debt maturities for 2025. The debt is secured against several high-profile apartment schemes in the Republic, primarily in Dublin, comprising 1,689 units, or just under half of Kennedy Wilson’s 3,500-unit Irish portfolio. The properties – including Clancy Quay in Islandbridge, Dublin 8, the luxury Grange East scheme in Blackrock, as well as the Elysian in Cork – are co-owned by Kennedy Wilson and the investment arm of insurer Axa through a joint venture company. Occupancy rates across the portfolio are 99.5 per cent and the assets produce an annual operating income of around $40.3 million, Kennedy Wilson said on Monday in US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filings. The interest rate on the new financing is 4.2 per cent, according to the SEC documents. In a separate statement, the California-headquartered group said it had secured competitive terms from new lenders Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank. “This refinancing process satisfied a large 2025 maturity for Kennedy Wilson and generated extremely strong market interest,” Mike Pegler, president of Kennedy Wilson Europe said. “We secured competitive terms from a diverse pool of over 30 potential lenders, including both local and international banks, insurers and debt funds. This is a testament to the quality of this portfolio as well as the underlying strength of the apartment market in Ireland, where we have invested since 2012.” The Irish Times reported in March that Kennedy Wilson was looking to secure upwards of €145 million from the sale of two prime office investments in Dublin’s city centre and docklands. CBRE and Knight Frank have been tasked by the US property giant with finding a buyer for 20 Kildare Street, which houses tenants includingAra Partners, Consello, Davidson Kempner Capital Management, Dentons, Egon Zehnder and Lanthorn and generates a rent roll of around €4 million annually. It is also understood to have instructed CBRE and Savills to sell office accommodation at Capital Dock, the landmark mixed-use scheme in Dublin’s south docklands.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/14 update below. This post was originally published on April 13 Donald Trump’s escalating global trade war has pushed markets to the brink this week, causing a spiralling U.S. dollar "confidence crisis" amid fears of "collapse." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The Federal Reserve, which stepped in to calm markets during the Covid panic, is closely watching the $29 trillion Treasury market for signs convulsions caused by Trump’s tariffs could turn into a full-blown financial crisis (while Wall Street braces for a looming “existential” threat). Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprise prediction, a top Federal Reserve official has said it “would absolutely be prepared" to step in to rescue markets if U.S. president Trump’s trade war threatens the financial system. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has triggered chaos on financial markets with his on-again, off-again ... More trade war, tanking stock markets and sending the bitcoin price and crypto markets on a rollercoaster. “We have had to deploy quite quickly, various tools,” Susan Collins, head of the Boston Fed, told the Financial Times, referring to previous times the Fed has moved to calm chaotic markets at times of low liquidity or market malfunctions. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” However, Collins, who fears Trump’s tariff trade war could send inflation back above 3% in 2025, said that currently “markets are continuing to function well” and that “we’re not seeing liquidity concerns overall," adding the Fed “does have tools to address concerns about market functioning or liquidity should they arise.” 04/14 update: JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has predicted the Federal Reserve will be forced to step in and bail out the near-$30 trillion U.S. Treasury market following U.S. president Donald Trump’s campaign of rapid-fire global tariffs. “There will be a kerfuffle in the Treasury markets because of all the rules and regulations,” Dimon said in a Friday earnings call, warning that the Fed won’t act until “they start to panic a little bit." Dimon suggested the Fed could ditch a rule that exempts Treasuries from leverage ratio calculations, something that would allow institutional investors to buy more bonds without breaking capital requirement rules. “If they don’t [change the rules], the Fed will have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea,” Dimon said. The suggestion has been seized on as bullish by Bitmex cofounder and Maelstrom chief investment officer Arthur Hayes, who posted to X that: “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.” "[Supplementary leverage ratio] exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital," Hayes added. Earlier this month, traders ramped up their bets that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars—though Collins said emergency rate cuts would not be the Fed’s primary tool for responding to market’s failing. In 2020, ahead of one of the largest ever stock market rallies that saw the bitcoin price and crypto market surge to never-before-seen heights, the Fed restarted its 2008 financial crisis-era programs of quantitative easing while cutting rates to near-zero and scrapping its cap on the number of Treasuries it could buy—fueling expectations the Fed could again turbo charge the bitcoin price. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. Collins’ comments come as the New York Fed’s John Williams has warned that Trump’s tariffs could send inflation spiralling, caused a wave of unemployment and damage U.S. economic growth. This coming week, Fed chair Jerome Powell, who is at loggerheads with Trump over the need for interest rate cuts, is due to speak at the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday in what will be a closely-watched speech. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set ahead of Donald ... More Trump's inauguration as global markets convulse over Trump's trade tariffs. Trump’s fast-moving approach to tariffs and trade negotiation—that’s seen China hit with levies of almost 150% before a carve out was announced for smartphones, computers and some other electronics—has seen the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield jump 0.5 percentage points to 4.5% over the past week, spooking markets with its outsized swings. Crypto and stock markets have been on a rollercoaster that’s caused some of the most extreme volatility ever seen. After Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs, the S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever following a steep multi-trillion dollar sell-off. The notoriously volatile bitcoin price and crypto market has swung from highs of $3 trillion late March to lows of $2.5 trillion in early April before rebounding back toward $3 trillion. Meanwhile, business leaders on Wall Street and across the U.S. are warning the economy is buckling under the pressure of tariff uncertainty. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned the U.S. may already be in a recession due to Trump’s sweeping tariffs while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon has said recession is the “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade war.

LAST UPDATE | 14 Apr THE EMERGING PREFERRED Route for Luas Cork has been launched today by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and is open to public consultation for the next eight weeks. Luas Cork is a proposed 18km long light rail line with up to 24 stops running from Ballincollig to Mahon Point. It will connect key destinations such as MTU, Cork University Hospital, UCC, Cork city centre, Kent Station, Cork Docklands, Blackrock and Mahon. Luas Cork route map The scheme also includes a new public transport bridge connecting Kent Station to Kennedy Quay and new cycling infrastructure along much of the route. The Emerging Preferred Route also includes a proposed 1000 vehicle Park & Ride facility in Ballincollig and a Mobility Hub in Mahon. Cork is planned to be the fastest-growing city in Ireland over the next 20 years, with a population targeted to grow by 50 to 60% and projects such as Luas Cork are seen as vital to delivering the large-scale regeneration and investment planned for Cork. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) and the National Transport Authority (NTA) is inviting the public to participate in the consultation on www.luascork.ie. The consultation is open until Monday 9 June at 5.30pm. There will also be a number of open days across the city during the consultation where drawings can be inspected and staff from TII will be available to answer questions. Martin described the announcement today of the Emerging Preferred Route a “significant step in an infrastructure project that will be transformational for Cork city”. He added that it is government’s plan to do “whatever we can effectively and in a timely matter”. Advertisement Martin said the project will “modernise the city’s public transport network, making it more accessible and creating new opportunities for residents, visitors and local businesses”. “With the consultation process now open, I’d encourage everybody to take this opportunity to provide their feedback and share their views,” said Martin. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Darragh O’Brien TD noted that Cork has been selected by the European Commission as one of Europe’s first climate-neutral cities. In 2022, the European Commission announced that Cork is to become one of Europe’s first climate neutral cities. Cork, along with Dublin, was selected from a group of 337 cities to participate in the EU Mission for 100 climate-neutral cities by 2030. “The development of Luas Cork will play a key role in achieving this goal,” said O’Brien. “Luas Cork will encourage a shift away from private car use, reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving air quality. “The project will also complement other sustainable transport initiatives, such as expanded bus services and enhanced cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” O’Brien, who last month said the Luas Cork could cost between €2 billion and €3 billion, added that it’s “very difficult to estimate” how much the project will cost. Lord Mayor of Cork City Dan Boyle meanwhile remarked that the “challenge is to see it constructed and operating in the shortest possible time frame”. Elsewhere, Hugh Creegan, interim CEO of the NTA said that Luas Cork will be the “new era of public transport which will enable Cork to develop into an accessible, connected and vibrant city” while Peter Walsh, CEO of TII, said he looked forward to hearing from the public before progressing to the next stage of design. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said that she wants to “see things moving very fast”. “It has taken too long,” said Bacik, who called for construction to begin by 2030. “There is a very clear outline coming through and things should move on swiftly and we will be pushing government to make sure it does progress at pace.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Former Siena Heights University CFO says she was fired for finding fraud: Trial Balance

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Debi Andrews claims she was fired for enforcing financial controls and advising an administrator to file an alleged sexual harassment claim against the college’s president. The Trial Balance is CFO.com’s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare. Debi Andrews, the former CFO of Siena Heights University, a small Catholic college in Adrian, Michigan, claims she was fired for refusing to lie to the school’s board of directors about budget irregularities and for allegedly advising a colleague to file a sex discrimination complaint against university president Douglas Palmer. According to the complaint, “had Andrews not opposed Defendants’ fraud and encouraged her coworkers to complain about [Palmer’s] discriminatory behavior, she would not have been terminated.” The university said it is taking the allegations seriously but told MLive it cannot discuss pending litigation or personnel matters. It said it believes personnel decisions were made after “a thorough and careful review of the situation.” Andrews, who took the position in February 2024, reported that athletic coaches were making improper check requests from "fundraising accounts.” She also said expenses were improperly labeled as student-related when money was being spent for personal use. In the summer of that same year, just months into her role, Andrews opposed Palmer’s proposed budget because she claimed it was “not based on sound accounting.” She said she refused to lie to the board of directors about “what the university had done in order to secure the funding.” Days later, according to the complaint, she was placed on unpaid leave. The case also details how Andrews and Palmer’s working relationship deteriorated after she advised a female administrator to file a sexual harassment complaint against Palmer. The unnamed employee’s working relationship with Palmer allegedly changed after the administrator refused to join him at a local bar. Though it isn’t clear how Andrews believes Palmer found out about the advice she gave to another employee, she links this as the second of two causes that ultimately led to her dismissal. Andrews’ lawsuit also names the university’s former director of human resources Fran Johnson, saying she told others that Andrews was having inappropriate relationships with university staff in campus facilities. These allegations were used, according to the lawsuit, as the basis for a “retaliatory and unfounded investigation” launched after Andrews was placed on unpaid leave. In an interview with MLive, Johnson denied all allegations against her. Siena Heights University’s financial impact is felt far beyond the university’s campus. The college is owned by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, who have notably led multiple shareholder activism campaigns at companies like Dicks Sporting Goods, Smith and Wesson and American Outdoor Brands Corporation. Their efforts, which have been supported by major investors like BlackRock, have led to changes around corporate responsibility, particularly around firearms.

Title: Ethereum vs. Ripple: Will XRP overtake ETH in the next 3 years?

Institutional participants show mixed signals as ETH struggles. As Ethereum [ETH] faces mounting pressure, ETF outflows have surged 39% in just one week, signaling shaken investor sentiment. Yet, in a show of confidence, BlackRock has doubled with a massive $1.8 billion ETH position, reinforcing institutional faith in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Just as the dust settles, Standard Chartered has stirred the pot, forecasting that Ripple [XRP] could overtake Ethereum within the next three years. With market dynamics shifting, the race for crypto’s second spot is entering what looks like a high-stakes war zone. Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly net outflows of $82.47 million – marking the largest drawdown in recent months. The chart reveals a clear trend: consistent outflows since mid-February, aligning with Ethereum’s price drop to $1.5K. Source: SoSoValue Total net assets have also steadily declined, now at $5.24 billion, down from a peak above $12 billion in late 2024. This suggests waning short-term investor confidence, even as macro conviction remains strong – evidenced by large institutions like BlackRock increasing exposure. The disconnect hints at a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s market narrative. Despite mounting ETF outflows, BlackRock has solidified its conviction in Ethereum with a $1.8 billion ETH position. The portfolio shows steady accumulation through 2024, signaling a long-term belief in Ethereum’s value proposition. However, a surprising twist enters the frame: Standard Chartered’s latest report forecasts XRP overtaking Ethereum in market cap by 2028. Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research, sees XRP rising to become the second-largest non-stablecoin asset, setting up a high-stakes rivalry. The result is a fascinating divergence in institutional outlooks — one doubling down on ETH, the other betting big on XRP. The mixed signals reveal just how uncertain and dynamic the road ahead for crypto’s top contenders truly is. Ethereum’s price hit $1,603 at press time, following a 2.47% daily drop. The broader trend since early 2025 has been decisively bearish, with ETH shedding significant value from above $3,000 levels earlier in the year. The RSI hovered near 39, indicating oversold territory but not yet signaling a strong reversal. Meanwhile, the MACD line sat just below the signal line, suggesting ongoing bearish momentum — although the gap is narrowing, hinting at potential bullish divergence. Source: TradingView Despite BlackRock’s conviction, technicals suggest ETH is still struggling to find solid footing. Any short-term relief rally could face resistance near the $1,800 zone, while a drop below $1,550 could intensify selling pressure.

Title: Topgolf Founders Raise $34 Million For Poolhouse, Their Latest Sports Startup

ByTim Casey ByTim Casey, Senior Contributor. FILE - David Blitzer participates in a New Jersey Devils press conference Thursday, Aug. 15, 2013, ... More in Newark, N.J. Major League Baseball has approved the sale of a minority stake in the Cleveland Guardians to David Blitzer, who also has ownership shares in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, two people familiar with the deal told the Associated Press on Thursday, June 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File) Poolhouse, a United Kingdom-based startup founded by the brothers behind Topgolf, has raised $34 million in a seed round. The company plans on using the proceeds to further develop its technology, gain a foothold in the competitive sports-themed entertainment retail industry and open locations where people can play a high-tech version of pool while eating, drinking and socializing. The seed round was co-led by Sharp Alpha, a venture capital firm based in New York, and dmg ventures, the venture capital arm of DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail newspaper among other holdings. David Blitzer, who owns a stake in the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils and invests in sports-focused startups, participated in the round, as did investment firms Simon Sports and Active Partners. Poolhouse declined to disclose the valuation of the company following the seed round, some of which it raised via a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) note that will convert to equity when the company raises a planned Series A next year. Poolhouse is the brainchild of twins Dave and Steve Jolliffe, who in 2000 started Topgolf to enhance the experience of going to a golf driving range. Topgolf merged in 2021 with Callaway in a deal that valued Topgolf at $2.1 billion. There are now 96 Topgolf locations in the U.S. and 12 locations in other countries. The Jolliffe brothers also founded Puttshack, a miniature golf entertainment concept that raised $150 million in October 2022 from Blackrock. There are 16 Puttshack locations in the U.S. and four in the United Kingdom. Poolhouse plans on opening its first venue early next year in London. The 21,348-square-foot, two-story building is located next to the city’s Liverpool Street Station and will house 20 pool tables with food and beverage options. The Poolhouse venues will have regular sized pool tables and pool cues, but the company has developed technology that will enhance the experience, including superimposing images on the table, creating various games people can play and allowing them to track their progress on an app and video screens. The company also has a system that can track how good players are and a handicapping system similar to golf that makes it more competitive among players who have various abilities. Andrew O’Brien, a former Credit Suisse banker who invested in Puttshack and sits on the board of F1 Arcade, is Poolhouse’s CEO and runs its day-to-day operations. Steve Jolliffe is Poolhouse’s executive chairman and speaks with O’Brien every day. The Jolliffes remain the largest individual shareholders in Poolhouse, according to O’Brien. “The look and the feel will be important, but ultimately, it’s what the Jolliffes did with Topgolf,” O’Brien said. “They create amazing technology to transform an existing sport. There's a reason why there weren't any Topgolf rivals for 20 years. It’s because they're very strong on the patent side of things. They don't just design pretty. They design things that are difficult to replicate.” O’Brien added: “With Poolhouse, I think they’ve done something very similar. They've created something on the back of technology, which is real pool tables, real pool balls, real cues. Everything's the same, but they've infused technology into it to augment the experience.” After launching in London, Poolhouse plans on opening two sites in the U.S., one in late 2026 and another in early 2027. The company plans on opening four to five locations per year in the U.S. starting in 2027 in downtown locations of major cities such as Boston, Chicago, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Poolhouse will lease space in buildings rather than own the buildings. Poolhouse has also struck a franchising agreement in Australia with Signature Hospitality Group, which has an equity stake in Poolhouse. Poolhouse expects to sign additional franchising or joint venture agreements in other countries. In addition, the company plans on licensing its technology to traditional pool halls, casinos, restaurants, apartment complexes and even homes or anywhere else that has a pool table. “We think there’s huge scope for this to be scaled across the world at quite a pace,” O’Brien said. Lloyd Danzig, managing partner of Sharp Alpha, said the venture capital firm spent 12 to 18 months evaluating companies in what he refers to as the “competitive socialization” or “eatertainment” industry, referring to Topgolf, Puttshack, F1 Arcade and other companies where people gather to socialize, eat, drink and compete in an activity. Sharp Alpha was looking for companies that had high food and drink spend at its venues, were conducive to corporate events, featured activities that could be done on a regular basis rather than a one-off basis and had proprietary software that could be licensed to a third parties at a high margin. He said he believes Poolhouse will meet all of those criteria. “They, more than any other concept we’ve come across, really embody all four of those features,” Danzig said. “The confluence of what we’re bullish on at the category level and also at the concept level and what they’re building dovetailed with just an absolutely incredible management and executive team. We give these guys an 11 out of 10 on founder-market fit.”
