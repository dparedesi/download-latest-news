We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 Stocks That Jim Cramer Recently Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to talk about the incoming Trump administration’s tariffs. Coupled with the Fed’s data-driven interest rates cycle, tariffs have created quite a stir on Wall Street as investors are wary of them contributing to inflationary pressures and making the central bank hesitate when it comes to reducing rates. He believes that one of the key issues surrounding tariffs is the interconnection between the US and China. Cramer shared that “I know many business people have talked to President-elect Trump and they’ve said, ‘It’s not as simple as steel. Steel’s a hundred thousand people, I mean some of these companies have three hundred, four hundred thousand people themselves. I think the problem is we’re so intertwined and a lot of people felt, you know what, when President Trump, or when he was President Trump, you basically felt you were supposed to go from China to Mexico. Seemed like a good deal. And Mexico seemed like, favored.” Since then, Cramer shared that the sentiment around Mexico has changed. According to him, the same people are now wondering “Why did we go to this country that apparently doesn’t like.” He also shed light on the relationship between China and Mexico and shared that “China and Mexico are strange bedfellows. China’s been flooding the country with autos! And, what we did was we moved all of our auto production down there! Also Germany, you go to Puebla, and it’s Volkswagen!” He added that this makes implementing tariffs tricky as “it’s just that the cars go back and forth, and back and forth, where, where do we put the tariff on? Where to we take it off?” However, while the market might be worried about the broader impact of tariffs, businesses are also excited about growing merger and acquisition activity. Cramer outlined that “very quickly, people just say, you know what, look, tariffs are so convoluted that something has to happen. But the idea that they can talk to other companies and maybe combine, they want that so badly.” Apart from his takes on stocks, some of Cramer’s most controversial views are of cryptocurrencies. While he doesn’t advocate completely shunning them, the tight-knit crypto community either panics when he’s bullish for Bitcoin due to the well-known inverse Cramer effect or wonders why he doesn’t advocate holding more crypto as part of a portfolio. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer shared some of his latest thoughts about crypto: “I’ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world’s lunacy. But for years now, I’ve also been saying Bitcoin’s a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don’t want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer reiterated that there’s more to investing than simply “just owning cryptocurrencies.” In fact, he believes that buying stocks can potentially lead to an investor making more money than buying cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin’s part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history,” believes Cramer. “Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Another Mad Money episode saw him stress that he has held Bitcoin for years as Cramer shared: “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do—not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let’s dispel the idea that I’ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.” To make our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about, we listed down stocks he commented on during at latest episode of CNBC’s Squawk on the Street and tweeted about.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) is the embattled biotechnology company that rose to global fame during the coronavirus pandemic. The firm’s fall from grace is the sharpest example you’ll find of the tough conditions in its industry. Pharma firms spend billions of dollars and years developing drugs. The heavy time and money investment means that their drugs have to generate value for years as well in order to recover costs and create space for developing new treatments. However, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic. It is aggressively investing in R&D, with TTM expenses being $4.8 billion. While investing in growth is good, the spending is just $200 million short of the firm’s revenue. Cramer isn’t too happy with Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) as he shared: “Moderna, I guess is one of the great fizzles I’ve ever seen.” Overall, MRNA ranks 14th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer in a lab coat examining a state-of-the-art semiconductor chip. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), a chip maker for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD, attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. Its advanced microprocessors have fueled business for TSMC immensely, keeping the hopes up of investors, especially after ASML cut down guidance. On October 17, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, Bob O’Donnell, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the position of TSMC. He shared that ASML cutting its guidance has more to do with challenges in China and much less with the semiconductor industry. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid financial performance, emphasizing that the company beat earnings and raised its guidance for 2025, suggesting that TSMC is a “much better bellwether” of AI. Overall, TSMC expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30% due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also plans to spend nearly $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects revenue from AI chips to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s iShares ETF Makes History with Unique Blockchain-Backed Municipal Debt Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-ishares-etf-makes-history-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T18:30:05Z

On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, successfully acquired municipal debt through a transaction that exclusively utilizes blockchain technology. According to a Bloomberg report, this marks the first instance of municipal bonds being purchased, settled, and held entirely on a blockchain platform. Per the report, the bonds were issued earlier this year by the city of Quincy, Massachusetts, and were underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The transaction was facilitated through an application on JPMorgan’s private, permissioned blockchain platform, known as Digital Debt Service. Interestingly, this approach not only streamlines the bond issuance process but also enhances transparency and security in municipal finance. BlackRock’s acquisition was made through its actively-managed exchange-traded fund, the iShares Short Maturity Municipal Bond Active ETF (MEAR). Since its inception in 2015, MEAR has attracted approximately $750 million in client assets. As part of this historic deal, BlackRock has taken a total position of $6.5 million in the Quincy bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pat Haskell, head of BlackRock’s municipal bond group, expressed optimism about the transaction, stating: The use of blockchain throughout the lifecycle of bonds is just one example of the potential for this technology to transform capital markets. This transaction marks a significant moment for the municipal bond market and is a testament to BlackRock’s dedication to innovation. The prospectus for MEAR was recently updated to permit the fund to invest in municipal bonds settled through JPMorgan’s blockchain application, as indicated in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission dated December 17. However, investors are cautioned about potential risks, including lack of liquidity and the possibility of errors or limitations inherent in the underlying computer code of the application. In recent years, several issuers and underwriters have explored the feasibility of blockchain technology in the municipal bond market. Notably, the board of trustees at Michigan State University considered a deal that would have utilized a proprietary digital assets platform developed by Goldman Sachs, highlighting a growing interest in integrating blockchain solutions within traditional finance. In the realm of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock has garnered significant attention, particularly due to ongoing inflows throughout the year. Notably, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has outperformed its gold ETF in terms of assets under management (AUM). According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, it took BlackRock’s gold ETF 20 years to reach $33 billion in AUM. In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF has nearly doubled that figure in less than a year, approaching the $60 billion milestone. This development occurs amid notable volatility in Bitcoin’s price over the past 48 hours, as traders anticipated the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate cuts. During this period, despite Bitcoin briefly falling below the $100,000 mark, BlackRock seized the opportunity to purchase $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, despite losing the key $100,000 milestone, Bitcoin has managed to recover this level and is currently trading at $101,240. However, the market’s leading crypto still posted losses of 2.3% in the 24-hour time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: All 7 Blackstone holiday videos ranked
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-holiday-videos-rankings-explanation
Time Published: 2024-12-19T17:31:45Z
Full Content:
Blackstone released its first satirical holiday video in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the company-wide holiday party, a tradition that was canceled because the firm had grown too large. Now, it's a viral sensation. Eight million people have viewed last year's video featuring Blackstone executives doing their best to match the success of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour with a pop song about alternative investments. It made headlines, with the Daily Mail questioning whether it was "the most cringeworthy corporate video ever." This year, the company doubled down on the singing (and introduced line-dancing) in its most ambitious (and outlandish) holiday video yet. It also featured 200 employees, up from just 20 in 2018, a testiment to the video's popularity within the firm. Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, joked that his role in producing the video has made him a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue. "People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'" Gillespie told Business Insider. "People are really into lobbying to be in it." If you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018. This video came out in December 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom "The Office," but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene one Blackstone executive has a hard time recognizing a colleague with out-of-control long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?) While it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to "I'm Walking on Sunshine," kicking off the tradition of holiday video songs, which have featured prominently since. Still, it's a bit stuck in the pandemic era, hence its place at No. 7. The conceit of this holiday season is fake news station "BX TV News" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.) Schwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos as the sincere elder statesman to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. But then, he notes that there is a secret hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana-Jones-referencing journey to find the scroll with the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video. The video successfully makes a number of self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company has been going with "The Office" theme for four years, hence its ranking. The budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo. The key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives "'Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm." The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, "I make one call to the FCC and they'll cancel this clown car."Employees chant "end it," and celebrate as they think Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. But instead, it's clear that 2022's BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call is still a weekly requirement at the firm. Scranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom "The Office" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like "The Office," there is hand-held camera work and plenty of "candid" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson. This video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic. The 2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of "The Office" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments. This is video that broke into the wider world, spawning more than a few mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series that's main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: "Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock." Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing some glittery fringe top. The 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone' absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence" Gray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads which still show up in holiday videos, and on some people's desks. We agree that that the mascot joke works, hence its ranking. This video also ends with one of the best Steve Schwarzman gags of the series, when it's revealed that Schwarzman has been the mysterious person inside Mr. Stone the whole time. After last year's reception, leaned in to the cringe with a metaverse-like exploration of Blackstone executives as reality television stars that ends in a country song-and-dance routine. It features appearances from famous friends. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which was originally created within Blackstone before spinning out in the 1990s, gets in a joke about how the two firms get confused for each other. An extended "Real Housewives" bit includes some shade from Jenna Lyons, "Real Housewives of New York" star, fashion designer and executive creative director at Fundamental Co, a branding agency spun out of Blackstone last year.The highlight, however, was billionaire founder and CEO Steve Schwarzman playing Kendall Jenner attempting to cut a cucumber, which has to be one of the most mind-bending images ever put on screen. (We are still struggling to fully process it.) Gray told BI that the turn to country was inspired by Beyonce's own embrace of the genre this year on "Cowboy Carter", which came in the wake of her 2016 snub by the Country Music Awards. And just like Beyonce, some of the firm's best work comes when they don't let the critics stop them. Jump to

Title: Health Insurance Execs Should Live in Fear of Prison, Not Murder
URL: https://theintercept.com/2024/12/19/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-insurance/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The U.S. political system is owned by corporations despised by the American people. Luigi Mangione is the result. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is a profoundly revealing moment in American politics. Not only has it opened the floodgates of public anger at health insurance companies, but it has also demonstrated just how avoidant most U.S. politicians are when it comes to acknowledging that anger or doing anything about it. The surge of online excitement surrounding the man accused of murdering Thompson, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, is a symptom of a much larger problem: an oligarchic U.S. political system that repeatedly fails to respond to the needs of the people. In the absence of effective government, vigilante violence becomes much more likely. Mangione has found popularity precisely because the man he is accused of killing ran a company that routinely boosted profits by pushing its customers closer to illness and death. Earlier this year, a U.S. Senate committee investigated UnitedHealthcare and determined that the insurance company frequently denied nursing care to patients who were recovering from falls and strokes in order to boost its profits. Health news platform Stat reported that a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary called NaviHealth systematically denied care for seriously ill seniors. Thompson himself was facing a class-action lawsuit for insider trading amid a Department of Justice investigation. Of course, it is easy to treat UnitedHealthcare’s abuses as the actions of just one evil company run by a handful of bad men. But these companies are owned by Wall Street. Institutional investors and shareholders reward and punish corporate executives based on the profits they generate and the share prices they produce. In causing harm to so many Americans, Thompson was meeting the demands of his corporate board members and the even wealthier interests that they serve. These profits generated by denying Americans medical care are in turn converted into campaign contributions and lobbying dollars that block our political system from doing anything about it. In 2023 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s political action committee reported donating $2.95 million to federal campaigns and spending $16.62 million on lobbying expenses. Meanwhile, the top federal recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group executives and employees was Kamala Harris. Perhaps this is why Harris flip-flopped on abolishing private health insurance during her first of two failed runs for president: she knew just how much money was on the table. Harris, of course, isn’t the only major recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group employees in 2024. The Democratic National Committee received $103,022; the Republican National Committee received $207,125; and the Trump campaign took in $144,297. And UnitedHealth Group is not alone. A quick review of other major health insurance companies demonstrates that each of them has spent heavily in recent campaign cycles to maintain a political system that responds to their corporate interests, while undermining the health of the American people. Perhaps this is why prominent Democratic politicians like Pennsylvania’s Sen. John Fetterman and Gov. Josh Shapiro were so quick to condemn the murder of Thompson, while saying little or nothing about the thousands of people who have been denied coverage for their medical care by UnitedHealthcare under Thompson’s management. And perhaps this has something to do with why New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a statement regarding the murder of Thompson and personally joined a virtual convening of some 175 corporate representatives who were concerned about their safety, but has said nothing regarding the insurance abuses of UnitedHealthcare. With Republicans about to control all three branches of the U.S. government, any real accountability for health insurance companies, including criminalization of their abuses, is highly unlikely. But even under the best of circumstances, we shouldn’t expect much from our status quo political system. The high-water mark of health care reform in recent American history was the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare.” Obama’s signature achievement was originally a conservative Heritage Foundation plan previously implemented by former private equity executive Mitt Romney when he was the governor of Massachusetts. And even this market-friendly approach was later disavowed and attacked by Republicans. But despite these tremendous hurdles — or because of them — a clear public rage exists that would be foolish to ignore. For progressives seeking to reboot the Democratic Party, this is the time to turn public outrage at UnitedHealthcare into tangible pressure that breaks the back of business-as-usual. It is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. In evaluating the present moment, it is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. The hysterias over the so-called war on Christmas, transgender access to bathrooms, critical race theory, “all lives matter,” and “they’re eating the cats” are all examples of moments when conservatives have created controversies or flipped the script on real-world events to shift headlines and distract the public from the actual problems of concentrated power and wealth in America. Republicans have long been better at this than Democrats, because Republicans use their meme wars to punch down and target the powerless, while Democrats are usually too fearful to punch up and target the corporate elites who fund their campaigns while driving many of America’s ills. But unlike many Republican attacks, the problems with health insurance are real, and public concern is quite broad. A recent Economist/YouGov poll revealed that 62 percent of those polled blamed health insurance companies for problems with the health care system, and the same percentage blame corporate executives. Democrats would be foolish to let the public’s focus on UnitedHealthcare dissipate, but as the 2024 elections revealed, Democratic Party leaders have a long track record of such foolishness. Given that Republicans will soon hold a trifecta in Washington, and that many Democrats are too fearful of their paymasters to bluntly criticize the corporate classes, how can we push our political system to hold health insurers and Wall Street accountable? One answer might be found in abandoning any hope of seeking immediate redress through our legislative process. Instead we should treat health insurance companies, their dominant shareholders, and the politicians who serve them in the same way that one would treat a repressive government that one is trying to reform — or overthrow. In this context, our tools of battle become cultural delegitimization, demand radicalization, economic pressure, and (nonviolent) political war. Our goal should be to build an American political culture in which health insurance executives and their companies are viewed and treated the same way that child molesters and drug cartels are. They should be ostracized, stigmatized, and demonized. By doing so, we will shift American politics and create a more hospitable environment for pursuing the long-term accountability that health care reformers seek. This cultural delegitimization can be accomplished through a series of campaigns that target health insurance executives, demonize employment in their businesses, and create a broader negative environment in which no one wants to be associated with them. When it comes to finding opportunities to stigmatize these individuals and corporations, there are likely to be many opportunities to choose from. One recent example? Even as Thompson and UnitedHealthcare were denying sectors of the public access to valuable medical coverage, they were allowed to “sportswash” their reputations by serving as sponsors of the 2026 Special Olympics USA Games. The next time a philanthropic or community initiative unrolls a red carpet for a health insurance executive, there should be a dramatic public backlash. We must shift the Overton window far enough that legislative reforms and accountability become the moderate position in American politics. This means speaking bluntly and directly about what should happen to predatory health insurance executives, their corporations, and their enablers. Health insurance CEOs who implement denial of coverage practices to boost profits should go to jail. Health insurance companies that enable this behavior should face revocation of their corporate charters. And shareholders and investors who financially benefit from these ugly profits should be made directly and criminally liable. Finally, the thousands upon thousands of people who have been unjustly denied coverage for their medical services should be introduced to a new concept: reparations. Every entity that profits from predatory health insurance practices should be made to face economic costs. Corporate accountability campaigners and health insurance exchange experts should put their heads together to determine the best ways to undermine abusive health insurance companies’ access to new customers and policy holders. In addition, investors in UnitedHealth Group and other abusive health insurers should face direct pressure to divest from these companies. Investment funds, retirement funds, university endowments, and other major investment players should all be pushed to take their money elsewhere. As documented by Derek Seidman in Truthout, the top two shareholders of UnitedHealthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group “are the world’s two biggest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard,” which oversee a combined total of over $20 trillion in assets. Not only that, but BlackRock and Vanguard are also the top two shareholders of each of the top four U.S. health insurers. Both investment firms should face public demands to stop building their wealth off of the suffering of the thousands of people denied coverage for their medical needs. Finally, the days of prominent politicians taking money from UnitedHealth Group must come to an end. It’s not hard to imagine a large number of senior citizens signing on to a demand that politicians should not take money from health insurance companies that are denying older Americans health care coverage. With elections for the next Democratic National Committee chair coming up in February 2025, now is the time to push the DNC to stop taking money from UnitedHealth Group and other major health insurers. Politicians who stay silent on these demands and who refuse to bluntly criticize health insurance executives and companies should face electoral boycotts in which voters commit to voting against them. In a fairer world, Brian Thompson wouldn’t have been murdered. He would already have been put behind bars. Health insurance executives profiting off of human suffering should live in fear. But what they should fear is jail, not murder. We don’t want to live in a society where private individuals become judges, juries, and street executioners based simply on their own determinations of morality or crime. That is the world in which anti-abortion activists kill doctors and nurses. It is the world where white supremacist gunmen assume Black community members are “criminals” to be executed. In the space between illegal vigilante violence and deference to a broken political system is a vast opportunity for constructive and sustained political disruption that eliminates the “safe space” for business executives who profit from the destruction of human life. One can easily condemn the murder of Thompson while simultaneously condemning who Thompson was and what UnitedHealthcare is known to have done. Denying countless people access to the medical coverage they needed has caused significant pain and suffering, and may have even caused many unnecessary and early deaths. That it took a murder of a health insurance CEO for us to be talking about this reveals just how broken our political, legal, and media systems are. Health insurance executives, investors, and the politicians who they purchase should all fear social ostracism, financial collapse, and political defeat. This is entirely possible if the political rage of the American public is combined with a strategic road map that turns that anger into action. The fundamental question is whether or not progressive leaders and health care reformers have the courage to turn this moment into something of lasting significance.

Title: Is it too late to buy bitcoin? Why some Wall Street experts say no — and 4 ways to start investing now.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-price-start-investing-wall-street-trump-2024-12

If you go by some of the many cautionary investing adages — like "buy low, sell high" or Warren Buffett's "be fearful when others are greedy" — it may be tough to argue that bitcoin is a good buy right now. The days when bitcoin traded at mere fractions of a cent are long gone. The cryptocurrency's price is anything but low, at least relative to what it was, especially after a 55% rally to over $108,000 following Donald Trump's reelection. But some market experts are taking the opposite philosophy with bitcoin and believe it's a fine time to buy, thanks to favorable fundamental trends. "We believe it is the period leading up to large-scale adoption where the biggest future return potential could lie," Samara Cohen, the chief investment officer of ETFs and index investments at BlackRock, wrote about bitcoin in a recent note. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth, shares this view. "We're basically in the beginning, even though $100,000 seems like a high number," he told BI. He recommends investors allocate about 1% to 10% of their portfolios to crypto, depending on risk tolerance. Cannon has seen inklings that other governments, such as Argentina, could adopt bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, sending the cryptocurrency's price even higher. "You want to get there before the big money is there," Cannon said. In other words, don't sit out on the bitcoin rally just because you think the ship has already sailed. Bill Miller IV, the chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Miller Value Funds, likens bitcoin to "digital gold" due to its scarce and decentralized nature. But the recent overwhelming interest in bitcoin is hardly a guarantee of its success. It's famously volatile and prone to dramatic price drops — hence why bitcoin bulls like BlackRock recommend exercising discretion and educating yourself on the risks when investing. But as institutional investors continue to pile in and talks about establishing a national bitcoin reserve swirl in Washington, it's increasingly apparent that the asset is being legitimized in the investing landscape. Luckily for investors, there's never been a more convenient time to be bitcoin-curious. As the cryptocurrency has gained steam in the past few years, mainstream brokerage firms have picked it up. You can purchase bitcoin directly through some online brokerages such as Fidelity, Robinhood, and Interactive Brokers. For those without $100,000 to drop on a bitcoin, these exchanges offer the opportunity to purchase fractional shares. However, others, like Charles Schwab and E-Trade, don't provide that option. If you want to hold bitcoin directly but can't buy it through your traditional brokerage account, fear not. There are several centralized crypto exchanges that provide a platform for buying and selling bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. Some bitcoin purists prefer buying on a decentralized exchange, similar to how some gold investors prefer buying bullion. "If you own bitcoin on a centralized entity, you force someone else to buy it on your behalf, but you don't actually hold the bitcoin," Miller said. Decentralized exchanges facilitate peer-to-peer trading without a broker, adding an extra layer of privacy and security. However, a decentralized exchange isn't the most beginner-friendly way to invest, as they have complex fee structures and don't permit exchanges between fiat and crypto. The first spot-bitcoin ETF debuted in the US in January 2024. A spot ETF provides investors with an accessible way of gaining exposure to bitcoin on a fully regulated traditional exchange. The funds hold bitcoins in a secure digital vault managed by registered custodians and issue shares to correspond with the number of bitcoins held. Bitcoin futures ETFs, which hold bitcoin futures contracts instead of actual bitcoins, are another investment vehicle. However, because they hold financial derivatives, these ETFs might not follow the price of bitcoin as closely as a spot ETF and can experience increased volatility due to the risks associated with futures contracts. Bitcoin ETFs are Cannon's go-to recommendation for new investors in the crypto space, as investors don't have to worry about directly holding bitcoin in a cryptocurrency wallet: "It's just like if they bought a stock," he said. He likes BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in particular. Other examples of bitcoin ETFs include the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Similar to how central banks stockpile gold, some of the market's biggest companies are building up their bitcoin reserves, even if their business operations have nothing to do with bitcoin. John Haar, the managing director of the bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, has seen investors increasing their bitcoin allocation indirectly by buying these companies' stocks. The business intelligence company Microstrategy (MSTR) is the most notable example in the market right now. Other companies adding bitcoin to their balance sheets include the biotech company Semler Scientific (SMLR) and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet (MTPLF), Haar said. Investors can also get bitcoin exposure by going straight to the source and buying stock in bitcoin-mining companies, Haar added. As a decentralized asset, bitcoin depends on a network of users to keep a record of transactions and verify new ones. Bitcoin miners use crypto software and hardware to solve complex puzzles and confirm the addition of blocks to the public ledger. Haar pointed to two examples: Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Mara Holdings (MARA). These companies operate data centers to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and provide auxiliary cryptocurrency services.

Title: Homelessness in NZ: The Christmas reality is there’s no room at the inn for Kiwis needing help

Full Content:
Rotorua homeless couple Elaine Sawyer and Anaru Hauiti have been sleeping rough this year. Photo / Andrew Warner THREE KEY FACTS Central to the Christmas message is that everyone needs a home – an article of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet as Christmas approaches this year, the coalition Government has announced that to meet their target for reducing Emergency Housing Special Needs Grants, the number of people in emergency housing will be reduced. Also, the availability of transitional housing will possibly be cut. It’s hard for anyone to know the number of people and families affected for sure, because they aren’t collected or reported. Moreover, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), which manages the public housing waiting list and the Emergency Housing Special Need Grants, are placing barriers in the way of those who are urgently seeking housing. There are credible reports that to verify applicants seeking housing because they are victims of domestic violence, staff at MSD Community are encouraged to phone the abusive partner to confirm that their partner did not contribute to the violence. Community advocates report that the criteria for state housing help are becoming less and less transparent and people are increasingly having to reapply. Community providers are increasingly having to turn away applicants, who are desperate for sustainable housing, but not counted in formal statistics as in need of housing. Meanwhile the Government does not have an alternative housing policy and keeps no record of housing need. There is no plan for providing alternative state or community housing elsewhere, at the scale required. Despite its record of significantly upscaling the building of high-quality housing in sustainable communities, Kāinga Ora - Homes and Communities has been denied any further capital funding. It has been directed not to do any further developments, and to restrict its scope to being a landlord only. To the dismay of community housing providers, Housing Minister Chris Bishop made it clear at the recent Community Housing Aotearoa Conference that the Government is not going to underwrite most community housing providers to build more community housing. Their capital in most cases will need to come from private equity, perhaps overseas investors like BlackRock, which has summarily liquidated SolarZero, despite receiving a large capital injection from Government. Frontline community staff are now increasingly having to help people – both adults and children – who are homeless and living in cars, or on the streets. Homeless numbers have increased, as the recently released Severe Housing Deprivation Study, based on the 2023 Census, showed. By contrast, in a recent evaluation of The Housing First policy, it was shown to be the most effective way to help people back into stable housing. It enables them to re-enter employment, and for their children to be registered with a GP and immunised, prosper at school, keep well, and turn up less frequently at accident and emergency departments. Most dispiritingly, we have seen this cycle before: we know what the outcomes will be. When Sir Bill English was the Minister for Housing New Zealand Corporation, the precursor of Kāinga Ora from 2014-2016, he called himself “the largest slum landlord in New Zealand”. Between 2013/14 and 2016/17 the Minister began the sale of state housing, which led to about a 5000 fall in the number of state houses, without any serious consideration of the consequences. Unsurprisingly, this led to a major increase in homelessness. He established Emergency Housing, which mainly used temporary accommodation to house the growing numbers of people left homeless as a direct result of the lack of new public houses. For all too many people — children, adults, single people and families — this Christmas there is still “no room at the inn”. The woman had kids in the car when she ploughed into the back of Raymond Mathews.

Title: Blackstone embraces country music and reality TV in its most ambitious holiday video yet. Watch it here.

Blackstone on Thursday launched its most ambitious holiday video yet on Thursday, featuring 200 employees, two cameos, and a country music song-and-line-dance routine. The video series, which has become must-see TV for Wall Street, is in its seventh year. Last year's version attracted widespread attention, resulting in 8 million views across various platforms, the company said. The videos seek to poke fun at the people behind Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, while also touting its investment prowess. This year's video ditched its usual framing around NBC's hit sitcom "The Office" in favor of reality-TV parodies and included a brief appearance by the "Real Housewives of New York" star and fashion designer Jenna Lyons. Some of Blackstone's portfolio companies, including Supergoop and Jersey Mike's, also got airtime. It kicks off with a recap of last year's video, which depicted Jon Gray, Blackstone's president and chief operating officer, compelling the firm's executives to go on tour like Taylor Swift. In a "Behind the Music"-type parody, the executives lament the poor reception they received for their "cringeworthy" song titled "The Alternatives Era." "People just stopped talking to me," Jon Korngold, the global cohead of technology investing and head of Blackstone growth, said. "CEOs, LPs, even my mom." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink makes an appearance to turn his nose up at the company. "Can you believe people confuse us with them," Fink says. The story takes a turn when Christine Anderson, the head of corporate affairs at Blackstone and one of the masterminds of the firm's holiday video tradition, decides that the next logical step is reality TV. The video, a metatextual reference to its own popularity, then hits overdrive with a series of reality television spoofs, from the "Real Housewives" to "The Bachelor." "I'm private equity's biggest asset," Joe Baratta, the head of private equity, says in a braggadocious manner while being introduced in the faux series, "The Real Executives of Park Avenue." Even the firm's international offices get in on the act with the London office starring in "Love Island Blackstone" and the Tokyo team competing in the infamous "Human Tetris" game-show stunt. Back at 345 Park Avenue, Gray's executive assistant, Laurie Carlson, throws a martini into the face of Joe Lohrer, the head of US retail sales for Blackstone's private wealth group. "Sorry, Joe, they wanted me to do something dramatic," Carlson says. The head of Blackstone's video team, Jay Gillespie, makes an appearance as a reality-television producer and calls for another martini to try the shot again. Perhaps the funniest bit is Schwarzman's appearance in a parody of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," in which he is filmed awkwardly cutting a cucumber à la Kendall Jenner. Back in the conference room, Gray tells the firm that they're going down the wrong path. A running gag in the series is that no one wants to go along with Gray's hare-brained ideas and it seems like he's finally come to his senses. Instead, he proposes another zany idea. "Blackstone needs to go country," Gray says. The video is capped off by the firm's second original song as executives sing and dance around the office, in Midtown traffic, and on the back of a mechanical bull. The song's chorus, lip-synced by Schwarzman in the video, is "You can build. You can build with Blackstone," a reference to the firm's first television ad, which was released earlier this year.

The bitcoin price has doubled since its August lows, riding a wave of interest that's been fueled by Donald Trump's U.S. election victory and U.S. dollar collapse warnings from Tesla billionaire Elon Musk.

In the BlackRock video, given a boost when it was shared by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor, bitcoin was described as having a fixed supply of 21 million—"this hard-coded rule controls supply, purchasing power and helps avoid the potential misuse of printing more and more currency." However, a disclaimer appeared alongside the description, adding: "There is no guarantee that bitcoin's 21 million supply cap will not be changed"—something that undermines bitcoin's growing reputation as a scarce digital asset comparable to gold. BlackRock's admission that bitcoin's supply cap could be changed has been taken by some as confirmation BlackRock's adoption of bitcoin will lead to it being "hijacked." "They're getting everyone used to this eventuality," Joel Valenzuela, business development lead for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of the cryptocurrency dash, posted to X. "When the supply cap increase happens, it will have 'always been part of the plan.' And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say bitcoin wasn't hijacked." Bitcoin's supply is fixed at around 21 million, though the last bitcoin aren't expected to be created—via a process known as mining—until around the year 2140, over a century from now. The number of bitcoin that can be issued is part of bitcoin's code and it would require agreement among those that secure the bitcoin network in return for newly minted bitcoin, known as miners, to change that. If a majority of miners did vote to increase the supply of bitcoin, the network would split, or fork, and the minority would continue to direct their computing power toward the network that is capped at around 21 million bitcoin.

Title: Stocks tanked after the Fed signaled fewer rate cuts next year. Here's what analysts are saying.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-fed-interest-rates-analyst-reaction-wall-street-stocks-2024-12

Full Content:
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, bringing its decline since mid-September to 100 basis points. Wall Street usually celebrates rate cuts as lowering borrowing costs drives spending, investing, and hiring. Reducing rates also signals inflation is under control and makes risk assets like stocks relatively more attractive by trimming yields on safer assets like Treasurys. Yet stocks tanked because Fed officials projected two cuts next year, down from four previously. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones declined nearly 3%, while the Nasdaq 100 dipped nearly 4% after the meeting. The sharp drop fueled a 74% surge in VIX, better known as the stock market's fear gauge. It was its second-largest one-day jump in history. But while many market pros still urge caution amid fewer rate cuts in 2025, a number of analysts across Wall Street see Wednesday's sell-off as a "buy the dip" opportunity, with the intense reaction to the Fed meeting unlikely to derail this year's "Santa Claus" rally. Here's what investors and analysts are saying after Wednesday's brutal sell-off. Investors were "overreacting" because they knew going into the meeting that the Fed was likely to signal a pause in rate cuts, Schleif said. On top of that, the economy remains strong, which is what matters the most, she added. "Markets seemed to ignore the number of times and ways that Chair Powell noted how strong the economy is," Schleif said. "The slower pace of Fed cuts is for a good reason, which is that the economy is strong, and a strong economy is ultimately what matters most for stocks and earnings." Economists at Citi said the Fed's hawkish pivot probably wouldn't last and instead turn dovish once the labor market showed signs of weakening. With just 50 basis points of interest-rate cuts priced into the market between now and mid-2026, Hollenhorst isn't buying it. "The continued softening of the labor market is likely to become even more evident in coming months, keeping the Fed cutting at a faster pace than markets are pricing," Hollenhorst said in a note on Wednesday. "We expect a sharp dovish pivot from Powell and the committee in the next few months." Ives said the Fed's interest-rate path is not what will be the driving force for tech stocks over the next few years. "Ultimately it does not move the needle for a soft landing and bullish backdrop for risk-on assets," Ives said in a note to clients. Instead, Ives told his clients to stay laser-focused on the two biggest catalysts for tech heading into 2025: the continued development and adoption of AI and a friendlier regulatory environment that should pave the way for more mergers and acquisitions. "US markets played the part of Scrooge on Wednesday, tumbling as the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone dampened holiday cheer. "Investors should see this as a healthy spot of profit-taking rather than an end to the party, after what's been a fantastic run for markets since the US election." "This is a Fed that really has no faith in its view at any time and is willingly reactive as opposed to proactive even though its actions affect the economy with long lags. "You would have thought that between the commentary and forecast changes that the world has changed dramatically since the jumbo rate cut just three months ago. It clearly does not take much to cause this Fed to swing its view around. I can guarantee that it will shift again." "'We had a year-end inflation forecast, and it's kind of fallen apart.' "Not exactly the confidence-inspiring line you'd expect from a Fed chair. But Jerome Powell's performance at yesterday's press conference wasn't his finest hour. In what might have been the most uncomfortable showing of his tenure, Powell ceded the stage to the hawks, visibly strained as he tried to sell a strategy he didn't fully appear to endorse. "Powell flagged inflation 'moving sideways' and 'higher uncertainty' around its trajectory. These admissions reveal a central bank increasingly unsure of its footing, with rates markets now expecting just one cut for 2025 (as we do), and with no real consensus on when that final cut would arrive." "Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves. The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected — this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year. "The good news is that this 10-day sell-off should lay the path for a Santa Rally leading into next week." "Santa came early and dropped a 25-bps rate cut in the market's stocking but accompanied it with a note saying that there would be coal next year. "The market is forward-looking and ignored the good news of today's rate cut and instead focused on the paucity of rate cuts for next year." "What was heard last night from the Fed as an accompaniment to the interest rate cut is a showstopper for the stock market. "The Fed is sending a clear signal that it has almost completed the phase of interest rate cuts. The year 2025 will be a significant break in the Fed's rate-cutting cycle. "The Trump blessing could quickly turn into a curse. If the market expects yields to rise further, it is unlikely that the Fed will intervene against these forces. If inflation data continues to rise in January and February, then that could be it for the interest rate cuts." "While the Fed is taking all the heat for today's sell-off, a reality check from overbought conditions, deteriorating market breadth, and rising rates was arguably overdue. "Overall, today's FOMC meeting brought back some unwanted clouds of uncertainty over monetary policy next year. At a minimum, market expectations have shifted toward a shallower- and slower-than-anticipated rate-cutting cycle. Technically, the near-term risk remains to the upside for 10-year Treasury yields, creating a likely headwind for stocks." "The Fed has poured cold water on already dwindling market hopes for generous rate cuts in 2025. "Given the risk of resurging inflation from potential trade tariffs and a slowdown in immigration that has been cooling pressure in the labor market, market expectations of only two more cuts in 2025 now seem reasonable. "We expected this policy outcome, so it doesn't change our recently upgraded view on US equities. US stocks can still benefit from AI and other mega forces, from robust economic growth and from broad earnings growth — and we see them outperforming international peers in 2025." "With an economy that's going gangbusters and an incoming president with a fiscally loose agenda, you wonder why the Fed felt it necessary to cut. "Is this to curry favor with the incoming administration or is there a bump in the road the Fed can see that the rest of us are missing." "The FOMC delivered about as hawkish a cut as they could muster up yesterday, and market participants were not particularly pleased about what they heard. "It was, though, a little perplexing to see such a violent market reaction to Powell's remarks, particularly considering how 'every man and his dog' had been expecting this sort of a pivot in the run up to the meeting. "It feels, though, as if markets have overreacted to Powell's message, and that we may have reached something of a hawkish extreme here. "Consequently, I'd be a dip buyer of equities here, as strong earnings and economic growth should see the path of least resistance continuing to lead to the upside, offsetting the fading impact of the 'Fed Put.'"

Full Content:
In 2009, Forbes ranked the Wealthiest Black Americans and the only billionaire on the list was Oprah Winfrey, then worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Among the 20 entrepreneurs, moguls, athletes and entertainers on that inaugural ranking was Robert Johnson, the cofounder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), then worth $550 million, Michael Jordan (then worth an estimated $525 million), Magic Johnson ($500 million) and Shaquille O’Neal ($130 million). Motown Records founder and music business icon Berry Gordy, 95, made the list with a fortune then estimated at $325 million as well as Bill Cosby (with a net worth of $450 million) and Ken Chenault, the first (and only) Black CEO of American Express, who was worth $125 million. The Wealthiest Black Americans list was powerful. It was intended to keep track of success in Black America and over the years, Forbes has remained committed to celebrating the achievements of Black entrepreneurs. In 2023, when Forbes launched the ForbesBLK platform, creating a new list of the wealthiest Black Americans was one of its main objectives—but net worth isn’t the only way to keep score of impact and influence in the community and world at large. The inaugural ForbesBLK 50 list accomplishes this mission, combining some of the richest Black Americans with pioneering entrepreneurs, activists and innovators. Many of the names from 2009 still appear on the 2024 list—including Oprah, MJ and Magic. The BLK 50 also celebrates new wealth creators such as Fawn Weaver, the founder and CEO of Uncle Nearest, an estimated $1.1 billion whiskey brand and the largest Black-owned spirits company in the country. It also honors individuals in the financial sector and clean energy, as well as top executives ranging from the CEO of a nuclear energy company to celebrities winning in business. As part of the list, ForbesBLK also curated a three-part video series about how to build wealth in three sectors: Real Estate, featuring Don Peebles, founder and CEO of the Peebles Corporation; Sustainability, with Josh Aviv, founder and CEO of mobile EV charging startup SparkCharge; and investing, with wisdom from Tracy Maitland, founder and president of Advent Capital Management. Introducing the inaugural class of the ForbesBLK 50: taylor hill/getty images Abbey is cofounder and co-CEO of Esusu, a New York fintech startup that helps renters build their credit histories and scores by reporting rent payments to credit bureaus. More than 20,000 properties currently offer Esusu’s service and some 1.8 million Americans have used Esusu to record a rent payment. The startup also recently launched a direct-to-consumer product, MyEsusu, through which consumers can build credit and monitor their credit scores. In early 2022, Esusu raised $130 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation. Before founding Esusu, Abbey, who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, worked as a mergers and acquisitions consultant at PWC and cofounded a non-profit and a data analytics startup. Forbes Born in Saudi Arabia to Sudanese parents, Abuzeid studied to be a doctor at University College London before moving to the United States to become a healthcare consultant. In 2017, Abuzeid cofounded the healthcare hiring platform Incredible Health, which private investors valued at $1.65 billion in 2022. That propelled Abuzeid onto a small list of Black female founders of companies worth more than $1 billion. With an estimated net worth of $350 million based on her stake in Incredible Health, she also ranks among the top 100 Self-Made Women in America on Forbes’ 2024 list. al drago/bloomberg From his dorm room at Syracuse University, Aviv founded SparkCharge, a mobile electric vehicle charger designed to eliminate “range anxiety” —or the fear EV drivers have about getting stranded because the country isn't fully prepared to charge electric cars. SparkCharge raised $59 million from investors since 2017, according to PitchBook. Additionally, in 2020, it received a $1 million investment from billionaire Mark Cuban after appearing on Shark Tank. jamel toppin for forbes Awotona is the founder and CEO of the scheduling software startup Calendly, which private investors valued at $3 billion in 2021. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Awotona moved to Atlanta when he was 15, and studied computer science at the University of Georgia before switching majors to business and management information. After working as a salesman for several tech firms and launching a few failed startups, Awotona cashed in his 401(k) in 2013 to found Calendly because he was frustrated with the number of emails it required to schedule meetings. After bootstrapping the company for several years, in 2021 Awotona raised $350 million to further scale Calendly. Today, he is worth an estimated $1.4 billion. Forbes Bradley is the founder and managing partner of 1863 Ventures, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit business accelerator and venture capital fund focusing on women and people of color. In 2022, Bradley’s impact landed her on the Forbes 50 Over 50 list. A graduate of Georgetown, she worked as a regulator for Black banks in the Obama Administration. In 2016, she led a summit to discover 500 Black entrepreneurs in the Washington, D.C. area, which led to the formation of 1863 Ventures. By funding a new generation of entrepreneurs, and scaling their businesses, Bradley has a goal of unlocking $100 billion in wealth creation in the Black community by 2030. jamel toppin for forbes Drafted in 1975 by the Los Angeles Lakers, then traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bridgeman was one of the most successful NBA sixth men. Throughout his 12-year career, his top salary was $350,000, but after retiring in 1987 he made smart investments, acquiring more than 450 fast-food franchises, including Wendy’s, Chili’s, and Pizza Hut, before acquiring a Coca-Cola bottling company in 2016 and selling nearly half of his restaurant holdings. In September, Bridgeman’s story came full circle when he acquired a 10% stake in the Bucks, a team that Forbes estimates is worth $3.7 billion (net of debt). Forbes Brown is the founder and chairman of Brown Capital Management, one of the nation’s oldest Black-owned investment firms with $8.8 billion in assets under management. Known as Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price’s first Black portfolio manager, Brown grew up in the Jim Crow South and was raised by his grandparents in a home without indoor plumbing and electricity. In 1955, he moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania with his mother.

Brown and his wife, Sylvia, estimate that they have donated more than $55 million to philanthropic causes throughout Baltimore. Forbes Bryant is the CEO of Atlanta-based nonprofit Operation HOPE, which helps make capitalism work for underserved communities. Raised in Los Angeles by a single mother, Bryant founded Operation HOPE in 1992 with financial literacy as its core mission. Since its inception, Operation HOPE estimates it has stimulated and directed more than $4 billion of economic activity into disadvantaged communities. In 2020, Bryant also secured a $130 million commitment from e-commerce company Shopify to help launch one million Black Businesses by 2030. To date, Operation HOPE estimates that more than 350,000 businesses have been launched through the program. jamel toppin for forbes In 2022, Butler was named the first Black president and CEO of Exelon, the nation’s largest utility company, serving more than 10 million customers in Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and beyond.

After a career in television, she taught herself the restaurant business using the internet and, in 2014, opened her first restaurant—a Jamaican eatery in Harlem that caught fire after two years and eventually closed. However, two years later, Cole remerged and started Slutty Vegan from her apartment in Atlanta. Slutty Vegan now has 12 franchises throughout the country. Forbes Cravins is the head of government affairs for The Williams Companies (TWC), an Oklahoma-based energy company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Forbes A civil rights attorney and the former president of the Human Rights Campaign, David gained national recognition while serving as co-counsel to the Atlanta-based Fearless Fund when it was fighting a lawsuit that sought to end its Strivers Grant, which supported Black women who own businesses. He is now the CEO of the Global Black Economic Forum, an organization that convenes business leaders, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and activists to advance economic strategies for Black Americans. Forbes In 1991 Dennis partnered with a college roommate and his mother to start Sundial Brands, a hair and skincare company. The brand eventually sold to Unilever in 2017 for an estimated $1.6 billion. Following the deal, Dennis founded the New Voices Fund, with a $50 million investment from Unilever and the goal of scaling the fund to $100 million to empower entrepreneurs, especially women of color. Sundial’s brands include SheaMoisture, Nubian Heritage, and Madam C.J.

His biggest move of all: cofounding headphone giant Beats Electronics in 2006 and selling it to Apple in 2014 for some $3 billion in cash and stock. Forbes estimates Dr. Dre has a net worth of $850 million. Forbes In 2021, when Thasunda Brown Duckett took the helm of TIAA, the New York-based retirement services giant with nearly $1.3 trillion in assets under management (AUM), she became the company’s first female chief executive in its 106-year history—and one of only two Black female CEOs leading one of the world’s 500 largest companies by revenue. Raised in Arlington, Texas, Duckett’s father worked as a driver for Xerox, and her mother was a teacher. She earned her degree in finance and marketing from the University of Houston and her M.B.A. from Baylor’s Hankamer School of Business. From there, she served as Director of Emerging Markets for Fannie Mae and CEO for Chase Consumer Banking, before arriving at TIAA, where she has been vocal about her efforts to erase the racial retirement savings gap.

Ariel founder John W. Rogers, Jr. hired her right out of Princeton, putting Hobson on notice that he planned to make her firm president by the time she was 30. Today, Forbes estimates that Hobson is worth $150 million, mostly thanks to her nearly 40% stake in Ariel. A longtime advocate for financial literacy, Hobson also sits on the boards of Starbucks and JPMorgan Chase. In 2020, Hobson and her husband, Star Wars creator George Lucas, donated an undisclosed sum to establish a new residential college at Princeton.

Forbes In 1978, with only $1,500 to her name, Janice Bryant Howroyd founded what would become a $1.1 billion (estimated revenue) temporary staffing agency, the ActOne Group. Howroyd grew up in the segregated South in Tarboro, North Carolina, one of 11 siblings. She experienced her first memorable battle with racism when a high school history teacher taught that Black people were suited for slavery. The experience fueled Howroyd’s entrepreneurial journey. Today, ActOne has more than 2,600 employees and operates in 33 countries. Forbes estimates that Howroyd, who ranked No. 51 on the 2024 Forbes Self-Made Women list, has a net worth of $675 million. derek white/getty images Born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1947, when there were no Black-owned radios in the state and few Black DJs across the nation, Hughes set her sights on a career in radio after her mother, a professional musician, gave her a transistor radio as a girl.

He has also bought and sold ownership stakes in the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets franchise and, in 2014, purchased Armand de Brignac Champagne. By 2019, Jay-Z became a billionaire, the first hip-hop artist to reach that milestone. In 2021, his fortune grew after selling a 50% stake in Armand de Brignac to luxury conglomerate LVMH. Forbes estimates he now has a net worth of $2.5 billion. fernando leon/getty images Born in Michigan, Johnson is considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time, having won five NBA titles and three MVP awards in a career that was cut short in 1991 when he was diagnosed with HIV.

Today, long after fighting to launch his career and being “poor as hell,” as he told Forbes in 2020, Perry has built a platform as the second highest-paid TV showrunner and he achieved billionaire status in 2020. Most of his wealth comes from his ownership of the content he has created, which he considers “non-negotiable.” He also owns a quarter of the streaming platform BET+ and a 330-acre studio in Atlanta where most of his movies and TV shows are filmed. jamel toppin for forbes Pompey is the highest-ranking Black person at Goldman Sachs, overseeing the bank’s annual $2 billion investments in philanthropic and community initiatives as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. Among its initiatives is One Million Black Women, a $10 billion investment aimed at driving economic opportunity for a million Black women by 2030. Born in Guyana, Pompey moved to Brooklyn, New York at age 10, and credits her parents—her father was a schoolteacher, and her mother an accounts clerk—for imbuing her with grit and resilience. “I remember my dad used to tell me, ‘You’re as good as, or better, than anyone else in that room,’” Pompey tells Forbes. As a senior in high school, she won a debate contest that awarded a scholarship and summer job working at the former Chemical Bank in New York. In 1994, she graduated from Swarthmore and then earned a law degree from Columbia. In 2006, Pompey joined Goldman Sachs and was named managing director and was a partner by 2018.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dogs of the Dow Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend-focused investors are often drawn to stocks with high yields, shaping their strategies around acquiring such investments. A notable approach is the Dogs of the Dow (DOD) strategy, which involves selecting the 10 highest dividend-yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each year. This method operates on the belief that these so-called "Dogs" are either undervalued or out of favor. By targeting these stocks, investors hope to benefit from potential price appreciation while also securing a steady stream of dividend income. The strategy is based on the idea that these high-yield stocks are merely temporarily undervalued and are likely to recover shortly. Numerous financial experts have provided detailed explanations of the strategy to help investors develop a thorough understanding of it. Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at the Heider College of Business at Creighton University, spoke about the Dogs in one of his interviews with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst: “The underlying premise behind the strategy is mean reversion. The [Dogs of the Dow] is based on the theory that stocks can be over or undervalued, but over the long run those that are undervalued will 'revert to the mean.” Dow stocks are typically not inexpensive without reason. These companies rarely face the risk of going out of business, and their high yields often result from falling out of favor. According to a report by Forbes, historically, the Dogs have delivered strong long-term performance, but their recent results have been mixed. While they lagged behind the broader market in 2019, 2020, and 2021, they surged ahead in 2022, only to underperform again in 2023. Also read: 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy However, over the long term, the strategy has managed to outperform its benchmark. Michael O'Higgins found that over a 26-year period, a theoretical portfolio made up of high dividend-yield stocks from the Dow Jones delivered an annualized return of 17.9%. This performance exceeded the Dow Jones Industrial Average's annualized return of 13% during the same timeframe. A study in the International Journal of Trade, Economics, and Finance analyzed various versions of the DOD strategy and found that they consistently outperformed the DJIA on a risk-adjusted basis. The research explored three DOD variations: Dow-10, Dow-5, and the "Small Dogs of the Dow," while incorporating recent market events like the 2001 dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and the subsequent recovery. The study revealed that all three strategies delivered better investment performance than the DJIA between 1996 and 2006. Notably, the traditional Dow-10 portfolio achieved a total return of 406.6% during this time, surpassing the DJIA’s return of 355.6%. Despite the strong performance of the Dogs, analysts caution investors to approach this strategy with care. Kevin Simpson, founder and chief investment officer at Capital Wealth Planning, made the following comment in one of his interviews with CNBC: “The idea here is that just because they’re ‘Dogs of the Dow’ — some of them really are dogs — and you have to be careful and selective as a stock picker.” Our Methodology: We began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection. As a majority of the stocks in the index offer dividends, we specifically picked the 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 17. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

The US has been tightening its restrictions on China’s access to advanced chips used in AI because of national concerns.

This includes relying on open-source technology and developing their own super-fast software and chips. Chinese companies are developing open-source, or open-weight, LLMs. Developers can download them and build on top of them for free without having to obtain stringent licensing requirements from the inventor. “In the last year, we’ve seen the rise of open source Chinese contributions to AI with really strong performance, low cost to serve and high throughput”.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Important Stocks that Jim Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RH (NYSE:RH) stands against the other important stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the latest market volatility and said using too many AI algorithms, data points and correlations could be useful for short-term traders but for investors, these tools could blur your long-term vision. “I think as investors we're putting on mental shackles if we behave like this. Remember back in my hedge fund, our whole goal was day trading, was to scalp pennies from the flow. That's a lot of risk for not much reward. It's better to zero in on dollars for the big picture. That's what I want you to do.” Jim Cramer said that the market is currently oversold and this happened twice before in 2024. These moments, according to Cramer, proved to be some of the best entry points to pile into stocks in hindsight. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent programs and listed some of the stocks he commented on. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 39 Discussing home furnishing retailer RH (NYSE:RH) latest quarterly results, Jim Cramer praised the company’s CEO Gary Friedman: “I would tell you that in a market where the worst housing markets in three decades have been pulled off, there’s finally a lot of his European expansion that’s good. In America, it’s been turning well ahead of where I thought it was going to be even last quarter. My hat is off to him. There’s a gigantic short position now, some of it’s set to convert, but Gary bought so much stock, and people just felt he was rolling the dice. But Gary knew his business, and I think he’s a delight. I think he’s a competitor like none other, and congratulations.” RH (NYSE:RH) revenue in the recently reported quarter rose year over year while the company saw a 120.9% surge in adjusted operating income. During the earnings call, management disclosed that RH gained market share by 15-25 basis points in Q3 and expects to achieve another 25-45 basis points in gains during Q4. The housing market remains weak, so how was the company able to pull this off? The company is expanding to new products to support its outlet business and successfully launching new categories for baby, child, and teen products. RH anticipates that their contract, outlet, baby & child, and teen businesses will continue to drive business growth in FY25. Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH (NYSE:RH), Doximity, and Alight. We sold our position in furniture retailer RH due to our concerns over the company’s higher-than-average leverage in an uncertain economic environment. We also see the long-term growth outlook as less clear as the U.S. market matures and international expansion is nascent.

Title: New judge to preside over 1MDB's US$346mil suit against Rosmah

Thursday, 19 Dec 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and 10 other companies against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, alleging the use of misappropriated 1MDB funds to purchase luxury goods, is now under the jurisdiction of High Court Judge Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The development was confirmed by lawyer Villasha Anbalagan, who represents all the plaintiffs, comprising 1MDB and the 10 companies. "Today was the first case management before the new judge, Justice Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The court has fixed Feb 7 next year for the parties to update the status of the suit,” she said in a WhatsApp message following the proceedings conducted via Zoom. Last month, High Court Judge Justice Leong Wai Hong, a former partner at Messrs Skrine, recused himself from presiding over the lawsuit after granting Rosmah's application, citing his connection to the law firm. Rosmah’s recusal application raised concerns over a conflict of interest, as Skrine is representing 1MDB in a civil suit filed against her husband, former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, and several 1MDB officials. Before Justice Leong, the case was presided over by High Court Judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid, who dismissed Rosmah’s initial recusal application on Sept 9, on the grounds stating that she failed to provide evidence of a real danger of bias. ALSO READ: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case However, Justice Adlin’s consequent transfer to the High Court’s Intellectual Property Division, led to Justice Leong taking over the case. The lawsuit, filed on May 9 this year, involves 1MDB and its five subsidiaries-1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, and SRC International Sdn Bhd. The five other companies are Affinity Equity International Partners Limited, Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited, and Brightstone Jewellery Limited. The plaintiffs have named Rosmah and a woman identified as Shabnam Naraindas Daswani, also known as Natasha Mirpuri, as the first and second defendants, respectively. They are seeking a court order demanding Rosmah pay US$346,010,489 or an amount deemed appropriate by the court. The plaintiffs are also seeking declarations that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, which are purportedly in Rosmah’s possession.- Bernama Related stories: New judge to hear Rosmah’s caseRosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Respect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Tags / Keywords: 1MDB , Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya , Leong Wai Hong , recusal application , granted , Villasha Anbalagan Report it to us.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That’s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. “And so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,” Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That’s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn’s key investment strategies. “Having my eyes open to the big picture doesn’t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,” Einhorn said. To make the list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire David Einhorn, we scanned Greenlight Capital’s investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Greenlight Capital's stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Can China Shield the Biggest Uninsured Economy From Floods?
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2024/12/19/805422.htm
Time Published: 2024-12-19T07:51:30Z

The rivers and canals that meander through Hemudu in southeastern China are a vital source of life and community — they provide income for fishermen, an after-school hangout spot for kids, and define the town’s landscape. But when it rains, those waterways become a liability. “This area floods every year,” says Zheng, a long-time resident who lives less than a mile away from a river. Over the past decade and a half, Zheng has seen floodwater repeatedly threaten the ground-floor grocery store that he runs and his home above. But with his income “barely enough to make ends meet” and a grandson to look after, the 60-year-old says relocation isn’t an option. He’s tried but failed to insure his property. “Insurance companies turned us down because they said they’d have no chance to make money,” says Zheng, who asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal. “No one would take such a risk.” Zheng is one of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens whose homes and livelihoods have grown more precarious on a rapidly warming planet. Of the 20 most climate-vulnerable regions, 16 are on Chinese soil. Yet the world’s second-largest economy is among the least insured. Only about 10% of Chinese families have a home insurance policy, according to industry estimates. That figure is nearly 90% in the US. China’s government knows it has to do something about that gap, which Swiss Re AG estimates amounted to $273 billion in uninsured losses over the last decade. Officials first started seriously discussing the need to build an insurance system after the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake killed almost 90,000 people and cost an estimated 845 billion yuan ($116 billion). But uptake has been slow, and now climate change is making insurance increasingly unattainable all over the world. Part of the problem is cultural. Many Chinese people have traditionally relied on the government and family members in times of trouble, rather than market-based financial products. “Insurance as a service has not been widely accepted in China,” says Tian Ling, a professor at Wuhan University’s Economics and Management School. “If it’s up to Chinese individuals, very few people would buy catastrophe insurance. That leaves the government no choice but to purchase it for their citizens.” As China’s government faces pressure from the public to show it’s taking steps to protect people from more extreme weather, the nation’s top-down economic management style is colliding with an insurance industry upended by global warming. Officials have started buying policies that cover entire cities and provinces. But local authorities are short on cash, meaning the coverage they can afford is far from what’s needed, even as rising climate risks cause premiums to surge. The decade-long initiative instead risks downplaying how exposed people really are and could even backfire by making it harder to unlock national funds in times of crisis, since these regions are ostensibly covered by the private market. In 2014, the government of Ningbo, which oversees Hemudu, stepped in to buy citywide catastrophe insurance to cover residents like Zheng. A typhoon had wreaked havoc on the city the year before, prompting thousands of people to protest what they saw as insufficient disaster relief. It was one of the first experiments in what would eventually become a nationwide trial covering tens of millions of people in 74 cities and 15 provinces. Unlike Zheng’s failed attempt to buy his own coverage, insurers found the Ningbo government was a client they couldn’t refuse. Participating providers have lowered their prices so the government can afford it because the program is too important to fail, according to people familiar with the arrangement who requested anonymity to discuss private details. Ningbo officials secured a discount of several million yuan on the annual premium for the three-year policy signed in 2021, one of the people said, even though the initial, higher price was based on the city’s growing climate risks calculated using scientific models. Catastrophe insurance is not a lucrative business in Ningbo, according to an executive at PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd., a top Chinese insurer that has been part of the program since 2014. “We are not after financial returns,” the executive said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. When it comes to serving the government, “the political consideration outweighs anything else.” The Ningbo government and PICC did not respond to questions about the catastrophe insurance program. There is a potential risk for foreign investors backing the Chinese insurers that have been drawn into the programs. PICC has insured catastrophe risks for other provinces including Hebei, Sichuan and Zhejiang. China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., Asia’s biggest insurer, has sold policies to Henan’s government and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd. is among those supporting the technology hub Shenzhen. All three companies are listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Citigroup Inc. and BlackRock Inc., for example, hold 11% and 6% of PICC’s shares, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese insurers don’t publish detailed profit breakdowns to establish how much these government deals have affected their bottom lines. But their experience in Ningbo in 2015 gives some indication. A consortium led by PICC lost about 56 million yuan due to a string of calamities that year, according to a 2022 analysis done by the insurer, Ningbo University and the local government. The disasters put the program “at risk of bankruptcy,” the authors noted, and “sounded an alarm about its future liabilities.” Yet a growing number of local authorities have struck similar deals with insurers, covering longer periods of time. Wang He, chair of the China Association of Actuaries, has spent years studying the country’s catastrophe insurance problem. The ongoing local trials aren’t sustainable without broader publicly funded mechanisms to support communities after disaster, he says. “Catastrophe risk management falls within the realm of public management,” says Wang. A lack of understanding of that “public nature” in China has led to “a simplistic approach of delegating the job to the insurance industry, which is ill-equipped to shoulder the entire responsibility.” Without a wider protection system, flood victims like Zheng don’t have much recourse. In 2015, after Ningbo started its catastrophe insurance program, the shopkeeper received the first payout of his life. It was 1,000 yuan ($140), even though the water destroyed thousands of yuan worth of bottled water, snacks and everyday essentials such as toothbrushes that he could no longer sell. Located some 150 miles south of Shanghai, Ningbo is a land of historic relics and modern skyscrapers. The 7,000-year-old city owes much of its prosperity to the East China Sea, which once helped Ningbo carve out a spot on the ancient Silk Road and continues to make it a vital trading hub. But the bustling coastal region is also a magnet for natural disasters. The city, home to nearly 10 million people, has been battered by more than 40 storms over the last two decades.While that first payout in 2015 left the insurers who sold the policy in deficit, the government was pleased with the 78 million yuan its residents received. It was almost twice what the government had spent on premiums. The apparent success convinced officials to turn the one-year pilot into a three-year deal. It also turned Ningbo into a shining example of how to deploy catastrophe insurance. Bureaucrats from all over China flocked to the city to learn how to replicate the program at home. But local governments across the country face the same dilemma as Ningbo. They’re trillions of yuan in debt and grappling with an economic slowdown that’s seen China’s government add a sweeping package of stimulus measures. There isn’t enough cash to dole out when disaster strikes; even investing in insurance policies can be a stretch. In 2021, when record rain battered Henan province in central China, killing nearly 400 people, relief spending ballooned to 100 million yuan in a matter of days. China said last year that it will issue 1 trillion yuan in special Treasury bonds to raise funds for future calamities. The central government typically allocates relief funds after an area is hit by destructive weather, but how much trickles down to individual households depends on how local authorities decide the money should be spent. China’s top leaders signaled this month that the nation will increase public borrowing and spending in 2025, but officials have so far been reluctant to directly hand out cash or significantly widen the social safety net. President Xi Jinping has warned against falling into a trap of “welfarism” or “feeding lazy people.” All that makes catastrophe insurance an appealing solution. Still, the policies are pricey because they guard against extreme risks and premiums are rising quickly as reinsurers brace for higher climate damages. The World Bank estimates that China will lose as much as 2.3% of its economic output to weather perils made worse by global warming by the end of this decade. The Ningbo Model — as the insurance program was dubbed by the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily — has been held up as a win-win answer because it enlists the private sector to lessen the financial burden on the state and payments are quicker without having to deal with government red tape. But it also has some less appealing characteristics. Unlike traditional insurance, where payouts are commensurate with actual losses, Ningbo has a “parametric insurance” policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit. A home inundated with, say, 7 inches of water might not meet the requirement for a payout if the trigger requires floodwaters to reach 7.8 inches. There’s also a cap on each payment. If their house collapses, a family only stands to receive a maximum payout of 10,000 yuan in a given year. An average house in Ningbo is worth 23,000 yuan per square meter. Since the program started, eligible households have received under 660 yuan each on average, less than 1% of the annual disposable income for the city’s residents. The insurers behind Ningbo’s program have gradually raised the upper limit for payouts, but how far they can go comes back to how much the government can afford in premiums. Ningbo is home to China’s second-busiest cargo port and a petrochemical industry worth $72 billion, helping it to weather China’s economic woes better than many of its neighbors. Even so, local officials rejected an informal proposal to turn its current three-year policy into a five-year arrangement, due in large part to concerns over the government’s ability to commit to the program long term, according to one of the people familiar with the deal. In recent years, the government has also added clauses to the policy that likely wouldn’t pass muster in the West. Starting from 2021, participating insurers are required to channel a chunk of their underwriting profits to Ningbo’s disaster relief fund if the city avoids major damages during their time of service. That, together with the push to raise compensation levels, has forced the insurers to operate on razor-thin margins, even in good years. The practice is “not widely used in commercial markets,” says Christopher Au, climate practice lead for Asia Pacific at insurance broker WTW. But because insurers can tap the relief fund under some circumstances if payouts exceed what they’ve collected in premiums, Au says the arrangement can also potentially help spread out their risk and reduce the volatility of profits and losses from year to year. To keep climate-induced losses at bay, Ningbo has improved its early-warning system for typhoons and moved some residents out of floodplains. But the insurance program is remains a cosmetic addition to the city’s arsenal of protection measures. All told, it offers a maximum coverage of 500 million yuan per year for natural catastrophes. A 2022 study published in Nature estimates that climate change will increase the frequency of super typhoons in Zhejiang province, where Ningbo sits, causing damages as high as 36 billion yuan on average every eight years by the end of the century. The intention was always for government-funded insurance to eventually translate into a more robust private market. In theory, as beneficiaries of the public program grew more familiar with the idea of insurance, they would start buying policies of their own. Yet less than 40% of Ningbo residents surveyed for the 2022 analysis expressed interest in purchasing their own catastrophe insurance. Local governments will likely remain the driving force behind any catastrophe insurance in China for the coming years, says Wang Xujin, executive director of the Insurance Society of China, an industry group. One way to keep premiums manageable for local governments is to scale up the program across the country, spreading risk over vast areas with different climate risks. That’s easier said than done. For one, some poorer local governments simply don’t have the resources to spare. It will also be extremely difficult to convince officials in lower-risk areas to split the bill with those that are more highly exposed, he says. There have been attempts within the central government to set up a national catastrophe insurance program, says Wuhan University’s Tian. But none of the talks have borne fruit. “The discussions always circle back to one issue,” she says. “Who pays?” Wang He, from the China Association of Actuaries, says he’s concluded there’s only one solution. China needs to build a “new national system” that establishes a disaster relief fund for the whole country financed by the central government and other financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds. Until then, Chinese officials are eager to point to the growing insurance program as evidence that they’re taking action. Ningbo’s government has touted it as a “shock absorber” for the economy that will help boost social stability. In Shiqiao, a canal-side suburb of Ningbo, a tailor surnamed Lin is mollified that the state is at least trying to do something about the constant flooding. Like Zheng, she also received an insurance payout of 1,000 yuan after waist-deep water inundated her home in 2022 and soaked a stockpile of new solar-powered water heaters she had planned to sell. “The 1,000 yuan is far from enough to cover my losses,” she says. “But it’s better than nothing.” Photograph: Ningbo has a parametric insurance policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit.

Title: How did BlackRock’s ETF acquire the first blockchain municipal bond? – Details

By reducing costs and increasing transaction speed, BlackRock ETF’s adoption marks a pivotal step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream finance In a groundbreaking move, BlackRock’s ETF has purchased the first-ever municipal bond issued through blockchain technology. This marks a significant milestone for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. This development could reshape how bonds are issued and traded. It showcases blockchain’s growing potential in mainstream financial markets. BlackRock’s Municipal Income Bond ETF acquired the inaugural blockchain-issued bond from the Franklin Township in Ohio. The bond was created using Provenance Blockchain, an open-source platform designed for financial assets. This transaction sets a precedent for leveraging decentralized technology in municipal finance. “This transaction demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in improving efficiency and transparency in bond issuance,” said Franklin Township Treasurer, Amy Parker. The $15 million municipal bond will fund infrastructure projects within the township, including road and public works upgrades. The bond eliminates intermediaries by using blockchain, reducing issuance costs and increasing transaction speed. The acquisition by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, highlights blockchain’s increasing adoption in institutional finance. Historically, municipal bonds were issued through traditional financial intermediaries, which often added complexity and costs. Blockchain streamlines this process by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. “Blockchain’s integration into municipal bonds opens the door for a more efficient and secure financial ecosystem,” said Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO. This move could encourage more institutions to explore blockchain for financial instruments, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Adopting blockchain in municipal bonds could redefine the financial landscape, making it more accessible and transparent. Analysts believe this innovation could encourage smaller municipalities to consider blockchain-based bonds, especially since reduced costs make it more viable for low-budget projects. Additionally, investors stand to benefit from greater transparency. Blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures real-time tracking of bond transactions, enhancing accountability. “This technology democratizes access to investments while ensuring greater security and compliance,” noted David Treat, blockchain lead at Accenture. While this transaction is a significant step forward, adopting blockchain-based bonds will require further regulatory clarity and infrastructure development. BlackRock’s involvement provides credibility, signaling that blockchain is now integral to traditional finance rather than being confined to cryptocurrencies. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 As more institutional players recognize blockchain’s value, the divide between conventional finance and crypto continues to narrow. This convergence could pave the way for a future where blockchain underpins a broader range of financial products. In the words of Amy Parker, “This is just the beginning of a new era in finance where technology drives inclusivity and efficiency.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Please note that these are estimated amounts only as of December 15, 2024 and could change if the iShares Funds experience subscriptions or redemptions prior to the ex-dividend date or due to other factors. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. BlackRock Canada expects to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts on or about December 27, 2024, for all funds. The record date for the 2024 annual distributions will be December 30, 2024, payable on January 3, 2025. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2024, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or CDS) in early 2025. BlackRock Canada expects to announce the final monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2024, on or about December 27, 2024, for all funds.

Title: Is RingCentral (RNG) Among Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top Long-Term Stock Picks?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) stands against other Billionaire Paul Singer’s long-term stock picks. The world’s “most feared investor,” Paul Singer, needs no introduction. He has built a reputation on Wall Street for his aggressive and litigious tactics that often generate significant shareholder value. While the 79-year-old billionaire investor is not as flashy or public as other activist investors, he has built a reputation for exploiting weaknesses in various asset classes. Singer’s initial approach to investing was to target companies and even governments while purchasing extremely distressed debt. Therefore, he is best known as a “vulture capitalist” as a result of this tactic. Since then, he has diversified into a number of investment strategies, such as activist investing, portfolio management, and commodity trading. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Elliott Management is the investment firm that Singer founded in 1977 with $1.3 million. It has grown to become one of the most successful and feared activist hedge funds, with about $19 billion in portfolio value. The firm serves as the management affiliate for hedge funds Elliott Associates L.P and Elliott International Limited. The firm boasts of an annual average return of 14% since inception. Likewise, it has only lost money in the two years since its inception. Elliott Associates is one of the most tracked hedge funds and it employs an activist investment strategy. It also acquires significant though minority stakes in underperforming and distressed companies or assets with a view of unlocking long-term value. In addition, the firm strives to influence company management through strategic initiatives such as cost cuts, management changes and business sales to maximize shareholder value. Singer’s investment firm also purchased distressed sovereign debt from nations like Argentina and Peru in the 1990s. The investments resulted in multi-million dollar repayments following years of legal disputes. In 2016 Singer received a $2.4 billion payout after warring with Argentina’s government over bond payments. A 2018 article in The New Yorker magazine called him a “doomsday investor” for his strategies, including corporate debt plays in companies. Paul Singer’s investment record speaks for itself. His hedge fund, Elliott Management, returned 5.9% in 2022 as the S&P 500 went down 19%. Nevertheless, the firm underperformed in 2023, turning 4.3% compared to a 24% gain for the S&P 500. The underperformance came as Singer remained cautious amid concerns that The US economy was staring at an “extraordinarily dangerous and confusing period”. In addition to the high interest rates, the billionaire hedge fund manager raised concerns about the overstretched valuations and prospects of paltry returns in the real estate and financial services sector. Fast forward, the equity market has continued to edge higher in 2024. The S&P 500 is already up by more than 30%, with valuations in various counters getting out of hand. Nevertheless, macroeconomics shows improvement following the Federal Reserve’s bid to cut interest rates and steer the economy into a soft landing. As the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Elliott Management, Singer has diversified his holdings as one of the ways of shrugging heightened volatility. Consequently, billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks are spread across the basic materials, services and utilities segments. There are also healthcare, energy, and financial services holdings. To make the list of billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks, we scanned Elliott Management’s investment portfolio. We then settled on stocks the hedge fund has held for two years and more. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Elliott Management’s stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: The Boeing Company (BA): The Best Aviation Stock According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-company-ba-best-aviation-061633250.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) stands against the other best aviation stocks. Aviation stocks are the shares of firms in the aviation industry, such as airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators. The global lockdowns triggered by the pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air travel worldwide decreased by 60% in 2020 as a result of the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were only 1.8 billion passengers flying through 2020, down from almost 4.5 billion in 2019, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), while seating capacity dropped by about 50% in 2020. Despite these challenges, the airline industry has regained stability as lockdowns have lifted and normalcy has returned. Verified Market Size estimated that the global airline market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.21% from 2024 to 2031, from a 2023 valuation of $569.02 billion to $732.66 billion. The industry is mostly driven by the development of fuel-efficient aircraft and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the implementation of SAF could cut aviation emissions by as much as 80%, supporting the industry’s sustainability objectives and reducing operating expenses. Currently, airlines are facing record demand. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people were anticipated to travel by road and air this Thanksgiving, with the number of travelers exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Seat occupancy on airplanes has increased from 74% in 2003 to 84% in the first ten months of this year. The seat occupancy rate jumped from 69% in 2004 to 79% this year, even during slower months like January. According to the Consumer Price Index, airfares rose by more than 10% between July and October as a result of the limited availability. Reduced competition and flight cuts by budget carriers, such as a 10% holiday reduction, have further reduced availability, raising prices and reducing the number of reasonably priced options. U.S. Airlines and Aircraft Leasing Analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan claims, “Our prevailing thesis is that demand for premium and international air travel continues to lead the market.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will transport about 5 billion passengers by 2024. According to IATA’s 2024 forecasting, airlines should report net earnings of $30.5 billion this year, up from $25.7 billion in December. It was estimated that the industry’s overall revenues would increase by over 10% to a record $996 billion. The projected profit “is a great achievement considering the recent deep pandemic losses,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said while addressing the annual general assembly of the trade association in Dubai. According to IATA, which has more than 300 members and accounts for 83% of all air traffic globally, North American airlines are expected to generate about half of all profits in 2024, with a projected surplus of $14.8 billion, while European airlines are expected to see an increase in profits of between $8.6 billion and $9 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues will exceed $1.007 trillion, a 4.4% rise from 2024, and cross $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. It is projected that the number of passengers will reach 5.2 billion, which would be another significant milestone in the industry’s post-pandemic recovery. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General stated: “Looking at 2025, for the first time, traveler numbers will exceed five billion and the number of flights will reach 40 million. This growth means that aviation connectivity will be creating and supporting jobs across the global economy. The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers. But almost every business benefits from the connectivity that air transport provides, making it easier to meet customers, receive supplies, or transport products. On top of this, growth in aviation also contributes to achieving almost all the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” We sifted through holdings of Airline ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Aviation stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock’s Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year) as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52 The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a major defense and aerospace company. Commercial aircraft, military, space, and security, and global services are its three business segments. Boeing’s commercial jets division competes with Airbus in the development of aircraft that can seat more than 130 people. The company’s defense, space, and security division competes with Lockheed, Northrop, and numerous other companies to produce military aircraft, satellites, and weapons. Global Services provides aftermarket assistance to airlines. The confidence in the overall demand for aerospace products is further strengthened by Boeing’s substantial backlog, which spans many years of manufacturing for the most popular aircraft. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is in serious financial trouble, having lost $6.17 billion in Q3 2024 and almost $8 billion so far this year. The firm’s losses have been made worse by production slowdowns, supply chain delays, and a recent seven-week labor strike that put a halt to important programs. Nonetheless, the business’s $500 billion backlog, which amounts to more than seven years’ worth of sales, suggests that there will be a strong demand for its commercial aircraft in the future. Kelly Ortberg’s appointment as CEO offers fresh leadership to enhance operational effectiveness and reset investor expectations. Continued execution of its defense programs, as well as backlog fulfillment, could support recovery and future growth. Fidelity Dividend Growth Fund stated the following regarding The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Overweighting The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) also worked against the fund. The stock returned about -16% the past three months, sliding considerably in late July, as Q2 financial results for the aerospace giant came up well short of Wall Street’s expectations amid bigger-than-anticipated losses in both its commercial aviation and defense businesses. In July, the firm named former Rockwell Collins CEO Kelly Ortberg as its new president and CEO in an effort to move past ongoing production issues, cost overruns and delivery delays.” Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 5.58 million shares worth $848.85 million as of Q3. Overall, BA ranks 3rd on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Vera Wang’s ‘I Do’ With WHP Signals More Changes for Fashion Dealmaking

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The brand management giants are fast, well-funded and poised to get much bigger. Deputy Managing Editor From micro to macro, the fashion industry learns everything it needs to know where buyer meets seller. At the store, it’s all about the consumer, what they’re looking for, what’s hot, how they want to tell their own personal story and fill up their closets. It’s much the same with fashion companies, which often look to grow by snapping up new brands. Acquisitions when made from a position of strength can signal who’s in ascent — and lately it’s the brand management companies doing the buying. Related Articles Human Resources Marquee Brands Taps Former Authentic Exec Natasha Fishman as Chief Marketing Officer Fashion Scoops Bryson DeChambeau Signs On as a Reebok Golf Ambassador Just ask Vera Wang. You May Also Like This week she agreed to sell her famed brand to WHP Global. The deal was a reminder — if one were needed — of just how potent the business of owning intellectual property has become. Already this year, WHP has cut deals for Rag & Bone and Express. Meanwhile, its still-bigger competitor Authentic Brands Group added Champion to its mammoth stable while Marquee Brands bought the intellectual property of Totes Isotoner. Separating a brand from its operating structure is a business model that is still viewed somewhat skeptically by many in fashion, who wonder how sustainable the approach is and whether IP firms are ultimately something like the end of the line for distressed brands. Yehuda Shmidman, cofounder, chairman and chief executive officer of WHP, disagrees and said the brand management firms are not in just the distressed business anymore. “I know that that perception is out there,” Shmidman told WWD on Wednesday. “There’s been a sea change from the 1.0 version of this industry to where we are today, which is absolutely at a minimum 2.0 if not 3.0, 4.0.” Shmidman has lived and breathed that change, having started working at industry pioneer Iconix Brand Group almost 20 years ago. “I was there and I was a part of it and I was working day and night in it,” he said. “The business model was centered around sort of going into graveyards, digging up distressed brands, dead brands, resurrecting them in sort of cheap and deep ways. That was the 1.0 model. There are many, many examples. You can go back in history 20 years and just look at the brands that were dumped into Kmart or wherever.” That now is the province of liquidators, he said. “The brand management space has become something completely different and it’s taken years, it’s taken several decades, but where we are today is we actually do not at all ever buy distressed brands,” he said of WHP. “The thesis of WHP Global is about investing in strong brands that were in companies that for a variety of reasons have decided that they have not yet been able to expand. “We are not buying the Vera Wang IP because it’s distressed,” he said. “It’s the opposite. The Vera Wang brand is actually really, really strong.” Shmidman said the top three brand management players — Authentic, WHP and Marquee — account for about $50 billion in retail sales today and are on their way to $100 billion in five years. The sector has grown from $0 to $50 billion with a very specific step and repeat. “We bought an Italian soccer brand called Lotto. We own the IP globally, we brought it to the United States. We did a big deal with Dick’s Sporting Goods. Lotto is now in Dick’s in every store,” Shmidman said. While not exactly new, it’s an approach that’s gaining a lot of momentum. David Shiffman, who is head of consumer retail at Solomon Partners and worked on the Vera Wang deal, said the investment bank has worked on numerous sizable deals with the brand management companies over the past several years. “Historically, a lot of these businesses used to get sold to private equity firms. Private equity doesn’t play as much in the retail space anymore,” he said. “As such, the brand management companies have bought a number of these businesses. They’re not interested in holding inventory or having working capital. They own the intellectual property and then they seek to license it out by geography or by channel or by product category or by price point.” And that is an approach that private equity is ready to get behind. “It’s not a new business model, but it’s an innovative business model with great scale and reach,” Shiffman said. “You can get great synergies by continuing to bolt on more and more businesses. The combination of the ability to grow it, the high margins and free cash flow generation, the diversification as a result of owning a portfolio, I think that’s really interesting to PE.” The big money is all over the sector. WHP is backed by Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management and BlackRock. Authentic is backed by General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, and Leonard Green & Partners. And Marquee is backed by Neuberger Berman. That in turn means the companies have a lot of dry powder as they look for deals. “The most sophisticated investors in the world have tuned in and given us the ability to deploy unlimited capital, essentially, into the strategy of growing amazing brands through the technique of licensing,” Shmidman said. He described this as a kind of golden age for brand management. “Right now is the time, though, right now you either have the platform or you don’t,” Shmidman said, noting the biggest players all do have big networks to leverage. “Brands are for sale. They’re not always for sale. They’re for sale right now. And you need capital, which is very hard to get. And we have it. Long story short, for the people who say, ‘I’ve seen the movie before,’ I say to them, ‘You guys keep worrying. We’ll keep winning.’ “I see it in my pipeline, there are so many brands for sale,” he said. “In fact, there are more brands than buyers. So we’re going to end up buying a few, our competitors are going to buy a few, we’re all going to win in 2025.” It could be a trend that is not so much about fashion, but the broader world. Scott Markman, who is CEO of branding agency MonogramGroup and has worked with private-equity owned brands for years, said: “Consolidation is in every major business sector in the world, in America, and this is not unique to fashion. “Regardless of what Vera Wang thinks or doesn’t think or the retailers … or the supply chain … it’s going on across the entire economy. You either stiff arm it and say, ‘I’m not going to do this,’ or join the crowd. There’s no stopping this. It’s happened with food, it’s happened with cars. “Five years from now, if I’m the next Wang, I’m probably already thinking about that exit. I just know this is coming.” The Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

Title: Jack Boyle’s undoubted promise ensures a quick rise to prominence
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/12/19/jack-boyles-undoubted-promise-ensures-a-quick-rise-to-prominence/

By his own admission, it’s been a whirlwind start to Jack Boyle’s campaign. A good preseason was followed by selection for the Emerging Ireland tour (only to be forced to withdraw through injury) before inclusion in the Irish squad for the Autumn Nations Series and then his Champions Cup debut away to Bristol. Now he is in line for his fourth start of the season against Connacht at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday (kick-off 5.30pm). That Andy Farrell and co. included the 22-year-old loosehead in the Irish squad as an additional training panellist after he missed the Emerging Ireland tour is a clear indication of their belief in Boyle’s undoubted promise. It also whets his appetite. “You hear lads speaking about it so much, always ranting and raving about it, how much they love the environment and it’s the people in there, coaches, players, backroom staff, that make it special. Getting a taster is something that makes me hungry to try to get back there.” Boyle could come up against someone he now knows better after that Autumn Series, namely Finlay Bealham, as he did back in October at the Dexcom Stadium. “Finlay is an incredible player,” says Boyle. “He’s a great man as well. I got on very well with him but it’s up to us to get our process right and to stamp our authority on the game and we’re looking to have a go at set-piece time as well. We’re not just there to give it a dead duck. We’re properly ready to give it a go.” Coming up against Bealham is all part of the learning curve, which seems particularly steep and never-ending for young props, albeit Boyle is making good progress. He has always stood out as a rare prospect due to his strength and power, ever since his two first-half tries set St Michael’s on their way toward beating Gonzaga in the 2019 Leinster Schools Senior Cup final, which was a precursor to him being an ever-present in the Ireland Under-20s Grand Slam-winning side in 2022. Boyle had started playing mini rugby at Old Wesley, where there is a strong family connection through uncles, notably Eric, and his cousin Stephen, who played for Leinster Youths. He was a backrower until being converted into a prop when he was 15 at St Michael’s, and he cites Andy Skehan and Emmet MacMahon as major influences. “Coming out of a school like Michael’s or Blackrock, because they’re so strong and you’re so well coached, you’re probably a step ahead.” The quasi-professional set-up in St Michael’s was to his liking. “I suppose if you want to pursue a career in it you have to love it,” he reasons. “And maybe there’s some things like newsletters and things, but it’s all noise, really. When you’re 13, 14, 15, all you really care about is playing.” His 15-year-old brother, Herbie, is also causing waves in the St Michael’s Junior Cup team in the back row. Yet, a little surprisingly, Boyle had to work hard on his own renowned strength. “Naturally I wouldn’t be that heavy. I’ve always struggled to put on weight, [but] I want to play at a weight where I still feel I can be dynamic around the pitch. I don’t want to put on weight and it’s bad weight. “Dave Fagan, rest in peace, poor fella, he was really good over two years in the sub academy. He got my strength numbers right up, got everything up and then it was up to me to get eating more or less. But strength-wise it was a pretty big grind for a few years.” Nor can schools rugby properly prepare a young prop for senior rugby due to the restrictions on scrummaging, which has made his time in the AIL with UCD even more invaluable. “The big thing is time in the saddle, especially as a frontrower coming out of school where it’s not full scrums; it’s not a full contest. You’re pretty much thrown in the deep end, tighthead more than loosehead, out of school. The AIL is that stepping stone usually. “But the other thing is getting reps against the likes of Tadhg Furlong or Rabah Slimani here. You learn from the best in the business too on the professional side of it.” Boyle actually rooms with Slimani who, as the first Frenchman to ever play for Leinster, has extra novelty value. And the younger man has a balanced take on the IRFU’s decision to prohibit the provinces from importing foreign frontrowers henceforth. “You have to always back yourself. I feel like if I’m playing well then, I deserve to play, but at the same time if they’re bringing in the likes of Rabah Slimani, you need to try and get as much information out of him as possible. “I know he’s at tighthead now, but you don’t look at it in the way of ‘he’s blocking whoever’. You have to learn off him. He’s there to help you as well. It’s not just to block you.” In addition, of course, Boyle could hardly have a more experienced duo of looseheads to learn from than Andrew Porter and Cian Healy. “He’s unbelievably special in the group,” Boyle says of Healy. “I think we’ll only acknowledge it when he’s gone, he’s added so much to the younger lads coming through, not only around set-piece stuff, but off field, recovery, that kind of thing as well. “We’re in a very special and unique situation in club rugby, to have the likes of those four or five front-rowers to learn off.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Aviation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Air Transport Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) stands against the other best aviation stocks. Aviation stocks are the shares of firms in the aviation industry, such as airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators. The global lockdowns triggered by the pandemic caused significant disruptions to the travel industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air travel worldwide decreased by 60% in 2020 as a result of the significant disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were only 1.8 billion passengers flying through 2020, down from almost 4.5 billion in 2019, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), while seating capacity dropped by about 50% in 2020. Despite these challenges, the airline industry has regained stability as lockdowns have lifted and normalcy has returned. Verified Market Size estimated that the global airline market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.21% from 2024 to 2031, from a 2023 valuation of $569.02 billion to $732.66 billion. The industry is mostly driven by the development of fuel-efficient aircraft and the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States claims that the implementation of SAF could cut aviation emissions by as much as 80%, supporting the industry’s sustainability objectives and reducing operating expenses. Currently, airlines are facing record demand. According to AAA, nearly 80 million people were anticipated to travel by road and air this Thanksgiving, with the number of travelers exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Seat occupancy on airplanes has increased from 74% in 2003 to 84% in the first ten months of this year. The seat occupancy rate jumped from 69% in 2004 to 79% this year, even during slower months like January. According to the Consumer Price Index, airfares rose by more than 10% between July and October as a result of the limited availability. Reduced competition and flight cuts by budget carriers, such as a 10% holiday reduction, have further reduced availability, raising prices and reducing the number of reasonably priced options. U.S. Airlines and Aircraft Leasing Analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan claims, “Our prevailing thesis is that demand for premium and international air travel continues to lead the market.” The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airlines will transport about 5 billion passengers by 2024. According to IATA’s 2024 forecasting, airlines should report net earnings of $30.5 billion this year, up from $25.7 billion in December. It was estimated that the industry’s overall revenues would increase by over 10% to a record $996 billion. The projected profit “is a great achievement considering the recent deep pandemic losses,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said while addressing the annual general assembly of the trade association in Dubai. According to IATA, which has more than 300 members and accounts for 83% of all air traffic globally, North American airlines are expected to generate about half of all profits in 2024, with a projected surplus of $14.8 billion, while European airlines are expected to see an increase in profits of between $8.6 billion and $9 billion. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues will exceed $1.007 trillion, a 4.4% rise from 2024, and cross $1 trillion for the first time in 2025. It is projected that the number of passengers will reach 5.2 billion, which would be another significant milestone in the industry’s post-pandemic recovery. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General stated: “Looking at 2025, for the first time, traveler numbers will exceed five billion and the number of flights will reach 40 million. This growth means that aviation connectivity will be creating and supporting jobs across the global economy. The most obvious are the hospitality and retail sectors which will gear up to meet the needs of a growing number of customers. But almost every business benefits from the connectivity that air transport provides, making it easier to meet customers, receive supplies, or transport products. On top of this, growth in aviation also contributes to achieving almost all the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” We sifted through holdings of Airline ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Aviation stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. We have used the stock’s Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year) as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 16 Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG), a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air transportation services, specializes in medium wide-body freighter aircraft. Through its varied companies, it provides a distinctive Lease+Plus aircraft leasing possibility within the aviation industry. The North American and European markets account for the majority of the company’s sales. It is among the best airline stocks, having increased by more than 32% so far this year. In the third quarter of 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)’s free cash flow improved dramatically, going from a negative $51.6 million to $86.4 million. Operating cash flow increased 15.35% year over year. Additionally, the business declared a final deal to be bought out by alternative investment firm Stonepeak for all cash for about $3.1 billion. Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG)’s leasing division benefited from strong demand, with four Boeing 767-300 freighter leases signed in the third quarter. However, third-quarter profitability was impacted by higher expenses and fewer block hours flown. By the end of 2024, the firm intends to sign three additional leases for freighters owned by CAM and expects significant benefits in its ACMI Services division as a result of contractual price increases. On November 5, 2024, Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) announced that it had entered into an acquisition agreement with Stonepeak for $22.50 per share. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli increased the firm’s price target for the business from $15 to $22.50. In a research note, the analyst informed investors that Stonepeak’s implied take-out multiple for the deal is 20% lower than peers’, but this is likely justified given recent operating performance, pilot union contract unknowns, and greater exposure to older freighter platforms as opposed to newer passenger variant aircraft. John Osterweis’s Osterweis Capital Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database at the end of Q3 2024. It owns 29 million shares worth $29.80 million as of Q3. Overall, ATSG ranks 10th on our list of the best aviation stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ATSG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ATSG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15 Revenue Growth Rate (year-over-year): 17.35% One of the Best Airline Stocks, Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY), operates low-cost carriers. The company runs in two segments: Cargo and Passenger. Scheduled service and charter are the two internal passenger groupings in the passenger segment. Air cargo services are offered by the Cargo segment. The passenger segment generates the lion’s share of revenue. With a record third-quarter revenue of $249 million, Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY) had a 0.24% YoY increase. Despite obstacles like the Crowdstrike outage and hurricanes that affected operations, cargo revenue grew by 11.9% year over year, while charter revenue grew by 7.0%. For the ninth consecutive quarter, the business was profitable, with GAAP diluted EPS of $0.04 and adjusted EPS of $0.06. The price objective for Sun Country Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCY) was increased by Barclays from $20 to $24 on November 14, 2024. According to the firm, airline fundamentals will “turn sharply positive” in 2025 and would probably lead to a “much more favorable market perception for the group,” which might allow for significant share price growth for the leaders in the industry, such as Delta, United, and Alaska. In a research note, the analyst warns investors that a “powerful rally in airline equities looking into next year” may be fueled by the convergence of strengthening airline fundamentals and market optimism. The “winners will keep winning,” according to Barclays. As capacity growth slows in 2025, low-cost carrier rivalry shifts and the “moats grow deeper for the winners in the industry,” the company argues that airlines offer substantial upside potential.

Title: Two directors of Epic Games, Tencent resign amid antitrust investigation
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/19/two-directors-of-epic-games-tencent-resign-amid-antitrust-investigation
Time Published: 2024-12-19T04:22:24Z

The US Department of Justice says it expressed concerns directors’ positions on two company boards violated Clayton Act. Two directors of Fortnite creator Epic Games who were appointed by Chinese tech company Tencent Holdings have resigned their positions in the wake of an antitrust investigation in the United States. The US Department of Justice said in a statement on Wednesday that it had “expressed concerns” that the directors’ positions on both the Epic and Tencent boards were in violation of the Clayton Act because Tencent owns Riot Games, a Los Angeles-based video game developer and e-sports organiser. Section 8 of the Clayton Act “prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions”, according to the Justice Department. “Scrutiny around interlocking directorates continues to be an enforcement priority for the Antitrust Division,” said Deputy Director of Civil Enforcement Miriam R Vishio of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. Epic Games and the US Justice Department did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. “Our relationship with Epic has always centred on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers. We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision,” Tencent said in an emailed statement. Beyond Fortnite, Epic Games is also known as the developer of the Unreal Engine, a groundbreaking 3D video game engine. The North Carolina-based Epic Games is privately held, but Tencent holds a minority stake in the company among its “equity investments” in other video game and media companies, according to the Justice Department. Other Epic Games investors include Sony, Disney, Fidelity and BlackRock. Tencent, one of the largest multimedia companies in the world, is incorporated and domiciled in the Cayman Islands but has its headquarters in China’s Shenzhen. The Justice Department’s statement did not mention any national security concerns around Tencent or its Chinese ownership, in contrast to the US government’s approach to other Chinese tech companies, such as ByteDance, which owns the social media platform TikTok. The video-sharing app is due to be banned in the US from January 19 if its Chinese owner ByteDance does not sell the platform. Following the investigation, Tencent decided to “amend its shareholder agreement with Epic to relinquish its unilateral right to appoint directors or observers to the Epic board in the future,” according to the Justice Department. The statement also said that despite the resignation of the two unnamed directors, “no company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation”.

Title: Report: Perplexity Closed $500 Million Funding Round in Early December

Perplexity AI reportedly closed a $500 million funding round earlier this month. The round tripled the artificial intelligence (AI) startup’s valuation to $9 billion, Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Dec. 18), citing an unnamed source. Reached by PYMNTS, Perplexity declined to comment on the report. The company’s backers include SoftBank, Nvidia and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to the report. Perplexity AI started 2024 with a valuation of $520 million. During the summer, it was valued at $3 billion. HSBC Innovation Capital said Monday (Dec. 16) that 42% of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024 — up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022 — and that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in a Monday press release. BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC. Perplexity said in November that it launched an AI-powered shopping assistant in the U.S. and plans to expand it to additional markets. The new Buy With Pro is available to Perplexity Pro users and helps shoppers both research and purchase products. In October, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said that the AI search company is serving over 100 million queries per week and aims to boost that figure to 100 million queries every day. Srinivas also said in October that Perplexity wants to form revenue-sharing partnerships with news publishers. He added that the company could supply publishers with chatbots that would respond to users’ queries on the publishers’ websites, using their content to provide answers. His comments came two days after Perplexity was sued by two News Corp-owned publishers that allege that the company’s AI search engine uses their copyrighted content to answer users’ questions and takes traffic that otherwise would have gone to the publishers’ sites. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Deutsche Bank to develop Ethereum layer-2 blockchain to tackle TradFi compliance issues

Project Dama 2 aims to address regulatory concerns by offering secure layer-2 blockchain solutions for financial institutions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Deutsche Bank is building a layer-2 blockchain based on Ethereum to solve the regulatory hurdles financial institutions face using public blockchains, Bloomberg News reported on Dec. 17. The platform, dubbed Project Dama 2, represents the German banking giant’s attempt to harness blockchain technology’s potential while minimizing risks associated with public ledgers, which can often inadvertently transact with sanctioned entities or criminals. The project, unveiled in November as a pilot, is designed to streamline asset servicing. It leverages ZKsync’s zero-knowledge proof (zkp) technology to offer cheaper and more efficient transactions. Moreover, using zkp will enable enhanced privacy and customization for institutional users developing on Deutsche Bank’s proprietary blockchain. Crypto firms Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs are aiding the platform’s development. Notably, Project Dama 2 is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian, which signals a growing interest among traditional financial players in blockchain-based asset servicing and tokenization solutions. JPMorgan executed its first transaction on a public blockchain in late 2022, also as part of Project Guardian, while Visa is exploring the tokenization of fiat currencies for traditional banks. Meanwhile, traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have tokenized money funds with a combined market cap of over $1 billion. Public blockchains offer immense efficiency for regulated lenders. Ethereum is the favored infrastructure by institutions, as it dominates 81% of the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). However, the report pointed out that these benefits come with uncertainty over who validates transactions, the possibility of transaction fees reaching sanctioned entities, and the risk of unforeseen blockchain hard forks that could disrupt operations. The solution found by Deutsche Bank was adding its own layer-2 blockchain to the mix. Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, stated: “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied.” As a result, Project Dama 2 connects to Ethereum while allowing the bank to sidestep some of the alleged risks inherent in public blockchains. By creating a curated list of transaction validators and offering tools to give regulators exclusive “super admin rights,” the bank hopes to provide a more secure and compliant blockchain experience.

Title: Is Gannett Co., Inc. (GCI) the Best News and Digital Media Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) stands against other news and digital media stocks to buy now. Digital experiences comprise a significant part of consumers’ lives in today’s digital age. According to Deloitte, consumers spend an average of eight hours engaging in online activities every day, which makes up about half of their waking hours. These trends are more prominent among Gen Z and millennials, who spend around nine hours on average on online activities every day. In contrast, Gen X and boomers spend around seven and six hours on average daily, respectively. Around 7 in 10 respondents claim that they go online daily to use social media, carry out general web browsing, or communicate with their friends and family. 74% of Gen Z and millennials check their social media several times every day, with 20% of Gen Z checking their feeds at least every hour. In contrast, 57% of Gen X and 39% of boomers check their social media multiple times a day. 61% of consumers surveyed said that they interact with digital media daily by consuming entertainment (watching movies, sports, or television) on a streaming service. Similarly, around 48% said they listen to a podcast or music daily. A study by Deloitte shows that US households spent around $760 on average on acquiring connected devices in 2024, down from $800 in 2023. Consumer technology spending fell between 2022 and 2023, primarily due to pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. However, estimates show that this spending is expected to bounce back, experiencing a 1% growth in revenue in 2024 and an extra 4.4% growth in 2025. Deloitte’s 2024 Connected Consumer Survey corroborates this claim, as it shows that 28% of respondents have plans to increase their device spending in 2025, up from 9% in 2023. In contrast, around 23% of people are planning to reduce their device purchase spending, up from 7% in 2023. This trend is attributed to the ongoing financial pressures on US consumers. Recent Pew Research Center surveys show a falling number of US adults who follow the news closely. Consumers for several older types of news media, such as local television stations, public radio, and newspapers, are dwindling as well. However, audiences for a few particular media brands are increasing, including newer digital platforms such as podcasts and social media. According to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey, nearly 50% of all US adults claimed that they sometimes get news from social media. Although those who use social media to get news like various things about it, such as speed, convenience, and preciseness, some consumers express concerns about the practice. They claim news attained from social media isn’t always accurate, is seldom low in quality, and tends to be politically biased. Inaccuracy is increasingly becoming the most disliked aspect of social media news, going from 31% who said the same to 40% in the past five years. Similarly, an Ernst & Young (EY) report on key entertainment and media trends for 2024 showed that consumer dissatisfaction with paying for unused television channels was leading to the rise of streaming services. Such services allowed households to personalize their content and reduce costs simultaneously. Media companies are now facing the challenge of maintaining a profitable balance between traditional cable and linear broadcast networks and streaming platforms. Digital media companies are also employing artificial intelligence to regulate their operations, boosting incremental growth and productivity. However, risks regarding the implementation of GenAI persist. These include intellectual property protection, creative industries’ job security concerns, and privacy and accuracy challenges. To compile our list, we consulted online sources and ETFs to select 15 top news and digital media stocks. We then chose the top 12 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) is a diversified media company that operates through the Newsquest, Domestic Gannett Media, and Digital Marketing Solutions (DMS) segments. The Domestic Gannett Media segment operates USA TODAY. The company operates the Newsquest segment in the UK, which comprises more than 220 digital news and media brands across its portfolio. This includes over 150 weekly and daily newspapers and over 70 magazines. Gannett Co. (NYSE:GCI) also offers digital advertising and marketing solutions. The company’s digital revenue categories saw strong growth in fiscal Q3 2024. As a result, its total digital revenues surpassed 45% of total revenues, marking an all-time high for the company. It also generated around $20 million of free cash flow, showing a 168% increase compared to 2023. Gannett Co.’s (NYSE:GCI) audience also experienced growth in fiscal Q3 2024, surpassing 200 million average monthly unique visitors for the first time in the company’s history. This reflects a 7% growth compared to 2023. The primary drivers of audience growth for the company in fiscal Q3 2024 included political events, the kickoff to football season, and the Paris Olympics. The company’s digital-only subscription business is also bringing new highs. Its revenue surpassed $50 million in fiscal Q3 2024, and the average digital-only revenue per unit (ARPU) exceeded $8. Investors are bullish on the stock as this segment suggests considerable upside for the company through both pricing and volume growth. Fiscal Q3 2024 marked the company’s second consecutive quarter of year-over-year subscription growth, along with another quarter of sequential growth in digital-only paid subscriptions. Miller Deep Value Select Strategy stated the following regarding Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “During the quarter, our two largest positive contributors were Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE:GCI), whose market share price up 20% and United Natural Foods (UNFI), with a market share price up 31%. Gannett continues to make progress with their long-term transformation to a digital media company. Management expects digital revenues to become more than 50% of company sales over the coming year which would support the company’s return to annual revenue growth. In September, the DOJ presented a very strong case against Google for their Ad Tech business. Gannett’s anti-trust case against Google is very similar to the DOJ case, and we believe it remains overlooked by the marketplace. Gannett is being represented by Kellogg Hansen who won the two largest anti-trust verdicts ($1.2B and $1.3B) and were also successful in defending the appeals of those verdicts. While it is impossible to know with certainty the outcome of Gannet’s legal case, we find it interesting that Kellogg Hansen’s only compensation is tied to Gannett having success in winning their case. This is an important indication of alignment to us. In a scenario where Gannett wins a verdict in the neighborhood of the amount they are seeking, it may mean a windfall greater than all the net debt on the balance sheet. Assuming, as we do, that the current share price has not priced in such a development, the result would be a share price below two times normalized Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA). Compared with The New York Times, which currently trades at greater than nineteen times EV/EBITDA, a valuation at half of that multiple on normalized EBITDA would support an equity market cap more than $4B for Gannett. While there are risks of temporary setbacks with multi-year transformations, the current market valuation framework appears to remain focused on the company’s historical secular growth challenges. The biggest near-term risk would be unexpected weaker trends in print advertising, creating greater near-term secular revenue headwinds. A successful transformation, positive anti-trust case verdict, and potential non-core asset sale could lead to significant upside over time. We believe the shares remain significantly mispriced at only .3 times revenue and greater than 40% normalized free cash low yield.” Overall, GCI ranks 10th on our list of the best news and digital media stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GCI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) stands against the other best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the international entertainment and media industry was valued at $2.51 trillion in 2023. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7% to reach $3.55 trillion by 2028. Growth in the entertainment industry is driven by the rapid adoption of subscription models, the evolution of live events, and the use of augmented and virtual reality technologies.

A report published by FTI Delta earlier this year highlighted some significant trends and challenges in the media and entertainment industry. As per the report, the live entertainment sector has experienced a robust recovery, with global spending on live music in 2023 increasing by 49% compared to 2019. Major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLS, NHL, and IndyCar, have not only recovered but surpassed pre-pandemic attendance levels. The post-pandemic recovery within the industry has not been uniform. For instance, the filmed entertainment industry faced severe challenges in late 2023 due to strikes by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA. These disruptions led to a more than 70% decline in production and marketing expenditures, compounding existing issues from early 2023 when studios were already tightening budgets. As a result, spending in 2023 was down approximately 35% from 2022, reflecting a struggling market. The report anticipates recovery for filmed entertainment post-strike to be more subdued than previous rebounds, with projections of about 25% year-over-year growth in 2024. On the bright side, the report highlighted a significant growth trajectory for United States TV and connected TV (CTV) advertising, emphasizing the transformative impact of CTV on the advertising landscape. The combined US TV and CTV ad spending is projected to approach $100 billion by 2027, with CTV being the primary driver of this growth. In 2024 alone, CTV advertising is expected to increase by $5.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year growth. The surge in CTV advertising is largely attributed to the rise of premium ad-supported streaming services. In addition to a robust performance expected within the advertising segment, the gaming sector remains resilient. The video game industry achieved a CAGR of 9.2% from 2019 to 2022. Despite a 6.3% decline from the peak surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, console sales in 2022 remained 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels, indicating strong ongoing demand for gaming hardware. As per the report, the overall outlook for the video game market remains positive, with expectations of above mid-single-digit growth throughout the next year.

To compile the list of the 10 best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using these two sources we aggregated an initial list of entertainment stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we checked analysts’ upside potential for each stock and shortlisted stocks with an analyst upside potential of at least 25%. Lastly, we ranked our stocks in ascending order of the analysts’ upside potential. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database. Please note that the data was collected on December 13, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Analysts’ Upside Potential: 41.85% Number of Hedge Funds: 67 Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) is a major company in the casino and entertainment industry in the United States. It owns and operates over 50 casinos across the United States, primarily under well-known brands like Caesars, Harrah’s, and Horseshoe. The company runs hotels connected to its casinos, providing approximately 44,900 hotel rooms. It also hosts numerous live events such as concerts and shows at its properties, enhancing the overall guest experience beyond just gaming. In the third quarter of 2024, Caesars Digital, the online gaming and sports betting division of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR), showcased growth and performance. The segment reported $303 million in net revenues, marking a 41% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This reflects a strong demand for digital gaming and sports betting services. The segment also achieved a record adjusted EBITDA of $52 million, a significant rise from just $2 million in Q3 2023. Moreover, within the digital segment, the Caesars Palace app has been growing as a key contributor to overall iCasino revenues, highlighting the effectiveness of its mobile strategy. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) has launched the Horseshoe Casino brand in multiple states including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, with plans to expand into Ontario and New Jersey by year-end. It is one of the best entertainment stocks according to analysts. Choice Equities Capital Management stated the following regarding Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Caesars Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ:CZR) and GENI – Both Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and Genius Sports Limited operate in and around the entertainment, casino and gaming space. Caesars is a bit more well-known and discussed in brief below. Caesars Entertainment is the owner of a strong casino and entertainment brand, with a diverse portfolio of properties strategically focused on both physical and digital growth. The company’s leadership in the U.S. casino and resort industry is underpinned by its expansive footprint, including marquee properties on the Las Vegas strip, new and existing regional casinos in growing markets, and its growing Caesars Sportsbook platform. With the ongoing recovery in leisure and travel post-pandemic, combined with the secular tailwinds in online sports betting and iGaming, Caesars is well-positioned to capture growth across multiple segments. Recently emerging from a sizeable multi-year investment cycle, shares of Caesars look attractive on a mid-teens yield of forward cash-flows. Some recent refinancings and a share buyback highlight the improved look of the company’s financials.” Overall, CZR ranks 4th on our list of best entertainment stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CZR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Jim Cramer Crowned PayPal (PYPL) as the New King of FinTech: Why It’s Poised for Big Gains

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the Jim Cramer Just Discussed These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. As the Federal Reserve exits the year by having continued its interest rate cuts, Wall Street is wondering what 2025 will hold for markets. Inflation is a key concern among investors, and many believe that the Fed might have to update its models that determine the rate cuts. This update will account for any potential uptick in inflation and one which might be spurred by tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump Administration. In a fresh episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer commented on what might happen once the interest rate cuts intensify and how these effects might tie in with Trump's strategies. Cramer doesn't "understand that people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." According to him if the tariffs go through then the CPI can rise which will lead the Fed to not cut interest rates. But, if the tariffs don't materialize or if "they're targetted tariffs, and we get break in housing, I mean we just saw Tol Brothers, I know it's only one million dollar house and not a hundred and fifty, but it starts somewhere. And we get some more apartments come in and we have big inventories from more than Ford." In the event the CPI rises, Cramer believes that "A year we'll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that's over." As a result, he believes that it is important to focus on "what the President-elect is gonna do. Why do we have to focus so much on what's going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?" Cramer also believes that the US needs more workers. Commenting on Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son announcing $100 billion in investments at Trump's Mar-e-Lago resort, Cramer stated "I think the most important thing is we don't have the workers for this stuff." He added "The idea that we get the workers, and we do not have a good birth rate, robust birth rate, we do not have enough workers, we're gonna have immigration reform. You know you wanna create jobs, what you need are people to fill them and we don't have it." Another matter that's caught Cramer's attention when it comes to the President-elect is Trump's remarks about taking on healthcare benefit managers once he assumes power. During a press conference at Mar-e-Lago, the President-elect shared that Americans were "paying far too much,. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare. He added "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don't do anything except they're a middleman." Trump says that his team will "knock out the middle man [AND HE'S] going to be very unpopular after that." According to Cramer, "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress," as "when you have that kind of come together over them, you don't wanna be in that business." Cramer commented on the impact the President-elect's comments had and can have on the pharma benefits management industry. According to him "these companies are not, uh, without their friends. And by the way, they all resent the middlemen. Cardinal's had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. McKesson is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product." Craner added that "the drug will all give you some great data which shows you that they are not the cause of the inflation. But they always are willing to finger, uh, United Health," and as for the environment surrounding healthcare benefit managers, "right now, I've never seen it this bad for them."

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 90 PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology company that enables users to access alternative banking systems to make transactions. Its exposure to consumer payments means that the firm relies on economic health and spending to boost transaction volume for higher commissions. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s 400 million users worldwide not only provide the firm with a wide moat but also a sizable user base to monetize. The firm is currently leveraging user data to generate advertising revenue. Cramer believes that PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best plays in the financial technology sector: "Well, I was going to give you one that, that David introduced me to, that is, I'm crowning the new king of fintech, Paypal. Breaking out here. No, no, Barclays just joined this and pattern says basically this is better than all the others. And I think, PayPal spewing cash, this guy Alex Chriss is doing a terrific job of, February meeting, everybody will know it then. Kind of like when Marvell, everyone should have known, when Matt Murphy goes and buys a million dollars worth it's not idle. Overall, PYPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer just discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Three Predictions For 2025
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/18/three-predictions-for-2025
Time Published: 2024-12-18T17:45:49Z

No one can argue with 2024 being a breakthrough year for crypto. BTC and ETH ETFs launched, BlackRock spearheaded bitcoin adoption, a pro-crypto president was elected and BTC broke the 15-year all-time-high, to name a few. But the inflection point for crypto still awaits. Here are three predictions for 2025 that can help spark it: You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. 1. DeFi is about to skyrocket DeFi is becoming more complex, much like traditional finance, in terms of its product suite. We’ve already seen this trend emerging with the adoption of products like Pendle, Ethena, EtherFi and Lombard. In 2025, DeFi usage will explode, with a wave of adoption for products such as options, swaps, and other derivatives like the interest rate swap market — the latter’s market size is at 465.9 trillion USD in TradFi. Moreover, new institutional players are entering the crypto ecosystem, nurturing a new category: On-chain finance. Participation is no longer limited to buying blue-chip cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. These market participants also actively expand on-chain market depth by using tools such as lending markets and liquidity provision with RWA-backed digital assets, i.e. stablecoins. Securitize and BlackRock are great examples of companies pushing the frontier on this front. DeFi is almost back to its all-time-high, Source: https://defillama.com/ 2. Stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto killer use case Stablecoins aren’t just another crypto product; they’re poised to become the digital backbone of the global financial system. Tether is the most profitable crypto company with a $5.2 billion profit in H1 2024, surpassing BlackRock. The political landscape is shifting dramatically in favour of stablecoins, with Operation Choke Point 2.0 coming to an end. They are finally being viewed as a national asset that can strengthen the dominance of the U.S. dollar and address growing public debt. This shift also paves the way for major banks and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard to expand their efforts in the sector, especially when you consider Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion (the biggest acquisition in crypto ever) and rumors of Revolut launching its stablecoin. Stablecoins market cap is at an All-Time-High already at about $200 billion, Source: https://defillama.com/stablecoins 3. The race for retail adoption ETFs will be key drivers for new capital to enter crypto. BTC ETFs are here, and soon we’ll see the success of Ethereum ETFs. After SOL’s undeniable growth over the last year, the SOL ETF will either catch the momentum and become a reality in the first half of 2025 or will delay until 2026 or later. We’ll also see major Web3 social platforms compete with the LensChain mainnet launch and Farcaster’s further expansion. As the pie grows bigger, we can end up with the "Twitter/X and Facebook of crypto" platforms. Notably, “Super Wallets” took off in Q4 2024. They aim to offer a comprehensive alternative to centralized exchanges for new users. The leading players are Infinex, launched by Kain Warwick, and DeFiApp, launched by seasoned builders in DeFi. Both are working on UX problems, something we have never done very well as an industry. Bonus prediction: MiCA will power crypto expansion in Europe Crypto regulations provide the foundations for new projects. They lay the groundwork for clear rules and guidelines of organizational structure. MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) attempts to bring just that with an aim to increase the importance of EUR-related assets. This could potentially bridge crypto innovation between the U.S. and Europe.

Title: Is The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) the Best Cash-Rich Dividend Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Cash-Rich Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against the other cash-rich dividend stocks. Cash remains a critical asset, as companies with strong cash reserves tend to attract investors regardless of the economic climate. A robust cash position allows businesses to enhance shareholder value through activities such as paying dividends, buying back shares, or pursuing strategic acquisitions. That said, cash has underperformed compared to other assets, but with yields at their highest in years and economic and inflation uncertainty, many people have chosen to keep their extra funds in money markets, certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts, and Treasury bills. A survey conducted in July by Empower found that 49% of Americans felt more secure holding cash than other investments. The survey, which polled 1,009 US adults, also found that cash made up more than 27% of respondents' portfolios. However, financial experts like Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, generally recommend keeping only 3% to 5% of a portfolio in cash for emergencies and liquidity needs. Also read: 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy The US financial markets are currently supported by an enormous pool of liquidity, with substantial funds held in money market accounts and other short-term investments. According to T. Rowe Price, US money market funds alone managed nearly $6 trillion in assets as of mid-December 2023—an increase of over 60% since December 2019, just before the onset of the pandemic. As of the week ending December 4, a record $6.77 trillion is held in money market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. This amount is nearly half a trillion dollars higher than the funds held in September before the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut in four years, followed by another in November. A report from treasury advisory firm Carfang Group noted that corporate cash reserves have steadily grown since the pandemic began. The ongoing strength of the economy has enabled companies to set aside more funds and earn returns on short-term investments. As of Q1 2024, US corporations increased their cash holdings to an all-time high of $4.11 trillion, driven by a robust economy and relatively high interest rates, which enhanced returns. This represents a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and $1.28 trillion more than pre-pandemic levels. Despite market volatility driven by high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, corporate financial health has remained strong, showing resilience in the first half of the year. According to Bloomberg data, nearly 1 in 10 non-financial companies in the broader market—over 30 firms—earned more in interest income than they spent on debt expenses in the first quarter. While this figure has remained consistent with the previous year, the interest income generated by these companies has increased by approximately 60%. Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy for Bank of America Corp.’s securities business, made the following comment about the situation: “Corporates are earning more money by holding cash. Many companies are comfortable with where the economy is as well as with elevated cash levels because they are getting a return for it.” Wells Fargo suggested that income investors might consider dividend-paying stocks, noting that US large-cap companies have amassed over $2.4 trillion in cash on their balance sheets and could opt to start or increase dividend payouts. Our Methodology: For this article, we began by using a stock screener to find companies with a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio below 15. From this list, we selected companies with a market capitalization of at least $20 billion. Next, we focused on companies with the highest trailing twelve-month operating cash flows, ranking the stocks in ascending order based on their TTM operating cash flows. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Operating Cash Flow (TTM): $4.15 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) ranks sixth on our list of the cash-rich stocks that pay dividends. The American food company specializes in a wide range of snacks and beverages. The company delivered mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024, despite having fallen short of investor expectations since its 2015 merger. In the third quarter of 2024, reported $6.38 billion in revenue, reflecting a 2.85% decline compared to the same period last year. However, the company’s gross profit margin improved by 20 basis points to 34.2%. Kraft Heinz continued to prioritize investments in marketing, research and development, and technology to deliver value-driven solutions for consumers and drive future revenue growth. These efforts are supported by its proven ability to optimize operations and maintain strong cash flow. In addition, the company remains committed to growing its established and emerging food and beverage brands on a global scale. Mairs & Power also highlighted efforts made by The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “We added The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) to the Fund in the quarter. Kraft Heinz is a leading global food company which possesses a portfolio of iconic brands, including its eponymous ketchup brand. The company has been undergoing an operational transformation focused on driving efficiency gains in supply chain, manufacturing and distribution. These efficiency gains have fueled increased investments in technology, automation, innovation and marketing, which should ultimately drive more consistent organic revenue growth and high single digit earnings per share growth. We expect above-average long-term returns, buoyed by consistent free cash flow generation, opportunistic share repurchases and an attractive 4-5% dividend yield. A modest current valuation affords an ample margin of safety.” Income investors can find reassurance in the company’s strong cash position and set aside other concerns. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) reported a solid cash generation in its latest quarter. Year-to-date operating cash flow rose to $2.8 billion, a 6.7% increase from the same period last year. Free cash flow totaled $2 billion, reflecting a 9.7% year-over-year growth. In addition, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends over the first nine months of the year. Currently, it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has an attractive dividend yield of 5.17%, as of December 16. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3 2024. In addition, Arrowstreet Capital increased its stake in the company by 31% during Q3. Overall, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) was included in 38 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database, with a total stake value amounting to over $12 billion. Overall KHC ranks 6th on our list of the cash-rich dividend stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: 2025 Predictions: Bitcoin, Sovereigns & Macro

BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - NOVEMBER 05: In this photo illustration a novelty Bitcoin token is ... [+] photographed on a US Dollar bank note, on November 5, 2023 in Bath, England. Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, cryptocurrency analysts say millions of US dollars has so far been donated to the Ukrainian war effort through anonymous Bitcoin donations, with the Ukrainian government, and many NGOs and volunteer groups all advertising their Bitcoin wallet addresses online. However, fears have also been raised that the use of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, maybe used by the Russian government to circumnavigate the tough economic sanctions that have been imposed. (Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images) There’s a new incoming administration in the U.S. that has promised a lot of changes to the status quo in 2025. Because of this, the global financial ecosystem should look very different by the end of the year. Based on plans that have already been announced, and considering the knock-on effects that they will have, we can start to paint a picture of what that future could look like, and draw some predictions of what is to come. Here are my top 5 Bitcoin and macro predictions for the year ahead, and how they could impact markets: Bitcoin will reach the price equivalent of 50 Oz of gold: Gold currently trades at $2,650/oz, and bitcoin trades at $106,000. At the time of writing, it takes ~40 Oz of gold to buy one bitcoin. I believe bitcoin will continue to appreciate in gold terms, and will reach a price equivalent to 50 oz of gold. At current gold prices, this would equate to a BTC price of $132,500. In other words, Bitcoin will increase in value as measured in gold, not just as measured in dollars. I expect to see a slew of portfolio recommendations coming out of ETF issuers’ research desks and registered investment advisors, recommending a portfolio allocation for bitcoin. Not dissimilar to the one that was recently published by Blackrock. The recent report from Blackrock about bitcoin stated “investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.”. If you are a fully allocated investor looking to rotate into a bitcoin position, you may be inclined to downsize your gold position to make room, as you’re investing the “digital” version of it. At least one G20 country will propose a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: While everyone in the Bitcoin community is rightfully excited about the potential of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, the geopolitical dominos have started falling, and they will continue to fall whether the U.S. pulls the trigger or not. Countries like El Salvador and Bhutan already have bitcoin reserves, and their reserves have appreciated materially over recent years. Healthy financial reserves that are uncensorable and have no counterparty risk means more geopolitical leverage for a nation state. Others will want to replicate this success. There are several recent examples of presidential candidates running on a “Bitcoin” platform in countries like Suriname and Poland, and there’s been Bitcoin Reserves proposals already submitted in countries like Brazil and Japan. I believe at least one more G20 country will announce plans for a Bitcoin Strategic reserve during 2025. Bitcoin Miner Crackdown: As countries begin to understand the strategic significance of stacking bitcoin, they will turn their heads into how it is produced, and will learn that underutilized or underproductive energy sources can be tapped into to generate bitcoin. In parallel, they will look at those currently mining bitcoin domestically for public private partnerships. I expect to see the creation of regulatory bodies to oversee bitcoin mining in several countries. I also expect to see some countries aggressively going after “unregistered” miners that don’t comply with their regime or rules. We saw this happen in Venezuela last year, we could see similar behaviour in other countries throughout 2025. U.S. Dollar Stablecoin Surge: Between Circle and Tether combined, they hold approximately $136 Billion in U.S. debt today, which makes them the 18th largest holder of U.S. debt in the world. USD stablecoins can grow into very large buyers of U.S. debt at a time when the Federal Reserve is desperately looking to deleverage its balance sheet (i.e. they need to sell some of their bond holdings). And they are always looking for buyers to roll over their debt. I expect the Trump administration to recognize this and quickly move to regulate U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins like Circle and Tether to solidify them as a sort of strategic partners that can help the U.S. drive further penetration of the U.S. dollar, and be active buyers of U.S. national debt. This environment should allow for the market capitalization for USD-pegged stablecoins to more than double from ~$200 B today to ~$500 B by the end of 2025. The Euro will trade below par to the USD: There are many layers to this reasoning and prediction, but let’s focus on macro and crypto drivers for now. Generally speaking, the EU is growing at a much slower rate than the U.S. in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) terms. Year to date, the EU has grown by +0.8%, whereas the U.S. has grown by +2.8%. Because of this, analysts predict that the EU will have to cut interest rates more aggressively than the U.S. Federal Reserve during 2025. This will put pressure on the Euro. Further, looking at it from a crypto lens, the highly anticipated MiCA crypto regulatory framework will become active in the EU on December 30th 2024. While there are positives to having regulatory clarity for the industry, along with clear investor and consumer protections for users, the ruleset can be complex and expensive for a young startup to comply with. In parallel, the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. has signalled a pro-crypto shift in the U.S. regulatory bodies, and it has reinvigorated a conversation among founders in the space to relocate back to the U.S. or set up operations in the country. This could draw future innovation and investment from Europe in the crypto sector, adding to further weakness in the Euro. While the Euro has traded above the U.S. dollar over the last 20 years or so, I would not be surprised to see another multi-year period where it trades below the U.S. dollar. That’s my top 5 for 2025. We’ll keep an eye on markets and I’ll be back next December to see how we did! One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Is Jantzi Social Index ETF (XEN) the Best Canadian ETF to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jantzi-social-index-etf-xen-144714907.html
Time Published: 2024-12-18T14:47:14Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Canadian ETFs to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN) stands against other best Canadian ETFs to buy. After a slow start in 2024, the Canadian stock market saw a strong third quarter, fueled by domestic rate cuts and a recovery in global markets. Year-over-year headline inflation has cooled to align with the Bank of Canada’s target rate of 2%. As a result, policymakers have implemented four consecutive rate cuts, with an additional 50 basis point reduction anticipated in December. With the central bank expected to keep cutting interest rates to support the economy, stock market strategists are cautiously optimistic that the rally will continue. In this context, Brent Joyce, chief investment strategist at BMO, shared the following: “The environment is very attractive for equities. It’s been this trifecta of better global growth, interest-rate-sensitive companies themselves, and the interest rate sensitivity of dividends. These were headwinds for the two years that rates were going up, [but they] have flipped into tailwinds for the Canadian stock market now that rates are falling.” While most stocks are influenced by global factors, many companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange are also cyclically driven, meaning their performance is closely tied to the economy and the business cycle. Given the strong connection between the US and Canadian economies, stable growth in the US has provided a boost to Canadian equities. On that front, Tim Hayes, chief global investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, advises clients to allocate 5% of their equity portfolio to Canadian stocks, making it the second-largest weighting after the 69% recommended for US stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index is on track to have its best year since 2009, having set new records 42 times this year and risen 21.09% year-to-date, closely following the S&P 500’s 27.58% gain. Hayes highlighted the broad rally and noted that the market is largely driven by energy and financial stocks, which offer the highest trailing and forward earnings yields, contrasting with the tech sector’s lower yields. On the other hand, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rattled the markets earlier in November with a proposal to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, aimed at addressing drug trafficking and border issues, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China. This decision had an immediate impact on Canada’s energy sector, which experienced a 2.2% decline amid concerns that rising US crude production would meet domestic demand. At the same time, the Canadian dollar dropped to its lowest level against the US dollar since May 2020, sparking worries about potential inflationary pressures on imports. While the future remains uncertain, the Canadian ETF industry, which began with the world’s first ETF launched in Canada in 1990, has shown notable resilience over the past 30+ years, and continued growth is expected in the years to come. Despite the market volatility this year, Canadian ETFs have managed to navigate the challenges effectively and are well-positioned for another strong year. With only a couple of weeks remaining in the year, the industry is on track to surpass the previous annual record of $58 billion set in 2021. Moreover, following recent data from IFIC showing Canadian ETF sales reached their third-best month ever in October, a new report from research firm ETFGI highlights additional gains in November, along with impressive year-to-date figures. The firm reported net inflows of US$7.5 billion in November, slightly down from the C$8.2 billion reported in IFIC’s October report, but still a strong performance that contributes to the 29th consecutive month of net inflows. Our Methodology We have selected the top Canadian ETFs to buy and hold based on their 5-year performance as of December 10, listed in ascending order for clarity. Additionally, we’ve highlighted the top holdings of each ETF to provide valuable insights for potential investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 47.29% The iShares Jantzi Social Index ETF (TSX:XEN), managed by BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited, is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the Jantzi Social Index. The fund focuses on stocks of companies recognized for socially responsible business practices. Over the past year, XEN delivered a total return of 24.93%, with an average annual return of 6.11% since inception, including dividends. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is one of the ETF’s largest holdings. In the third quarter of 2024, the company achieved record-breaking results, producing 863,000 ounces of gold at cash costs of $921 per ounce, meeting its annual projections. The strong performance was driven by operational efficiency and cost control, enabling the company to return approximately $700 million to shareholders and reduce net debt by $1 billion, lowering it to $490 million. Revenue grew by 31% to $2.2 billion, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 64% to $1.26 billion. On November 21, Jefferies initiated coverage of Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), assigning a Hold rating and an $85 price target. The firm praised the company’s robust operational performance, cost management, and high-quality asset portfolio. Additionally, margin expansion is expected as Agnico Eagle develops underground ore sources at its Canadian Malartic and Detour Lake mines, which will provide access to higher-grade materials. Overall, XEN ranks 8th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy. While we acknowledge that XEN, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XEN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A person with a cell phone who is looking for new stocks 5-year Share Price Performance as of December 9, 2024: 45.75% The Fidelity Canadian High Quality ETF (TSX:FCCQ) aims to mirror the performance of the Fidelity Canada Canadian High Quality Index. As of December 9, it holds net assets of $214.4 million and has a management expense ratio of 0.39%. This ETF focuses on equity securities from large- and mid-cap Canadian companies, emphasizing higher-quality profiles compared to the broader Canadian equity market. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) holds the largest position in this Fidelity ETF. On December 4, Loop Capital upgraded the company’s stock from Hold to Buy, citing its innovative use of artificial intelligence to enhance merchant tools and optimize internal operations. The brokerage also raised its price target to $140, representing a 23% potential upside. Loop Capital emphasized that these AI-driven advancements are enabling Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) to grow revenue faster than expenses, improving operating and free cash flow margins. With consistent annual sales growth exceeding 20%, the company is well-positioned to enhance profitability and valuation further. Additionally, Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) reported record-breaking Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) sales of $11.5 billion, a 24% increase from the previous year. This robust performance suggests the company is on track to meet or surpass consensus expectations for fourth-quarter Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growth, currently forecasted at 23.5%. Rowan Street Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) has been an incredibly rewarding investment for those lucky enough to get in early after the company’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2015. The shares have delivered a return of 2,600% or 42% annual. Its revenues have grown at 49% per annum since the end of 2014 from $105 million to estimated $8.6 billion in 2024. The massive e-commerce market is a huge opportunity, as the company’s growth indicates. As you tell from the chart below, revenues are forecasted to grow above 20% for the next 3 years. Keep in mind, Shopify has been around for more than a decade — and it’s still growing at these high rates. Overall, FCCQ ranks 9th on our list of best Canadian ETFs to buy.
