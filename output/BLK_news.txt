Title: China Puts Investor Patience to Test as Key Meeting Underwhelms

(Bloomberg) -- China’s highly anticipated Finance Ministry briefing on Saturday lacked the firepower that equity investors had hoped for, indicating that the volatility that’s gripped the market following a world-beating rally will likely extend. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record While Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised more support for the struggling property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing to shore up the economy, the briefing didn’t produce a headline dollar figure for fresh fiscal stimulus that the markets had sought. A lack of new incentives to boost consumption, which has been a weak link in the economy, is another reason why traders may feel disappointed. The ministry “tried its best,” but there is a large gap between what was announced and what the market was expecting, said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “So the overall sentiment for investors is negative.” Patience has been wearing thin among investors, who have clamored for Beijing to announce big-bang fiscal measures to help sustain the rally sparked by the stimulus blitz that authorities unleashed in late September. The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of onshore equities, capped its biggest weekly loss since late July on Friday, with volatility rising ahead of the MOF briefing. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, proxies for China sentiment among developed market currencies, both slipped 0.2% in early trading Monday. A further unwinding of the rally risks fueling concern that equities are heading for yet another false dawn, which may bring more selling pressure. The market has been caught in a start-stop cycle of gains and losses a few times before as Beijing’s piecemeal approach to stimulus produced only brief rebounds. Local governments will be allowed to issue special bonds to buy unsold homes and turn them into subsidized housing, Lan and his deputies said on Saturday, while refraining from putting a price tag on any additional stimulus. Lan also hinted at room for issuing more sovereign bonds and greater government spending, steps that could be announced later this month or early November. Prior to the weekend, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected China to deploy as much as 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion) in fresh fiscal stimulus on Saturday, including potential subsidies, consumption vouchers and financial support for families with children. “The room for further fiscal stimulus is still on the table,” said Britney Lam, head of long-short equities for Magellan Investments Holdings Ltd. In the meantime, “markets will likely see further profit taking,” she said. Inflation data released on Sunday is likely to add to investor concerns. It showed that China’s consumer prices rose less than forecast in September, while factory-gate charges fell for a 24th straight month, underscoring the need for further policy support to help the economy break out of deflation. The CSI 300 Index slid 3.3% last week, but it’s still up 21% from its close on Sept. 23, the day before China’s central bank announced a broad package of measures that included an interest-rate cut and liquidity support for the equity market. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 6.6% last week after surging more than 30% in the previous three weeks. While the epic rebound in Chinese shares has spurred the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. to upgrade the market, it has also drawn skepticism from others such as Invesco Ltd. and Morgan Stanley who say stocks have already run too far too fast. “I’m still a little bit disappointed,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. While the finance minister announced some specific measures, the ‘timing and amount’ were still missing. What’s Next? Investors will soon turn attention to the next major policy briefing in the coming weeks — from the Communist Party-controlled parliament that oversees the budget — for details of more stimulus. At its October meeting last year, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress approved additional sovereign debt and raised the budget-deficit ratio. China’s sovereign bonds were little changed on the measures announced on Saturday. By noon on the day, the 10-year yield had erased an earlier drop of as much as two basis points, according to traders, who asked not to be identified as they are not allowed to comment publicly on the rates market. A strengthened fiscal push would likely weigh on China’s bonds by encouraging traders to move funds into riskier investments with potentially better returns. An increased supply of debt may also sap liquidity in the financial system, making it harder for the market to absorb the entire amount. The yield curve will probably move lower, given debt issuance this year may come below market consensus, said Zhaopeng Xing, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Going forward, “we expect 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion yuan of local bonds to be announced,” he added. --With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Zhu Lin, Wenjin Lv, Shuiyu Jing, April Ma, Matthew Burgess, Michael G.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

While server artificial intelligence demand remains strong, consumer demand across PCs, smartphones, and auto appears lackluster, the advisory told investors in a research note. Citi cut estimates and, accordingly, lowered price target by 10%. Overall LRCX ranks 16th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Cardano Whales Move $6 Billion In One Day, Fuel For ADA Price To Reach $0.5?

Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:30:36Z

In an interesting move, Cardano (ADA) has rebounded by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, in what seems to be an uptick in activity among large ADA holders. The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

Title: Mark Harmon Explains Why His Son Isn't Returning To Play Young Gibbs On NCIS: Origins
URL: https://screenrant.com/ncis-origins-why-sean-harmon-not-returning-young-gibbs-explained-mark-harmon/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:01:53Z
Full Content:
Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. NCIS: Origins executive producer and narrator Mark Harmon explains why his son, Sean, isn't returning as Young Gibbs. Set to premiere on CBS in just a matter of days, NCIS: Origins is the first prequel in the history of the NCIS franchise. It follows Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the early 1990s. Although Sean Harmon is involved behind the scenes in the new show, he won't be appearing on camera. Instead, Bridge of Spies actor Austin Stowell steps into the lead role. Speaking with Variety, ahead of the premiere of NCIS: Origins on Monday, October 14, at 10 PM ET on CBS, Harmon clarified why Sean won't be reprising his role as Young Gibbs in the prequel. Even though Harmon played Gibbs in the main series, and has been credited with coming up with the pitch for NCIS: Origins, the older Harmon clarified that his son is focused on different things and enjoys executive producing. Read the quote below: “He’s an actor, writer, producer, a surfer, he does a lot of things. You have to come to decisions about what you want to do in life, or what you think’s important. I just think he made a choice and had to make a decision in some ways. He likes executive producing.” The new NCIS prequel puts the spotlight on Gibbs as he's just beginning his career as a Special Agent at NCIS' Camp Pendleton office. He intends to build up a gritty team, with the support of another legacy character, Mike Franks, who has been played in the main show by Muse Watson. It's a different version of Gibbs than the one the franchise viewers will recognize, at least in terms of the NCIS: Origins cast Gibbs is surrounded by. Though there are a few familiar faces, there are several more new ones. NCIS: Origins: Cast & Characters Actor Who They're Playing Notes Austin Stowell Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs The main protagonist of the prequel. Mariel Molino Special Agent Lala Dominguez The female lead and potential love interest for Gibbs. Kyle Schmid Special Agent Mike Franks Leader of the team. Tyla Abercrumbie Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Self-described “Head Secretary in Charge.” Diany Rodriguez Special Agent Vera Strickland Franks' partner in the original NCIS. Daniel Bellomy Special Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson A young probationary agent. Caleb Martin Foote Special Agent Benjamin “Randy” Randolf The agency's lovable golden boy. Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs Gibbs' father. Patrick Fischler NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker Walker oversees the fledgling NIS Pendleton Office. Julian Black Antelope Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock Blackrock works at the San Diego County M.E.’s Office. Lori Petty Dr. Lenora Friedman A pathologist at the San Diego Medical Examiner’s Office. Bobby Moynihan Woodrow “Woody” Browne Director of the NIS Forensic Lab. Mark Harmon Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (as narrator) Also executive producer. In one of his few major acting roles, Sean Harmon appeared in seven episodes of NCIS, appearing in seasons 6, 7, 9, and 18. By bringing in Stowell, the high-profile prequel will honor NCIS continuity. But it will also signal to viewers that this is a somewhat distinct version of Gibbs that won't simply retread the ground that's been covered in flashbacks. It invites viewers in, with one argument being that audiences wouldn't necessarily have to follow the main NCIS to enjoy the prequel. NCIS: Origins recently cast its new Jethro Gibbs, and this casting is all the more exciting considering the actor’s previous action show success. In any case, even though Sean Harmon is not the lead actor, he's very much part of the show's creative team. Mark and Sean share executive producer credits alongside David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal. The latter duo will also co-write the premiere episode and serve as showrunners, joined by those heavily involved in the main NCIS. So, while there may be a different Gibbs at the center of the story, the same writing force and vision are present. Even though the reasons are only implied by Harmon, it takes a lot to be the lead of a high profile series. That's both in terms of the work itself and hours filming, but also things like promotional tours and being the face of the brand. All of this might have contributed to CBS and Sean Harmon wanting to go in a different direction. But it also allows NCIS: Origins a better chance of standing on its own terms. Source: Variety Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks.

Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Finally!!! I’ve been anxiously awaiting this show since its announcement back in January. I hope it lives up to expectations- I’m betting it will! The story continues......no how the story, the legend, the reputation became as respected as He is. Looking forward to the development of how the GIBBS RULES came into being..... especially rules 9 and 12 I have watched every episode on NCIS since the beginning. Can't wait until tomorrow to start watching the new series. Best wishes for a successful Show Arnold Sheir NCIS: Origins showrunners David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal explain how the prequel series will be a darker story compared to the main series. One of the most iconic Thanos stories in Marvel Comics was skipped in the MCU, but Marvel may be setting up a replacement for the Mad Titan. Lee Child's Jack Reacher book series never actually resolved one major question about Neagley, but the Neagley spin-off might finally provide answers. After Transformers One had a disappointing box office debut, the highly-acclaimed movie finally reaches a major global milestone in just three weeks. Adar's death scene was a terrible moment in Rings of Power season 2, but one detail could make his tragic and ironic end even more heartbreaking Like its predecessor, The Platform 2 features several character deaths - while some deaths hold immense narrative significance, others are just brutal The official runtime for Gladiator 2 runs just a few minutes short of Ridley Scott's original 2000 epic movie, which was two hours and 35 minutes.

Title: Troubled retailers face a Halloween crunch with consumers spending less
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/troubled-retailers-face-halloween-crunch-190000616.html
Time Published: 2024-10-12T19:00:00Z

(Bloomberg) -- A predicted slide in Halloween consumption is the latest blow for heavily-indebted retailers battling mounting overheads and the trend of consumers trading down to cheaper products. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record US spending for the holiday will drop by 5% to $11.6 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Sales of greeting cards and costumes are likely to see the greatest decline, a hit to merchants reliant on seasonal splurges in what’s already been a tough year for the industry. Households on the lower end of the income scale are broadly struggling as unemployment has edged higher this year and underlying inflation has remained persistently high. Retailer Michaels Cos. said on a recent earnings call that households earning less than $100,000 are retrenching, resulting in lower basket sizes. “2024 has been a perfect storm for retailers of all stripes,” said Erica Weisgerber, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. “Inflation, high operational costs, and reduced consumer spending have been especially challenging for brick-and-mortar retailers, and online retailers have struggled with steep competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.” Many of the troubled firms, including Michaels and At Home Group Inc., are owned by private equity managers after buyouts during the pandemic proved ill-timed when interest rates rose and inflation crimped household budgets. Home, clothing and hobby retailers dominate the list of distressed retailers because the size of their debt means they lack the liquidity to compete with better capitalized competitors, according to Moody’s Ratings. Still, Michaels and At Home are hopeful that they can win a larger slice of the holiday spending. Hellman & Friedman LLC’s At Home saw a strong start to Halloween spending after flat second-quarter net sales of about $443 million, chief financial officer Jerry Murray said on a September earnings call. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Michaels also saw a revenue pop tied to Halloween as customers began to buy inventory earlier this year, according to people on last month’s earnings call. That’s a fillip for the firm whose earnings declined by about 20% to $50 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Apollo and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. The pullback is creating challenges for the wider industry and has contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies this year, including Joann Inc., Big Lots Inc. and Conn’s Inc. It also makes it harder to turn around firms simply by slashing costs. “Retailers are finding that their low-hanging efficiency efforts do not go far enough,” said Holly Etlin, a partner in AlixPartners’ turnaround practice. With capital markets shunning troubled firms, more retailers turned to bankruptcy rather than distressed exchanges over the past year as the companies require deeper restructuring that is best done in court, Moody’s Ratings said in a report last month. It’s part of a wider trend that saw quarterly filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection rise to the highest level since 2012 in the three months through June. Private equity’s widespread failure to hedge against rising borrowing costs also means it’s less able to come to the rescue of troubled firms, which could have knock-on effects for the economy and jobs. “The private equity players that often have backstopped retailers have been in a new deal lull as multiples collapsed and rates for leveraged deals skyrocketed,” said James Gellert, executive chair at risk analytics provider RapidRatings International Inc. Listen here to the Credit Edge podcast on Schroders’ bullish outlook on CRE private debt Week in Review China’s onshore high-yield debt market this week suffered its worst day of trading in years as investors pulled money out of bonds and poured it into stocks in response to government stimulus. Meanwhile, domestic developer Country Garden Holdings Co. missed a self-imposed target date for getting key creditor support for terms of its restructuring plan. Inflows to private credit funds helped BlackRock Inc. pull in a record $221 billion of total client cash last quarter, bringing the world’s largest money manager to an all-time high of $11.5 trillion of assets. A potential bidding war for HPS Investment Partners is set to swell the fortunes of its three founders as rival groups vie for a piece of the red-hot private credit market. A group of private credit firms including 26North Partners are closing in on a deal to lend to Vista Equity Partners-backed Alegeus Technologies, after the software firm tried to refinance existing debt with a new leveraged loan. Banks led by UBS Group AG sold $1 billion of leveraged loans to help finance Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software company Jaggaer, the market’s latest acquisition deal to include a second-lien component. In Europe, Blackstone Inc. is investing in a C$1.125 billion ($822 million) second-lien tranche that is helping finance AutoScout24’s purchase of Canadian online car marketplace Trader. K2 Insurance Services sold a bigger-than-planned leveraged loan as the firm cuts borrowing costs on buyout-related financing by three percentage points. Verizon Communications Inc. lined up $10 billion of short-term bank funding to help finance its purchase of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. If cut to junk status, Boeing Co. will be the biggest US corporate borrower to ever be stripped of its investment-grade ratings and join junk bond indexes, flooding the high-yield market with a record volume of new debt to absorb. A market for aircraft bonds that all but shut down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is showing signs of life again. Japan’s Norinchukin Bank got a vote of confidence from bond investors on Wednesday, when spreads on the firm’s first dollar issuance since it revealed massive losses tightened significantly in secondary trading. Gritstone Bio Inc., a vaccine developer that once touted its ability to make a next-generation Covid-19 shot, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Avante Health Solutions filed for bankruptcy in order to sell its business to an affiliate of private equity firm Staple Street Capital. On the Move John Abate, partner and co-head of trading at Silver Point Capital, is set to retire by the end of the year after more than 15 years at the hedge fund. Wells Fargo & Co. is hiring Celine Catherin from Deutsche Bank AG as a managing director and co-head of its leveraged syndicate. Joshua Baumgarten, co-managing partner and head of credit at TPG Angelo Gordon, is leaving the firm after its purchase last year by TPG Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has hired Mike Shanahan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director in its technology leveraged finance team. Corinthia Global Management has recruited three more people from Barings after poaching a 22-strong team from the US asset manager earlier this year. The trio are Louis Godest, Christel Huguet and Jan Lübke. JPMorgan Chase & Co. veteran Doug Kravitz joined M3 Partners as a managing director focused on advising company creditors in restructuring scenarios.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Juniper has carved out a niche in the AI sector by taking a broader approach, emphasizing network automation and expanding into various market segments to ensure long-term growth.

Title: BlackRock Is Selling Bitcoin To Buy Ethereum, Will This Bullishness Trigger Another Altcoin Season?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-buy-ethereum/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T17:30:34Z
Full Content:
New reports have revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and American multinational investment company, is now selling Bitcoin (BTC) to buy Ethereum (ETH). Many market watchers propose that this unexpected investment change could trigger a bullish rally for Ethereum, potentially catalyzing another altcoin season. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics tool has uncovered a shocking new transaction executed by asset manager, BlackRock. In its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Lookonchain disclosed that BlackRock has recently sold off 182 BTC, valued at $11.34 million. Around the same period, the blockchain analytics tool recorded BlackRock purchasing 7,574 ETH tokens, worth approximately $18.52 million. This surprising development indicates a potential shift in BlackRock’s investment strategy, hinting at the investment giant’s newfound favor in Ethereum. As the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, BlackRock’s decision to dump Bitcoin for Ethereum comes as a shock to many crypto community members, with discussions flooding the space about the real reason behind the asset manager’s investment decision. According to some market watchers, BlackRock’s move is a reflection of its clients’ digital asset preferences, as the asset manager could be selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum based on client requests. Other crypto community members are seeing BlackRock’s investment move as a sign that the price of Ethereum could be gearing up for a substantial rally. As the number one altcoin in the market with the largest market capitalization, a massive price rally for Ethereum could potentially trigger the long-awaited altcoin season. Historically, a price increase in Ethereum paves the way for other altcoins in the market to see similarly bullish gains. With the market already expecting a significant altcoin season in this bull cycle, BlackRock’s unexpected investment move is fueling speculation in the market about a potential Ethereum price surge that could outperform Bitcoin. As of writing, BlackRock‘s holding reveals a strong preference for Bitcoin in terms of value. Data from Lookonchain reveals that BlackRock holds approximately 369,640 BTC, valued at an impressive $23.02 billion. In comparison, the investment giant Ethereum’s holdings amount to 414,168 ETH, with a value of around $1.01 billion, highlighting a stark difference in the allocation between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Numerous analysts in the crypto market are expressing optimism about the highly anticipated altcoin season. A popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst identified as ‘Moustache’ on X has disclosed that the altcoins season index has been forming a particularly bullish pattern for the past 3.5 years, suggesting that altcoins could be on the verge of a significant price increase. He disclosed that this technical analysis pattern is known as the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” which often indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The analyst is optimistic that the present market downturn will soon be replaced by strong growth in the altcoin market, anticipating an extended period of price gains.

Title: The New Gods Among Us...

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/12/2024 8:50:58 AM PDT by Starman417 In ancient Egypt pharaohs were considered gods. They believed that when a pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them from the beyond, which partially explains why they had such ornate tombs. At roughly the same time, Japanese emperors were similarly thought to be gods, a practice that continued until 1945, when, after the war the emperor was required to explain to his people that he, in fact, was not a god. In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners.

Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe.

Posted on 10/12/2024 8:37:26 AM PDT by george76 The Companies doing the North Carolina Hurricane Helene victim’s home inspections listed on the FEMA website are owned by Vanguard & BlackRock So the same company that owns majority of the lithium mine in the area will be inspecting the victim’s properties they want.. what are the odds! “They want to you don't want to pay attention to this one so who is going to inspect the homes that are damaged or gone in North Carolina well recently brought to me by the American thinker and my brother Mike you sent me the story If you go to the FEMA contract page, you will notice if you search for home inspections, that two companies appear. One is Vanguard and the other one is WSP, who is a Canadian company that is mainly owned by the Canadian pension board.

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season is here, and the US stock market’s furious $9 trillion 2024 rally is facing perhaps its biggest test of the year. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record Strategists are predicting that companies in the S&P 500 Index will post their weakest results in the past four quarters, with just a 4.3% increase in third-quarter profits compared with a year ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. In mid-June, projections were for an 8.4% rise, and in the second quarter growth soared to 14%. Despite the shrunken expectations, the S&P 500 hit another record high on Friday and is up 22% in 2024, its best start to a year since 1997. Investors who keep bidding up stock prices may be onto something, because there appears to be room for an upside earnings surprise if those reduced forecasts turn out to be overly gloomy. It happened in the first quarter, when expectations were for 3.8% growth and it turned out to be 7.9%. “Analysts lowered EPS estimates more than is typical heading into reporting, which could lead to an elevated beat rate and better equity performance across the quarter,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. Earnings season unofficially kicked off on Friday, led by financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. More key companies will deliver results next week, including Citigroup Inc., Netflix Inc. and JB Hunt Transport Services Inc. Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in: AI Slows Down The bulk of the growth in S&P 500 earnings continues to come from the big-technology companies that are seen as major beneficiaries from the development of artificial intelligence. The so-called Magnificent Seven firms — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post an 18% rise in profits in the third quarter. Their issue is the rate of increase is slowing, down from more than 30% in 2023, according to BI. For the rest of the S&P 500, profits are expected to climb 1.8% in the July-September period, which would be their second straight quarterly increase, albeit barely, BI data show. They posted 9.1% growth in the second quarter. That said, profits for the S&P’s “other 493” firms are projected to accelerate substantially from here, with double-digit gains anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, according to data compiled by BI. ‘Stock Picker’s Paradise’ Investors should expect some major swings in individual stocks that don’t show up in the broader index. The options market is pricing in the biggest average post-results implied move at the single-stock level since 2021, when Bank of America Corp. started collecting the data. But implied volatility at the index level is relatively muted, a sign that this earnings season could be a “stock picker’s paradise,” the firm’s strategists including Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors — technology, communication services and health care — are expected to post profit expansions of more than 10%. The energy group, on the other hand, is expected to report a decline of more than 20%. The sector saw the biggest decline in profit estimates among 11 industry groups as crude prices plunged last quarter, according to BI chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. All About Margins Wall Street pros will be closely watching profit margins, which is a key measure of how effective companies have been at squeezing earnings out of their sales. Net-income margins are expected to slip to about 12.9%, less than the 13.1% reported in the second quarter but slightly higher than 12.8% in the third quarter of 2023, data compiled by BI show. The mild dip reflects the challenges some firms face in passing on input costs to costumers as wage pressures remain sticky in several low-productivity industries that are difficult to automate. Profit margins are going to be the weakest for energy and real estate stocks, BI data show. But looking more broadly, they’re expected to rebound in the coming quarters. Choppy European Markets In Europe, this earnings season could mark a turning point for the Stoxx 600 Index, which is hovering near record highs. Analysts cut profit estimates going into the third quarter, with a Citigroup index showing downgrades outnumbering upgrades since mid-June. Meanwhile, regional economies are seeing anemic growth, and manufacturing powerhouse Germany has forecast a contraction for a second year. While the reduced earnings estimates lower the bar for companies to beat expectations, forecasts for 2025 remain high and any guidance on weakening consumer demand would force them to come down, which would spill over into stock prices. A slew of high-profile companies, including Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB and Volkswagen AG, have issued profit warnings in recent weeks. And a stunted recovery in China is likely to weigh on earnings at luxury goods makers such as LVMH. Election Focus With the US presidential election only weeks away, investors will be listening for mentions of economic and trade policy risks and other political issues from corporate executives. About 110 companies mentioned the word “election“ in their second-quarter earnings calls, up 62% from four years ago, BofA data show. History suggests that corporate investment activity accelerates after US presidential elections, which may be a catalyst for companies to unleash capital in the quarters ahead, particularly given lower interest rates, according to BofA’s Kwon. But it also may be delaying some expansion plans and other expenditures. “So much of the capital investment these days is AI related, and the election is not likely to curb that much, if at all,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “However, now that we’re so close to the election, some of the more traditional capital commitments are likely to be delayed due to the political uncertainty.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) The Robotaxi Verdict Is In—And Wall Street Is Taking the Train Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money? ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Mutual fund houses are rushing to load their armoury with passive funds before the pure play passive fund focused Jio Financial-Blackrock combine launch its business soon. In last nine months, 87 passive schemes were launched against 51 in the whole of last year. Mop-up through passive funds have more than doubled to ₹7,472 crore in September quarter against ₹3,415 crore in the previous two quarters (March and June) put together, according to AMFI data. The number of issuance was also substantially higher at 39 in September quarter against 18 NFOs in June quarter and 30 in March quarter. Capital market regulator SEBI gave in-principal approval to the new player launch mutual fund business subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and also notified MF Lite regulations. After promising to deliver alpha in actively managed funds, MFs are wooing investors with innovative smart beta passive funds instead of index tracking plain vanilla funds. Passive funds launched by large fund houses such as HDFC MF, Nippon MF, Birla MF and Tata MF have become an instant hit with investors. The fund houses either pick up top 10 or 30 stocks of a popular index to deliver smart beta. Tata MF has launched one of its kind Tata Nifty Capital Markets Index Funds. The newly introduced Nifty Capital Market index will consist of 20 companies from Nifty 500 index. Nippon Life India Asset Management recently launched Nifty 500 Equal Weight Index Fund and Nifty 500 Momentum 50 Index Fund. Tata MF launched a passive tourism fund, while DSP MF came out with a fund that invests only in top-10 companies of Nifty index. Investing in concentrated index funds will carry higher risk though it can deliver better return in a bull market. Anand Vardarajan, Chief Business Officer, Tata Asset Management said the country is witnessing a shift particularly among new generation who are not going to yesteryear savings vehicles but considering financial markets for investment. Investors should not be perturbed by the recent fall in market when they are investing for next five years as it is very natural for markets to move up or come down a bit, he added. Anil Ghelani, CFA, Head of Passive Investments, DSP MF said, investor interest is steadily increasing and financial advisors are also finding it useful to include passive funds in their recommendations. “Passive fund carries the risk of the underlying index it aims to track and the risks associated with broader equity markets,” he said.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $245 price target. The advisory has a high level of confidence that consumers will use Amazon's services more in the future. It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities. Overall AMZN ranks 1st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

October 12, 2024 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz The weekend is here! Pour yourself a mug of Los Brasiles coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads: • Mossad’s pager operation: Inside Israel’s penetration of Hezbollah: New details emerge of Israel’s elaborate plan to sabotage Hezbollah communications devices to kill or maim thousands of its operatives. (Washington Post) • How to win a Nobel prize: What subjects have past winners studied? What age were they when they won? Where do they live? Nature crunched the data on every science prizewinner to find out. (Nature) see also ‘You mean I have to stop my experiment?’ Not all Nobel laureates react the way you might expect: Adam Smith has spent 18 years recording the moments after the world’s brightest minds receive a life-changing call from the Nobel Prize committee. They might still be in bed when the call comes. But all Nobel Prize winners receive a phone call to break the big news to them. Then, moments after they hang up, their phone rings again. The man on the other end of the line is Adam Smith. (BBC) • Do Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street Run the World? (Spoiler: No) In this blog post, I will explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s “ownership” of the stock market is not an elaborate scheme to control the world. However, I will also discuss why their ownership may still be concerning for other reasons. To begin, let’s explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s ownership of U.S. stocks is not the true definition of ownership. (Of Dollars and Data) • McDonald’s Macarons: How U.S. fast food took over the world — and then went local. (The Dial) • How Everyone Got Lost in Netflix’s Endless Library: Ten years after Silicon Valley remade TV, it’s become clear how the streaming revolution distorted our collective viewing habits — and sense of the culture. (New York Times) • The Most Sought-After Travel Guide Is a Google Doc: Although Google Docs and Maps are simple to share, the creators who spend years perfecting their magnum opus docs are often selective about who gets access. (Thrillist) • Age of Invention: The Coal Conquest: It’s long bothered me as to why coal became so important in Britain. It had sat in the ground for millennia, often near the surface. Near Newcastle and Sunderland it was often even strewn out on the beaches. Yet coal had largely only been used for some very specific, small-scale uses. It was fired in layers with limestone to produce lime, largely used in mortar for stone and brick buildings. And it had long been popular among blacksmiths, heating iron or steel in a forge before shaping it into weapons or tools. (Age of Invention) • Russia’s First Secret Influence Campaign: Convincing the U.S. to Buy Alaska: Russia has been peddling influence for a long time, using a playbook that it still uses today. (Politico) • Ant geopolitics: Over the past four centuries quadrillions of ants have created a strange and turbulent global society that shadows our own. (Aeon) • A Rodeo Doctor Fixes Much More Than Broken Bones: Injuries are inevitable in the world of bull riding. Enter Tandy Freeman, the only physician some cowboys ever see. (Texas Monthly) Be sure to check out our Masters in Business interview this weekend — Live from FutureProof in Huntington Beach, California! — with Joe Lonsdale of 8VC. He is a successful serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist, co-founded Palantir Technologies, founded Adapar, a wealth management platform, and Opto, a private market investment platform.

Title: Miriam Lord’s week: ‘More haste, less speed’ makes for an apt slogan as election fever symptoms erupt
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2024/10/12/miriam-lords-week-more-haste-less-speed-makes-for-an-apt-slogan-as-election-fever-symptoms-erupt/

Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain. Our politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: We have a problem with squirrels in our garden. What can we do to keep them at bay?

Q: We have a problem with grey squirrels in our city garden. They are digging in the beds and causing damage to some of the plants. Any tips on how to keep them at bay? RL, Blackrock, Dublin A: As charming as their arboreal acrobatics might be to watch, grey squirrels can be a real problem in Irish gardens, stripping bark from broad-leaf trees, raiding birds’ nests, burrowing into lawns and digging up flower bulbs. They also feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, tender shoots and flower buds and act as a vector for diseases such as squirrel pox virus which can kill the smaller native red squirrel in a matter of weeks. They are also known to sometimes overwinter in the attics of houses where they can cause considerable damage by chewing through wires and pipework and ripping up insulation as well as contaminating water tanks. Classed as an invasive species, they were first introduced into Ireland in 1911. Thankfully the spread of their natural predator the pine marten in recent years has acted as a curb on numbers. But in urban areas where the pine marten hasn’t gained much of a foothold, grey squirrels are still common. How to best manage them? I know of one Dublin gardener who tried trapping them in a baited cage before releasing them into the wild. But this is not recommended, not least because they breed so prolifically that it would barely put a dent in their numbers but also because it could potentially threaten red squirrel populations. Bird feeders are an obvious draw, so make sure to use squirrel-proof models that prevent them from easily raiding them for food. Recently planted flower bulbs are another, for which reason seasoned gardeners often like to plant theirs under a protective layer of fine mesh chicken wire concealed beneath the surface of the soil of compost. Alternatively, they can be planted into an aquatic basket (the kind used for pond plants) covered with a layer of chicken wire and then planted into the ground. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your home for any small gaps in the eaves and/or soffit boards that could allow them entry, especially at this time of year when they are searching for a sheltered place in which to overwinter. These should be blocked up with a fine-gauge wire mesh (16 gauge, no more than 25mm size). But even with these measures, I’m afraid that they are likely to continue to be a problem.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.

A leading semiconductor chip on a computer robot arm, reflecting the technology advances of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) architects, develops, and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies for semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers. Arm Holdings stock hits all the right notes for AI investors. It has a high historical revenue growth rate of 18% and analysts expect this growth to accelerate moving forward to 22% annually. These numbers are supported by strong license and royalty revenue, as well as increasing adoption of the chip architecture of the firm that competes on cost and energy efficiency. Daiwa recently upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target, noting that following a few interesting and volatile quarters, the bad news of a possible recession was out, and tech was settling post the big recent selloff, though AI expectations were still strong. The advisory expected Arm shares to trend further upwards in the next few months. Overall ARM ranks 22nd among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Letters: Key workers in our capital should get first dibs on any below market-cost rentals

Gardaí are among the key workers facing soaring rents in Dublin. Photo: Getty John Coleman, CEO of the Land Development Agency will appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) next week to confirm the building of 17,000 new homes in the coming years. These homes will be rented at €1,000 below market rent. Wonderful and welcome news, as we all have a responsibility to look after the least well-off. Unfortunately, there was not one word about how our key workers can no longer afford to live in Dublin. Dublin is one of the few developed capital cities in the world that does not pay “weighting allowances” to retain key workers. We are educating them in the thousands to emigrate. No city can function properly without key workers, and if this problem is not addressed then Dublin and Ireland will suffer both socially and economically in the future. Many will argue that the rot has already set in and point to the scarcity of gardaí, teachers and nurses. Will any member of the PAC have the courage to ask Mr Coleman if the billions being spent on housing by the Government do anything to solve the rental crisis for key workers in Dublin? We need key workers more than they need us. Paschal Taggart, Rathgar, Dublin 6 One notes that Trinity College Dublin has renamed the Berkeley Library after the Irish poet Eavan Boland. This has come about after years of campaigning from students and staff as a way of celebrating those who use these buildings. It’s important to remember that George Berkeley – Anglo-Irish philosopher, bishop and cannabis user – was a slave owner as well as being a vocal proponent of this egregious trade. I found it incredulous that Ireland’s most celebrated philosopher was extremely flawed and fallible. Trinity College never had any buildings named after women until now. This indicates to me a college that is modernising itself in meeting with the challenges of today. It would be true to say progress is slow, but the arc of history always bends towards justice. I am delighted this renaming has occurred, as it is important that we always acknowledge the students who use these buildings. What the renaming brings up for me is that there is no tradition too sacred to question. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary This week has underscored the devastating impact of our current economic model on nature. The World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report reveals a calamitous decline in wildlife populations since 1970, with ecosystems like the Amazon and coral reefs nearing collapse (‘Tipping point near as wildlife populations down 73pc in 50 years’, Irish Independent, October 10). These ecosystems are vital for our climate, but also our food and health. At the same time, the report warned of potential “social collapse” from climate change, with regions becoming uninhabitable and millions at risk. Yet there is hope. Both reports stress that reversing this damage is still possible with radical, urgent changes in our economics, politics, behaviour and assumptions. Change starts with each of us. By acting locally, uniting with others and demanding accountability from the powerful, we can spark the wider transformation needed to protect the planet. Hans Zomer, Global Action Plan As a tillage farmer reaching Irish climate change targetsyears earlier than the target set by our Government, I do have to ask how is that we have to use Irish cream from Irish cows to make Irish cream liquors, yet there is no mention where the grain has to come from to make our world-famous Irish whiskeys? The technical file covering both liquors and whiskey was drafted by our Department of Agriculture and I have to ask why is the imbalance in the two agricultural sectors – tillage and dairy – in favour of dairy? Why not protect the tillage sector in an equal fashion? In a world of climate change, where I believe I produce a near net-zero carbon footprint product, where is the support from the Government for me and my fellow tillage farmers? The Irish tillage sector has by far the lowest greenhouse gas emissions compared to other agricultural sectors, according to state body Teagasc. Bobby Miller, Stradbally, Co Laois I must disagree with Larry Dunne that “banning mobile phones in schools is just another excuse for teachers to assert control” (Letters, Irish Independent, October 10). Teachers do need to have control in their classrooms and I don’t believe any excuses are needed. A smartphone is not just a phone, it is also a camera, a calculator and a computer. Schools are well equipped with calculators and computers, so there is no need for smartphones in classrooms. A camera is not necessary in classrooms, either, and in my opinion smartphones should not be allowed in schools at all, as they can be used as tools of intimidation and bullying of both students and teachers. Most of all, phones are a distraction to students who can hear message alerts if they have them in their schoolbags. Marion Dermody, Co Kildare Ciara Kelly’s excellent comment article (‘Acts of abuse by trusted educators have devastating impacts reaching far beyond the boys who were the actual victims of these vile men’, Irish Independent, October 7) brought back some very unpleasant buried memories of my eight years boarding in Willow Park and Blackrock College in the 1960s. One such memory was the priest who chased us around the fields of Willow Park trying to hit us on the bum with his biffer – a short, thick leather strap. I actually remember running so hard as I knew being hit by this vile object was extremely painful. ​ Brian Mc Devitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) AI Wins XCelent Advanced Technology 2024 Award Following $80 Million Amelia Acquisition, Forecasts $150 Million in Combined Revenue by 2025

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

(NASDAQ:SOUN) develops independent voice artificial intelligence solutions that enables businesses across automotive, TV, and IoT, and to customer service industries to deliver high-quality conversational experiences to their customers. The company recently announced that the Amelia conversational AI platform it markets had received the XCelent Advanced Technology 2024 Award from research and advisory firm Celent. Back in August, SoundHound had purchased Amelia in a $80 million deal. It said the combined revenue for the two firms in 2025 was expected to exceed $150 million, with Amelia contributing over $45 million in recurring AI software revenue, plus other non-software revenues such as professional services and agent-related fees. Overall SOUN ranks 33rd among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOUN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s AUM Soars to $11.5 Trillion with Q3 Gains of $160 Billion

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has seen its asset under management (AUM) surge by a whopping $160 billion during the third quarter of the year, to now have a record-breaking $11.5 trillion in AUM. According to a recent Bloomberg report, investors were particularly drawn to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings – which include a spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) – investing $97 billion in these funds. Additionally, fixed-income investments saw a significant influx of $63 billion, leading the company’s year-to-date inflows to $360 billion, a figure that surpasses its total net flows seen in both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has garnered an impressive $360 billion in net inflows year-to-date, surpassing its total net flows for both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has further solidified its position as a one-stop shop for investments by completing the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The deal added $116 billion in private market assets to BlackRock’s portfolio, which has also seen strong demand for cash management and money-market funds, attracting $61 billion in net flows during the quarter. The firm’s growth has been fueled by a favorable market environment, with a surge in stocks and increasing investor interest in fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index’s ‘unstoppable’ rise so far this year and expectations for a less aggressive Federal Reserve rate hike have contributed to this positive trend. BlackRock’s financial performance saw its adjusted net income per share rise 5% to $11.46 and revenue 15% to $5.2 billion. Its market-leading spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinGlass data, currently has around $17.2 billion of assets under management, far above its closest competitors, Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC, which have $13.1 billion and $9.9 billion in AUM, respectively.

Financial powerhouses including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock reported strong earnings on Friday, sending shares soaring and Wall Street into new record territory. U.S.: Tesla keeps Nasdaq in check while Dow and S&P set recordsThe S&P 500 set another new record, its second this week, climbing 0.61% Friday on positive earnings and producer price index data. Same goes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 0.97% to close at another all-time high. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had to contend with Tesla shares tumbling after the launch of the Cybercab. Europe: U.S. data has ripple effect, sending stocks upEuropean stocks hovered early Friday but closed up, with the UK’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.19% and the STOXX Europe 600 at 0.55% on positive earnings reports from big banks on Wall Street. The markets had a lot to digest Friday, including a stimulus briefing planned in Beijing and France’s new draft budget. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefingA day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise on the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Banks Compensate for Drop by Tesla as More Records Fall

US stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The Dow rose 409.74 points, or 1%, to 42,863.86, a record. The S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.6%, to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week. The Nasdaq rose 60.89 points, or 0.3%, to 18,342.94, held down by Tesla's slide. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, the AP reports. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other factors. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. That was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation's largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, though the pace is modest "given that market levels are at least slightly inflated." BlackRock rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the "Cybercab," potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. (More Wall Street stories.)

U.Today - American multinational investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has extended its lead as the world’s dominant asset manager with an $11.5 trillion Asset Under Management (AUM) milestone. As revealed in its third-quarter earnings report, the company said its AUM jumped $2.4 trillion year-over-year, driven by net inflows of $456 billion and positive market movements. This product marked a complete pivot for BlackRock, a traditionally conservative firm. In line with its adoption of Bitcoin, CEO Larry Fink is now one of the major advocates of the digital currency. With the AUM boost, it remains unclear what the firm plans for its iShares Bitcoin Trust product overall. While the Bitcoin ETF is BlackRock's flagship and most popular crypto product, BlackRock is also fully invested in iShares Ethereum Trust, the ETH ETF. Despite the generally poorer performance of Ethereum ETF products, BlackRock remains in the lead among issuers overall. With the massive uptick in BlackRock AUM, it may be inferred that Bitcoin and Ethereum contributed significantly to this new milestone. As a regulated investment outfit, BlackRock is combining a conservative approach with new tech adoption. As such, its current capital base might encourage it to take more calculated risks in the coin moving forward. Despite BlackRock's stance, not all rivals share its vision for Bitcoin. Firms like Vanguard have specifically issued a highly publicized disclaimer that it will not get involved with Bitcoin, or crypto in general. This article was originally published on U.Today

Shares of BlackRock (BLK) hit an all-time high Friday after the investment firm easily topped financial estimates and posted records for assets and inflows. The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.46, with revenue increasing 14.9% year-over-year to $5.20 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $10.38 and $5.02 billion, respectively. BlackRock's assets under management (AUM) rose $2.4 trillion to $11.5 trillion, and net inflows came in at $221 billion, both all-time highs. The company explained that the big jump in revenue came from "the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees." Chief Executive Officer CEO Larry Fink said, "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working." He noted that the firm was driving "access to the enormous investment potential of infrastructure, especially to support AI innovation." Fink added that "the opportunities ahead of us have never been greater." BlackRock shares recently rose 3% to $983.28 after earlier touching a record $995.99. They are up more than 20% year-to-date.
