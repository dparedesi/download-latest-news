The Movistar arena in the Villa Crespo neighborhood of Buenos Aires seats approximately 15,000 people, and on October 6, virtually all of them were clapping, chanting, or otherwise grooving to a steady soundtrack of American rock classics: “Highway to Hell” by AC/DC, “Paint it Black” by the Rolling Stones, and “Bad to the Bone” by George Thorogood and the Destroyers, to name a few. At one point, the crowd spontaneously broke into the wave; at another, they held their phones aloft as though they were Zippos or Bic lighters. But these people were not here to catch the last gasps of Guns N’ Roses or the ageless funk-metal act Living Colour, both of which will be performing in the capital in the coming months. Instead, they had come for the launch of former television personality and current Argentine President Javier Milei’s newest book, La Construcción del Milagro (The Construction of the Miracle). Shortly before 9 p.m., more than half an hour after Milei was scheduled to take the stage, the lights went out, and an excited hum fell over the arena. A series of videos were projected on the more than 2,000 square foot screen above the main stage. The first displayed a man in profile blowing a giant shofar. This eventually gave way to scenes of violent destruction: buildings collapsing in controlled demolitions, wildfires, and even nuclear explosions. Finally, the drums of the Argentine rock band La Renga kicked in, and Milei began wending his way to the stage through a mob of adoring supporters, his mere presence igniting chants of “Li-ber-tad!” By the time he clambered onstage, he seemed out of breath, but that didn’t stop him from belting out the chorus to the song “Panic Show.” Por favor no huyan de miYo soy un rey de un mundo perdidoSoy el rey y te destrozaréTodos los cómplices son de mi apetito. There’s no use runningI am the king of a lost worldI am the king, and I will destroy youI have an appetite for accomplices. With his trademark black leather jacket, thick sideburns, and pallid complexion, he had the affect of a slightly manic vampire. Nearly two years after vowing to demolish the Argentine political caste and take a chain saw to the country’s bureaucracy, both Milei and his administration find themselves at a crossroads. In September, the Argentine Central Bank was forced to sell $1.1 billion in reserves over 72 hours to backstop the country’s plummeting currency and keep its value beneath 1,475.32 pesos to the dollar—then the outer limit of a floating exchange rate established as part of an April arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. While certain economic indicators have since improved, faith in Milei’s radical libertarian experiment has begun to falter. October polling from Zuban Córdoba & Associates found that more than 64 percent of the population now disapproves of the government thanks to an increased cost of living alongside steep social spending cuts. A string of corruption scandals involving cryptocurrencies, illicit payments, and alleged narcos hasn’t helped much, either. All of these attendant shocks have already begun to drag down the president’s electoral coalition, La Libertad Avanza, or LLA, which recently suffered a double-digit loss to its Peronist opposition in Buenos Aires’s bellwether provincial elections. With midterms scheduled for October 26, the U.S. Treasury Department has put its talon on the scales by promising a historic bailout if Milei stays the course. Yet several weeks after announcing its negotiations with Argentine officials, the Trump administration’s true motivations remain opaque even as the instability of the country’s economy—and its self-described anarcho-capitalist leader—have never been clearer. Here in his second term, Donald Trump appears to be pursuing a foreign policy rooted in the original Monroe Doctrine, in which Latin America falls under the sphere of influence of the United States. After a failed attempt to overthrow Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro during Trump’s first term, the U.S. military, under the direction of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has launched extrajudicial airstrikes on several boats off Venezuela’s coastline that the administration claims, spectacularly, are transporting fentanyl and other drugs. These strikes have killed more than 20 and destroyed at least one Colombian vessel, according to the nation’s president, Gustavo Petro. On Wednesday, Trump ratcheted up his pressure campaign, acknowledging that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert action inside Venezuela’s borders. For Juan Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at Torcuato di Tella University in Buenos Aires, these acts and the administration’s eagerness to support the Milei government fit a larger pattern. “You have two governments in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago that are part of a diplomatic encirclement of Venezuela,” Tokatlian told The New Republic. “The United States already has control of [Nayib] Bukele in El Salvador, [Daniel] Noboa in Ecuador, and Santiago Peña in Paraguay. The governments of Peru, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Panama, and the Dominican Republic are all ready to cooperate with the United States. The center left is underwater in Chile and Colombia, and then you have the most important election in Brazil next October. “If all four South American governments were to swing right,” says Tokatlian, “then the United States would find the entire hemisphere in its power again. That’s why it’s so important for Trump that Milei and his economic model succeed.” What exactly this means in practical terms has yet to be defined, but Argentina offers a few clues. On September 30, less than a week after agreeing to Trump’s bailout, the Argentine president signed an executive order allowing 30 officers from the elite U.S. maritime unit the Naval Special Warfare Command to carry out exercises alongside Argentine forces at three separate bases in Mar del Plata, Puerto Belgrano, and Ushuaia, the closest city to the Antarctic continent. Tokatlian contends this is part of a broader effort to decouple Argentina from China, which operates a space station in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, and has an agreement to build a Hualong One nuclear reactor in Buenos Aires. Still, he and others remain skeptical that Trump will succeed on that front, in part because Beijing remains Argentina’s second-largest trade partner behind only Brazil. “I struggle to see the geopolitical strategy here,” said Michael Paarlberg, an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University and the Latin America adviser to Bernie Sanders during the 2020 Democratic primary. “Argentina is not a top trade partner of the United States, doesn’t send a lot of migrants its way, and isn’t a pass-through country, obviously. And if the Trump administration were really concerned about China, it wouldn’t be pissing off Brazil, which is the region’s largest economy.” (Trump has revoked the visas of six Brazilian judicial officials and imposed sanctions against the wife of Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, following the conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro for an attempted coup. He has also placed a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian goods, although talks with his presidential counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are ongoing.) “This is Trump picking favorites with individual leaders who share his ideology and kiss his ass, frankly. But maybe kissing Trump’s ass is the smart move for Milei. When your country is one of the largest sovereign debtors in the world, you have limited cards to play.” Irma Gamarra waited patiently outside the Movistar Arena two hours before the book event and vanity rock concert. A gaunt woman of 42, with raven hair and a matching black bubble coat, she made the 90-minute flight from Corrientes with her husband to support the right wing populist. Previously, she claimed, she had voted for “Kirchnerismo,” a progressive political coalition spearheaded by President Néstor Kirchner and later his wife and successor Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently serving six years under house arrest for graft. After years of “political devastation,” however, Gamarra acknowledged she was drawn to Milei’s “futuristic” economic model. “We need to move away from social assistance,” she said. “This country has made a mess of public spending.” For more than a year now, dozens, if not hundreds, of retirees have faced down an increasingly violent police force in front of Congress each Wednesday to protest skyrocketing medical costs and pensions that have fallen below the breadline across multiple administrations. In August, Milei vetoed a congressional vote that would have raised the minimum monthly payment of 384,305 pesos, which includes a 70,000-peso bonus, by 7.2 percent. That’s between $270 and $290, depending on the exchange rate. “In my generation, there are a lot of retirees who have never contributed anything in their lives,” Gamarra continued. “They have a lot to think about.” As for the corruption charges that have followed the Milei administration, she argued they were the work of his political enemies and that his inner circle had failed to “protect him.” “I have no doubts about my president,” she added. “That’s why I support him. That’s why I believe. That’s why we need to eliminate the deficit.” On February 14, at approximately 7 p.m. Buenos Aires time, Milei issued a curious post on the social media platform X promoting a digital coin called $LIBRA. Claiming the coin was linked to a “private project,” the president promised that its purchase would “stimulate the growth of the Argentine economy by funding small businesses and local startups.” Within the hour, the token’s value shot up to $5.54 as its market capitalization reached $4.5 billion. Then came the rug pull. In a matter of minutes, $LIBRA fell to $1.44 as initial investors cashed out, eventually costing traders more than $250 million. Alternately dubbed crypto- and $LIBRA-gate, the scandal has prompted two lawsuits in New York and Argentina—the first accusing Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis of RICO violations, and the second involving the president, two of his business associates, former adviser to Argentina’s National Securities Commission Sergio Morales, and Milei’s sister, Karina, who serves as secretary general in his administration. In separate reports from La Nación and CoinDesk, an outlet that focuses on the trading of digital currencies, Davis reportedly bragged of Milei, “I control that n****. I send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does whatever I want.” Karina Milei is no stranger to this kind of malfeasance. Nicknamed by her adoring brother “el jefe,” the masculine term for “the boss,” Karina found herself at the center of a local media firestorm in late August when leaked audios of National Disability Agency head Diego Spagnuolo accused her of accepting bribes from medical and pharmaceutical companies totaling between $500,000 and $800,000 monthly in exchange for state contracts. The administration responded by firing Spagnuolo and issuing a media embargo on the recordings that it later lifted under pressure by organizations like Amnesty International and the Argentine Journalism Forum. “To the extent that such a thing exists, the first family is not normal,” offered Juan Luis Gonzalez, a journalist and the author of the Milei biography El Loco. “We’re talking about a president who claims he can communicate with his dead dog in the afterlife. Both he and his sister suffered terrible trauma at the hands of their parents, but especially Javier, who was incredibly lonely as a child. “Karina has an emotional monopoly over her brother, and this invariably leads to trouble,” he continued. “She will torpedo his friendships and even his romantic relationships. But if Javier has a messianic complex, his sister has a voracious appetite for money that leads her to dip her hand in the cookie jar time and again. This happened when Milei was a member of Congress and has continued in La Casa Rosada.” Although the latest corruption allegations against Karina are among the most high-profile, they are hardly the only ones that have been levied against LLA. Earlier this month, José Luis Espert, a national deputy representing Buenos Aires province, was forced to scuttle his reelection bid after it was revealed that he had accepted a $200,000 payment from accused drug trafficker and money launderer Federico Machado. Both Milei and Espert insist that the charges are part of a political operation against their movement, and the latter maintains that “time will show we are not all the same.” Adding insult to political injury, the National Election Board has since denied an LLA request to reprint its paper ballots for Buenos Aires, meaning that Espert’s name will remain on the ticket when voters head to the polls later this month. If the president was at all concerned that night about his country’s sinking economy, or his coalition’s slumping electoral prospects, he kept his cards close to his heaving chest. Indeed, he was downright ebullient as he tore through Argentine rock anthems like “El Rock del Gato” by Los Ratones Paranoicos and “Blues del Equipaje” by La Mississippi. Singing back up and skipping around onstage to a rhythm mostly their own were LLA Deputy Lilia Lemoine, a onetime Manga and Marvel cosplayer, and Ana Tamagno, an aspiring congresswoman and the wife of Milei’s presidential biographer, Marcelo Duclós. On the drums was another LLA deputy, Alberto “Bertie” Benegas Lynch, a libertarian who has advocated for privatizing the ocean. Long before pursuing a career in politics, Milei sang in a Rolling Stones cover band called Everest, and his sense of showmanship is undeniable. Midway through his set, he declared that the evening was “missing some fire,” which in turn triggered several onstage pyrotechnics. Amid several audible gasps from the audience, he then launched into “Dame Fuego” by Sandro, Argentina’s campy answer to Elvis Presley during the 1960s and 1970s. If you squinted—hard—you might even convince yourself you were watching an actual arena rock show, replete with a preening lead singer and his fiendish femme cohorts. Reality intruded with a rendition of “Hava Nagila.” Written in 1918 by the Jewish composer Abraham Zevi Idelsohn, the folk song is traditionally performed at weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other celebrations. Milei, an ardent supporter of Israel and a would-be convert to Judaism, who has compared his struggle to that of the ancient Maccabees, opted instead to use it as a tribute to the victims of Hamas on October 7, 2023. After previously singing along to Sandro, the crowd fell mostly silent, baffled by the Hebrew lyrics their president was shouting at them over the band. Between these performances, the event’s organizers projected a pair of confounding compilation videos. The first featured an ecstatic-bordering-on-weepy Milei embracing a series of celebrities and dignitaries that included Sylvester Stallone, Elon Musk, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Donald Trump himself. The second included a montage of images and scenes from conservative Charlie Kirk’s final public appearance at Utah State University—a video that culminated in close-range footage of his gruesome assassination. As Kirk lurched back and bled out on-screen, the audience erupted in a show of support for the fallen Turning Point USA director. Milei’s final number of the evening was a cover of Charly Garcia’s “Tu Vicio,” a song about how we’re unable to quit our own vices. The Argentine head of state then announced to the LLA faithful that he needed to take a break so that he could “bathe” and “look like a president.” During the intermission, Milei’s fans made their way to the aisles. Several concession stands in the lower bowl had run out of hamburger patties earlier in the evening, so attendees dined on pink panchos con papas fritas—foot-long hotdogs topped with miniature french fries. At different gates were book stands with titles like El Libro Negro de la Nueva Izquierda (The Black Book of the New Left) by Nicolas Marquez and Agustín Laje and Como Fabricar Una Feminista … (How to Make a Feminist …) by the Brazilian reactionary Sara Winter Huff. Each featured piles upon piles of Milei’s latest, whose cover photo displayed the president pouting over a chain saw with the inscription “las fuerzas del cielo” (“the forces of heaven”)—a reference to both his followers and the mystical powers with which he claims to govern. Published by Hojas del Sur, which bills itself as the publishing house of Argentina’s culture war, the book’s flap copy boasts that readers will learn the “recipe that saved [the country] from what would have been an unprecedented political, social and economic crisis” and created “the most successful stabilization case in world history.” Since assuming office in December 2023, Milei has radically reduced monthly inflation from 11.9 percent that November to 2.1 percent last month. He has likewise succeeded in lowering poverty from 41.7 percent at the end of his Peronist predecessor Alberto Fernández’s presidency to 32 percent through the first half of this year, although the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina’s Observatory on Social Debt has suggested this decline may be “overrepresented.” Nevertheless, there are multiple reasons to believe the Argentine economy had been sinking, if not teetering on collapse, before the U.S. Treasury sprang into action. Efforts to integrate the nation’s sprawling villas (slums) into their respective cities have stalled out, while families are struggling to stay afloat amid debilitating cuts to soup kitchens, energy and transportation subsidies, and much more. Milei has also taken out a $20 billion loan from the IMF to help shore up his country’s depleted reserves, and in September, Argentina’s country risk, which measures its likelihood of debt default, briefly soared above 1,200 points. “Milei was facing the end of his government,” said Diego Guelar, the Argentine ambassador to the United States from 1997 to 1999 and 2002 to 2014. “Confidence in him had cratered, and the country was facing its first default since 2001. I’ve been Argentina’s ambassador in Washington twice, and I’ve never seen a bailout quite like this. The administration may have averted a crisis for now, but finding a long-term solution will depend on all of us.” On September 24, in a post on the social media platform X, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that U.S. government was prepared to “do what is needed to support Argentina and the Argentine people,” citing the country’s “geopolitical strategic importance.” In recent weeks, the terms of Trump administration’s relief package have slowly come into focus. They include a “significant” standby credit line via America’s Emergency Stabilization Fund, a $20 billion currency swap, and the purchase of Argentina’s dollar bonds. (The Treasury has already bought up Argentine pesos on the foreign exchange market.) Bessent has likewise indicated that his department is working with private-sector investment funds to create a separate $20 billion facility that would invest in the country’s sovereign debt. “Despite the tens of billions that Washington arranged in April from the IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank, Argentina’s economy has remained vulnerable to currency crises,” explained Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy. “The country’s sovereign bonds are rated in junk territory, which means bondholders are making a speculative investment and can sell off at the first sign of news they perceive to be bad.” Days after Bessent’s initial post on X, stories in both countries began circulating that the billionaire founder of Discovery Capital Management, Robert Citrone, was heavily invested in Argentina, and that he had long-standing ties to Bessent dating back to their time together at Soros Fund Management. Then, on October 9, The New York Times reported that investment firms including Blackrock, Fidelity, and Pimco all stood to profit handsomely from the Trump administration’s rescue plan. Bessent has separately told Fox News’s Laura Ingraham that Argentina is “rich in rare earths and uranium,” and that he expects they’ll be “committed to U.S. private companies coming in and being good partners with them.” “What people need to understand is that this not a bailout,” said Juan Grabois, a prominent social activist and Peronist candidate for president during the 2023 election cycle. “I read the Democrats’ original letter to Trump, and it sickened me that somebody like Bernie Sanders, who I know and respect, would call it that. This is an attempt to rescue a failing, far-right government. In Milei, Trump has found a court jester who he can use as his South American spokesman. And when that spokesman ceases to be of value, he’ll throw him away like he would a used condom.” A summit at the White House this week between representatives of the two countries would seem to bear out Grabois’s suspicions. During the lunch event on Tuesday, Trump revealed that although the United States is prepared to move forward with a bailout, it would “not be generous with Argentina” if Milei were to lose. (In typical Trump fashion, it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the upcoming midterms or Argentina’s 2027 election, when the the president he endorsed personally could be a lame duck.) “If he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.” Bessent was more to the point. “We’re confident that the president’s party will, and the coalition will, do well in the [midterm] election,” he said. “Going back to failed Peronist policies would cause a U.S. rethink.” The treasury secretary has since clarified that the United States will support the Argentine government regardless of how it performs later this month so long as it continues to pursue “good policies.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he described his department’s approach as that of “an economic Monroe Doctrine.” Last week, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, introduced a bill formally blocking the package. Republicans, meanwhile, have gone largely silent since Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa protested Trump’s willingness to enable a competing soybean exporter. Florida Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an outspoken member of the America First movement who has bucked the president on issues ranging from Israel to health care and tariffs, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Milei reappeared onstage sometime after 10 p.m. with an Argentine flag draped over a fresh suit and tie. After growling his way through the national anthem, he finally got down to the business of the evening: a discussion with Buenos Aires Aires city legislator and presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni about the themes of his latest book and the future of the country more broadly. By then, the crowd had noticeably thinned and the mood had grown subdued. Over the next half hour, Milei delivered a discourse that has become familiar to Argentine and American audiences alike. He railed against the evils of cancel culture and “wokeismo,” denouncing what he called the left’s penchant for political violence. He extolled the “colossus of the world” Donald Trump to a smattering of applause. He implored his voters to not let up in the next election, that “freedom must advance, or Argentina will go backward.” And through it all, the flag sat bunched in his lap like a child’s blanket. As the audience filed out past a Maybelline New York lipstick station and a Smirnoff-sponsored selfie booth, Milei concluded his event as only he could—with a promise to “make Argentina great again.”

Title: Mamdani has backers on Wall Street. It's their bosses who are boosting Cuomo for NYC's next mayor.

New York's Wall Street elites are signing massive checks to support Andrew Cuomo's mayoral race, while some of the rank-and-file are donating to Zohran Mamdani in hopes that someday their much smaller paychecks can land them an apartment without roommates. Business Insider's analysis of donation data and conversations with donors on Wall Street shed light on this divide ahead of Thursday night's first general election debate. Almost 80% of higher-earning, front-office workers, like investment bankers or hedge fund managers, donated to Cuomo and affiliated groups. The Mamdani camp won out among nearly every other job function, receiving direct donations from almost 90% of back-office donors like those in operations, human resources, tech, and research. Take Jane Street, a highly secretive trading group. Sixteen of its employees donated to both candidates for a total just over $10,000. Only one — a trader — boosted Cuomo, writing a $5,000 check. The other fifteen, mostly software engineers, gave an average of just over $350 each to Mamdani. When America thinks of Wall Street, it pictures investment bankers decked out in collared shirts and Patagonia vests. Many workers in the financial industry aren't cutting big deals — they're making under $200K. They donated $25 here and $110 there because they appreciate Mamdani's focus on cost of living. Even for those making six figures in finance, rents are high. Wall Streeters showed up for Mamdani in slightly greater numbers, but with smaller checks. Across more than 400 financial companies, 397 workers donated directly to Cuomo's campaign versus 401 to Mamdani's. Cuomo's donors had deeper pockets, giving 88% of the total dollars donated, with an average donation per employee of $1,006, compared to Mamdani's $131. When factoring in PAC spending, the pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani dollar disparity is even larger: 95% of the more than $9 million the industry donated went to support Cuomo, who has his own affordability plan but has also stressed crime and subway safety during his campaign. Mamdani got less than 5% the donations that came from managers and investment professionals, compared to two thirds of donations given by all other roles. Tech workers in finance were particularly supportive of Mamdani compared to other departments, giving him 88% of their donations. The wealth gap between front and back office is relative. A hypothetical administrative assistant earning roughly $83,000 a year may be debating whether he can afford a big enough home for two kids, but he's not struggling to feed his family. But compared to an early-career investment banker earning nearly $300,000 and on a trajectory toward $1.25 million when they become a managing director, there is a large financial gulf. The assistant's salary would go far in other cities, but in New York, back-office support workers told Business Insider tha their relative positions mean they relate more to Mamdani's middle-class base than to their bosses. They told us that's not about political parties — he is the Democratic nominee, and Cuomo, a Democrat, is running as an independent — it's all about cost of living. "The emphasis on affordability was especially appealing to me," said one donor, a lifelong New Yorker who once worked in a non-investment role on Wall Street and canvassed for Mamdani. "Even as someone working in finance, rent is crazy," said this donor, adding that she's seen coworkers and neighbors increasingly priced out and pushed to the suburbs. Mamdani has run on promises to freeze prices of rent-stabilized apartments, make city buses free, and provide free childcare for all New Yorkers. He proposes paying for this by increasing taxes on residents who make more than $1 million a year and raising the corporate tax rate statewide by 4.25% — which would require state approval. Wall Street bosses have warned that electing him would drive companies to leave the world's financial capital. Have a tip? Contact these reporters via Signal at alexnicoll.01 and julianakaplan.33.

"I'm supporting Zohran because I want a mayor who prioritizes the needs of the working and middle class," a creative worker at a Wall Street firm said. "Those have always been my priorities as well. Working on Wall Street doesn't change that at all." We looked at firms that invest, manage, or transfer financial assets and those that create the infrastructure needed to make this possible. This includes hedge funds, like Citadel, whose CEO Ken Griffin wrote a $50,000 check to an anti-Mamdani PAC, or Third Point, whose CEO Dan Loeb donated more than $350,000 to Cuomo and related PACs. Loeb tweeted after Mamdani's primary win that it's "officially hot commie summer." Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman on Wednesday gave $1 million to an anti-Mamdani PAC, following $500,000 in donations earlier this year to pro-Cuomo PACs. Ackman wrote on X in September that Mamdani has "no experience, none, in managing a business, let alone the most consequential and largest city in our country." Cuomo, "is an experienced leader that cares deeply about our city who has the relevant experience and skills necessary to lead and greatly improve NYC," he added. We also looked at investment banks, including JPMorgan Chase, whose chief Jamie Dimon said that Mamdani was a "Marxist" at an event earlier this summer, before saying on Tuesday he would help Mamdani if he were elected, and payments firms like the large credit card companies. It also includes real estate investors, like Stephen Ross, chairman of Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, who gave $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC. Real estate brokers and services firms were excluded from the analysis. Looking at firms' donations themselves rather than their employees, 23 financial companies contributed more than $2 million to pro-Cuomo and anti-Mamdani PACs, and none to Mamdani. Paul Ryan, a 60-year-old retired investment banker and hedge fund executive who made waves as part of a small but vocal cohort of bankers who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, described the divide in colorful terms. "Older guys that have houses in Greenwich are still going to want to keep their houses in Greenwich, so they're not willing to go put their balls on the line. But younger people do; they have 40 more years of living, and are you going to live it in a Trump-dominated world?" There were some outliers among Wall Street's high rollers. For example, two wealth advisors at Merrill Lynch, the private wealth arm of Bank of America, donated a total of $7,000 to pro-Mamdani PACs, and two of the three brothers who founded budgeting app Rocket Money gave a total of $189,000 to a pro-Mamdani PAC. The donors we spoke to said they don't talk politics at work very much and are left to pick up on hints of their coworkers' affiliations. Those who support Mamdani said they assume they're in the minority. They're far from alone in the city, though: A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from October 3 to 7 of 1,015 likely New York City voters found that Mamdani held a 46-33% lead over Cuomo. "I think it's always been kind of a fiction that where someone works is a key factor in how they vote, or what party they support, or what political candidates they support," Morris Pearl, a former managing director of BlackRock and the chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group of wealthy individuals who advocate for changes to the US tax system, said. Pearl sees folks falling into two categories: Those who may not want to pay more in taxes, and those who are "more aware that living in a city filled with people who can't afford their basic needs is not going to be good for even the rich people either." Beyond politics, Anna Tavis, clinical professor and chair of the Human Capital Management Department at NYU's School of Professional Studies, said that Mamdani represents a different expectation of leadership, "regardless of what his views are, but kind of more appealing as a person, very media savvy, connecting with the people." She added that many younger workers want their leaders to be more transparent and address the issues they care about, rather than protect the status quo. "Both sides, interestingly, I think want to get to the right place," Tavis said. "They want to be successful, they want their companies to succeed, et cetera, et cetera, but they believe in the different ways of accomplishing that."

Title: Caroline Irwin: ‘living with psoriasis day-to-day was terrible’

LOYALTY CODE: The paper code cannot be redeemed when browsing in private/incognito mode. Please go to a normal browser window and enter the code there Caroline Irwin was nine years old when she first experienced psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects at least 73,000 people in Ireland. Psoriasis causes the immune system to become overactive, and there is an increase in the rate at which skin cells are produced and shed from the skin. This leads to a build-up of thick, red, scaly patches that can be dry and itchy. Psoriasis first appeared on Caroline’s scalp as a crusty scale that was itchy and thick. “My mum took me to our local GP at the time, and it was in the days before any internet. He took down a huge encyclopedia and showed me horrendous pictures of psoriasis,” she says. “Within three weeks, mine spread down into my forehead and all over my body.” For five decades, Caroline, who lives in Ballyfoyle, Co Kilkenny, did not know what life was like without psoriasis. “I’ve never not had it,” she explains. “Mine never went away. And then in those days, there was no information about treatments. It was steroid creams, and that was it. “I was just covered in it for all those years. I just ignored it. We were told it was a skin condition and not contagious, and off you go.” Decades on, there is much more information publicly available about psoriasis, including what causes it and how to manage it. Professor Caitriona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic explains that the condition affects people of all ages. “It develops due to a combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. If you have a family history of psoriasis, you may be more likely to develop it. “Certain triggers such as stress, infections, alcohol, smoking, some medications, and seasonal changes can activate the immune system and bring on flare-ups,” says Professor Ryan. Professor Caitriona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. Living with psoriasis Living with psoriasis day-to-day “was terrible”, according to Caroline. “You’d never try on clothes in a shop, because you’d be leaving flakes all over the place. It was horrible. And then when you scratch it, the skin just shed all over the place and it bled a lot. If you stayed in a hotel room, it was a nightmare, because you’d leave blood on the sheets like somebody had been shot.” Caroline was hospitalised on three different occasions for psoriasis: once in Cork when she was 18 years old and twice in Holland, where she lived for seven years. “That’s when it hit me,” says Caroline. “They used to let me go in and out as a day patient but then one day, they took my temperature and said: you can’t go home, you’re seriously ill.” Caroline had developed erythrodermic psoriasis, which is very dangerous. It is where the red flakes spread across the entire skin surface; and with so much skin flaking off, it can lead to lower body temperature, infections and even heart failure. “I could have gone into kidney or liver failure. I never had a clue of how serious was. You’re losing all your body heat. I was sitting there shivering and it was roasting,” Caroline recalls. When she moved back to Ireland from the Netherlands in the 1990s, Caroline set up the Psoriasis Association – now part of the Irish Skin Foundation – to increase awareness of psoriasis and support those living with the condition. “I just came back here to Kilkenny with a tube of cream and I thought, I can’t be doing this,” she says. “We started off with about six people in a hotel, but it grew over the years – we now have nearly 1,000 people.” Caroline also registered with a dermatologist in Waterford who helped her to try the new range of treatments that had become available. Now Caroline uses biologic treatments, a medication that targets the part of the immune system that is overactive because of psoriasis, and is administered by injection. “The treatment stops the psoriasis in its tracks. I was worried about trying these because they were new, but I had no choice. “I inject myself twice a week and I am completely clear,” says Caroline. “It happened around my 60th birthday. I got my ears pierced for my 60th birthday. I bought swimming togs, I bought dresses, shorts. I can’t believe the change in my life. I’m now 65 and I wake up every morning and I still look at my arms. I can’t believe this is my body I’m looking at.” Caroline Irwin at Butler Garden in Kilkenny. \ Odhran Ducie Managing your psoriasis Professor Ryan is keen to reassure that psoriasis can be effectively managed with the right treatment and lifestyle strategies. “Options range from topical creams and ointments for milder cases, to light therapy with controlled doses of ultraviolet light, and systemic medications or biologic injections for more severe cases. A healthy lifestyle can also help reduce flare-ups. “Maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking and excess alcohol, and practising stress management techniques all support skin health. Working closely with a dermatologist allows treatment to be tailored to each individual so that psoriasis can be kept well controlled and quality of life can be restored.” Caroline’s skin may be much better now but she has developed psoriatic arthritis and Type 2 diabetes, which are common comorbidities [coexisting health conditions]. “Beyond the skin, psoriasis is now recognised as a systemic condition, meaning it is linked with inflammation throughout the body and can sometimes be associated with arthritis, as well as other health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes,” explains Professor Ryan. In her work as psoriasis advocate serving on the board of Skin Foundation Ireland, Caroline is raising awareness about the condition and potential complications. “I’m trying to get it out there that people could develop Type 2 diabetes and arthritis with it.” With autumn now here, many people may notice their psoriasis flaring up due to less ultraviolet (UV) exposure. “Many people with psoriasis notice their skin is better in the summer and worse in the autumn and winter months,” explains Professor Ryan.“This is partly because natural sunlight contains ultraviolet light, which helps to reduce inflammation in the skin. In summer, people are often more relaxed, outdoors more frequently, and may experience lower stress levels, all of which can improve psoriasis. “As the days shorten and temperatures drop, reduced UV exposure, cold dry air, central heating, and seasonal infections such as colds or sore throats can all trigger flare-ups. “It is so important to prepare as we move into the colder months. Keeping skin well moisturised, managing stress, and staying consistent with treatment can all help keep psoriasis in check.” In Short The Irish Skin Foundation provides free, specialist guidance for people struggling to manage skin conditions such as psoriasis via their ‘Ask-a-Nurse’ helpline.

Caroline Irwin was nine years old when she first experienced psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects at least 73,000 people in Ireland. Psoriasis causes the immune system to become overactive, and there is an increase in the rate at which skin cells are produced and shed from the skin. This leads to a build-up of thick, red, scaly patches that can be dry and itchy. Psoriasis first appeared on Caroline’s scalp as a crusty scale that was itchy and thick. “My mum took me to our local GP at the time, and it was in the days before any internet. He took down a huge encyclopedia and showed me horrendous pictures of psoriasis,” she says. “Within three weeks, mine spread down into my forehead and all over my body.” For five decades, Caroline, who lives in Ballyfoyle, Co Kilkenny, did not know what life was like without psoriasis. “I’ve never not had it,” she explains. “Mine never went away. And then in those days, there was no information about treatments. It was steroid creams, and that was it. “I was just covered in it for all those years. I just ignored it. We were told it was a skin condition and not contagious, and off you go.” Decades on, there is much more information publicly available about psoriasis, including what causes it and how to manage it. Professor Caitriona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic explains that the condition affects people of all ages. “It develops due to a combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. If you have a family history of psoriasis, you may be more likely to develop it. “Certain triggers such as stress, infections, alcohol, smoking, some medications, and seasonal changes can activate the immune system and bring on flare-ups,” says Professor Ryan.

Title: Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber says she would consider adding an AI agent to her board of directors

Lee Clifford is an Executive Editor at Fortune. Primarily she works with the Enterprise reporting team, which covers Tech, Leadership, and Finance as well as daily news and analysis from Fortune’s most experienced writers. Good morning. Would you add an AI to your company’s board? Yes, the idea sounds crazy. Then again, what would you think about a board member with perfect recall, exemplary computation skills, and the ability to dig into data and ask hard questions? Starts to sound not so crazy after all. And at least one CEO who spoke at the Fortune Most Powerful Women summit, which wrapped up in D.C. yesterday, says she’s open to it. Hanneke Faber, CEO of global tech manufacturing company Logitech, says she’d entertain the idea of an AI joining her board, as my colleague Sydney Lake reported. “We already use [AI agents] in almost every meeting,” Faber told the audience. She said that while AI agents (in her case Microsoft Copilot as well as internal bots), are currently summarizing and notetaking and idea generating, things are progressing fast. “As they evolve—and some of the best agents or assistants that we’ve built actually do things themselves—that comes with a whole bunch of governance things,” Faber said. “You have to keep in mind and make sure you really want that bot to take action. But if you don’t have an AI agent in every meeting, you’re missing out on some of the productivity.” Reshema Kemps-Polanco, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at global pharmaceutical company Novartis, also said she’s been training an AI bot to help run a “very rigorous commercial launch.” The bot is being trained to assess the team’s launch plan, and is getting “smarter and smarter” about asking strategic questions, she said. “It’s trained to look for gaps in the plan,” said Kemps-Polanco during a session titled “Dissecting the Global Economy,” which was presented by Novartis. Of course, the idea of having an AI board member opens up a host of thorny ethical issues. What would happen if the AI recommended a strategy that goes south? Or relies on biased data to make a decision? However, given that the average director of an S&P 500 company made $336,352 in total compensation last year according to Spencer Stuart, adding a bot to a board may be a better deal than you think.—Lee CliffordContact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump’s crypto empire has earned him $1 billion-plus so far The president has earned $550 million from the WLFI token and $362 million from the $TRUMP coin, among other crypto ventures, according to the FT. His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which has a bitcoin-treasury, is now worth $1.9 billion. “Of course there’s a bubble,” says AI VC, “bubbles are good.” VC funds have ploughed $161 billion this year into a handful of AI startups whose collective valuation is now around $1 trillion. Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst, told the FT, “Bubbles are good. Bubbles align capital and talent in a new trend, and that creates some carnage but it also creates enduring, new businesses that change the world.” 10,000 federal workers will be fired in shutdown The number is more than twice as big as previously disclosed. About 300,000 federal jobs have been lost through attrition this year, the White House said. Morgan Stanley’s earnings blowout Morgan Stanley smashed Wall Street expectations during its earnings call on Wednesday, posting $18.2 billion in net revenue for the quarter. That’s an 18% year-over-year increase, thanks in part to increased dealmaking and trade activity. BlackRock-led group to acquire data infrastructure company for $40 billion The AI Infrastructure Partnership, a group of investors led by BlackRock, agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the companies announced on Wednesday. The deal comes just a day after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink dispelled concerns about an AI bubble on CNBC Squawk Box. Must-read profile on secretive First Brands CEO The FT unpicks how a virtually unknown business leader with a string of failed businesses behind him was able to borrow $12 billion from Wall Street. Separately, the WSJ explores whether Jefferies should have known that the company was unsound when it was helping the company refinance its loans. Elsewhere: Trump says he has persuaded India to stop buying Russian oil … National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the government would bail out farmers whose businesses have been ruined by the trade war after the shutdown ends … The president approved of covert CIA operations inside Venezuela but few other details are available.

Title: K.M. and the regulation about the Unknown Soldier, PASOK aiming for bronze (after Tsipras), the nerves of the MPs, Grimaldi and Syvota, the German and Wahba

Time Published: 2025-10-16T06:37:36Z
Full Content:
Hello, I’ll start today with the case of the “Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,” with some observations and a bit of reporting. First of all, let’s clarify that according to my source from the Ministry of Defense, Dendias was aware of Mitsotakis’ decision—to assign the guarding of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to the Ministry of Defense—since last Thursday, when the Prime Minister himself called him. Mitsotakis’ post, I remind you, came three days later, on Sunday morning, on his Facebook page. I asked insistently whether Dendias expressed any objections to this, and my source answered negatively—and, frankly, no one would expect Dendias, with his profile as a serious and reasonable right-wing politician, to react otherwise. I’m told that the amendment stipulating that anyone desecrating the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier will face arrest and up to two years in prison will most likely be submitted on Monday by Mitsotakis himself, who will also elaborate on the issue. Spokesman Marinakis clarified yesterday that they’re not going to erase the names of the dead from the monument, but that “the tent is over.” And I think that’s the right handling—to avoid giving the usual suspects an excuse to stir up tension. Now let’s turn to PASOK’s reaction yesterday. I systematically avoid commenting on Ms. Karystianou for obvious reasons. But PASOK’s announcement highlighted the party’s major identity crisis. In simple terms, leader Nikos has lost his bearings—even on an issue as relatively straightforward as this one for a rational, centrist party like PASOK has been since 1985. You can’t be both for the policeman and against him, as the old saying goes, because in the end you look ridiculous. And of course, no centrist voter is “for the tent.” With all this going on, PASOK is heading for third place. As we wrote recently, Tsipras’ people claim that polls show them trending toward second place, ahead of PASOK. A reliable source of mine confirmed that Tsipras is now polling at a solid 8% (“yes, I’ll vote for him”), with another 4–5% in focus groups saying they’re “very close to voting for him.” So, he’s taking about two-thirds of SYRIZA, all of New Left, and nibbling votes across the left spectrum—plus about one point from Nikos. That adds up to around 12.5% for Tσίπρας, while PASOK sits at 12% in the same survey. We’ll see in the coming months whether this holds up—but if PASOK keeps “pretending to be Zoi (Konstantopoulou), just more polished,” as some say, they’re definitely heading for bronze. Today’s parliamentary session will focus heavily on national issues, as part of the pre-agenda debate. I understand that Mitsotakis, who’s generally irritated by the domestic criticism his government faces and by the breakdown of institutional unity, has decided to strike a sharp tone in both his speech and his closing remarks. Yesterday’s meeting between Minister Tsiaras and ND MPs at party headquarters was a known “minefield,” and the discussion was far from easy. Still, it could have been worse if not for two small pressure-release valves: first, payments that went through yesterday along with some relief measures for affected producers; second, Tsiaras’ honesty—he described the tough situation and read letters the ministry received from the European Commission. Despite good intentions, ND MPs are furious—both over the handling of the livestock epidemic and the mess with farm subsidies. Some doubt whether OPEKEPE should move under the tax authority (AADE), arguing that the agency also certifies, not just pays out funds. Others say precious time was lost and the issue underestimated, though they’ve now been promised that advance payments for the basic subsidy will be completed by the end of November. Everyone, however, recognizes that in a social group that once gave ND nearly 50%, the mood has turned sour. Of course, they all knew what was going on—but now that things have tightened, they’re speaking up, worried about reelection. On Friday, Mitsotakis plans a visit to Peristeri. He’s expected to inaugurate the city’s new courthouse with ministers Floridis and Bougas, alongside a blessing ceremony by local Bishop Grigorios. The area is his old constituency, so it’s familiar territory. In general, he’ll be resuming his public rounds. And while we’re on the Prime Minister’s schedule: the Onassis Foundation has completed the new National Transplant Center and the renovation of the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center. On Tuesday, October 21, Mitsotakis will inaugurate this major donation. The new National Transplant Center is state-of-the-art—built at a cost of €100 million, with cutting-edge medical technology worth over €30 million. The 7,000-sq-meter, four-story facility has 47 new beds (33 for children) and 12 pediatric ICU beds (5 for infants). Samaras made his first public appearance in a while yesterday, at Karamanlis’ speech in the Old Parliament building. A week earlier, he’d avoided a face-to-face meeting with Mitsotakis—who, though invited, carefully stayed away. Instead, Hatzidakis had to drink the “bitter cup,” finding himself suddenly seated next to Samaras (though that chair had been empty at first). I’m told Samaras now plans to appear regularly at public events—from now on, expect to see more of him, with all that implies. Yesterday at the Hotel Grande Bretagne took place the second Olympia Dialogues event. After banker Josef Ackermann headlined the first one, this time Panos Germanos and Andreas Athanasopoulos hosted Dr. Sadek Wahba, founder of the private equity firm I Squared Capital. Based in Miami, with about $60 billion under management, I Squared Capital invests broadly in infrastructure — from water, ports, and logistics to data centers, batteries, and transport. Wahba, who already has connections in Greece and sees the country as a major investment opportunity, even owns companies operating London’s red double-decker buses. Among the high-profile Greek business figures attending were D. Papalexopoulos, Eutychis Vassilakis, Nikos Karamouzis, G. Linatsas (AXIA), Stelios Frangos (Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund investment fund), Aris Karytinos (Prodea), K. Kazas (Grant Thornton), Rania Aikaterinari (SEV), Giannis Emiris (Alpha Bank), H. Lampropoulos (Hellenic Development Bank of Investments), N. Vettas (IOBE), G. Michos, and others. There is deep concern in the insurance sector about the future and the impending transformations in the market. The aggressive entry of banks into the insurance business has alarmed insurers who are being left out, fearing that this will exert heavy pressure on the industry, create new, unpredictable dynamics, and limit access to premium-generation “channels.” Their worries are far from unfounded. The famous Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab—at 750 15th Street NW in Washington, D.C., right across from the White House—is one of America’s best-known restaurants. With several private rooms, it’s a discreet meeting spot for politicians, business leaders, and analysts. During the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, Joe’s Steakhouse becomes the traditional meeting place for the Greek delegation, where it holds key talks away from prying eyes. Michalis Masourakis has already handled the necessary reservations, and Greece is, in fact, a popular discussion topic this year. Between plates of Florida stone crab claws, prime steaks, and the famous lemon pie, major deals are often sealed. Just days ago, Argentine President Javier Milei celebrated there after securing a $20 billion aid deal for Argentina, even inviting the Chinese to buy soy from Argentina instead of the U.S. The Greek team arrived Tuesday afternoon and began meetings all day Wednesday, starting with JP Morgan and Oliver Wyman. Guido Emanuele Grimaldi, chairman of the Igoumenitsa Port Authority, appears to have big plans for the wider region, aiming to attract more Italian tourists to Greece. Speaking informally during the Shortsea Shipping Owners Association Conference in Athens (“Walking into a New Era”), he revealed that he’s focusing especially on Syvota and Plataria, areas in a strategic location—close to Paxos and just 48 miles from Italy. “Syvota is a beautiful area, but not well-known in Italy,” he admitted. “Only the region of Apulia really knows it—elsewhere, Italians discover it mainly through sailing.” Since the area is just a few hours away by sea, Grimaldi believes Western Greece is highly appealing for Italian travelers. This initiative is part of a broader tourism development plan to boost visitor numbers and strengthen the local economy of Igoumenitsa. The long-anticipated discussion at the 2nd Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee began on Tuesday in London, focusing on the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which aims to establish new decarbonization measures for global shipping. The framework is expected to be put to a vote today, Thursday, October 16, 2025 — unless postponed to tomorrow. This is perhaps the only instance where the United States and Russia stand publicly side by side, joined by Saudi Arabia, all strongly opposing the adoption of these new environmental rules. Many countries initially kept their positions secret, while Saudi Arabia, on the very first day, even requested that the working group not begin — a request that was denied. Participants have been redrafting several parts of the text, which, according to one source “present on the ground,” were almost nonsensical in their original form. The lobbying has been intense: one country’s delegate initially announced they would support the measures, only to reverse course a few hours later after strong backlash from domestic shipowners. The electoral General Assembly of the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) took place on Monday, October 6, 2025, marking a new chapter for Cypriot shipping. Polys V. HadjiIoannou was elected as president, and the new board includes several prominent Greek shipowners: Thanasis Martinos, Ioannis Coustas, Haris Vafias, Ioanna Procopiou, and George Tsavliris. The OPAP stock showed a stabilizing trend in yesterday’s trading session. It remained mostly positive throughout the day, dipping slightly during the auctions to close at €18.60. The stock has now entered a new phase, characterized by high trading volumes — €26.8 million on Monday, €77 million on Tuesday, and €22.6 million yesterday — on par with the activity seen in the major banks. Brokers noted that OPAP will attract portfolios seeking both growth and dividend yield, as management has pledged a minimum payout of €1 per share. The possibility of future acquisitions remains on the table, as emphasized during the company’s analyst call. In the coming months, OPAP and its parent company Allwyn will be in the spotlight as analysts and institutional investors are briefed on the ambitious merger that aims to create a €16 billion integrated gaming and lottery giant, headquartered in Athens, with a strong presence in both Europe and the U.S.. Such scale, especially for a company based in Greece, is truly unprecedented. Greek retail investors continue to pour about €100 million weekly into mutual funds, which now total €28.3 billion in assets. Company earnings have been solid but unspectacular, while a wave of major deals shows that listed firms are preparing for the next era of capital markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve, meeting on October 27–28, is expected to cut interest rates by another 0.25%, citing weak labor market data rather than inflation. Meanwhile, Christine Lagarde, mindful of Paris and Berlin, is also hinting at a possible Eurozone rate cut. In this mixed environment — neither bearish nor euphoric — the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) followed its recent pattern: starting strong in the morning, then losing momentum around midday when U.S. funds usually enter the market, only to rely on domestic support later. Yesterday, minor boosts came from Coca-Cola HBC (+1.13% at €39.22) and Eurobank (+0.39% at €3.63), but the market eventually slipped, closing at 2,045.81 points, down 0.54%, near the day’s low. Total trading value reached €252.83 million, including €14.48 million in 19 block trades. Aegean Airlines, with €2 million in turnover, gained 3.01%, closing at €13.70. Tomorrow night, Standard & Poor’s will release its new rating for Greece’s sovereign credit. In smaller-cap stocks, trading remains highly speculative, often moving on just a few tens of thousands of euros — making any trend fragile and easily reversible. At the end of 2020, a startup was founded in Greece with the goal of changing the way people lease cars — offering flexibility, good prices, and “complete services.” FlexCar, founded by Konstantinos Davaris and Giorgos Desyllas (co-founders and CEO–CFO respectively), has shown impressive growth in recent years. However, in recent days, FlexCar customers have been receiving messages and letters announcing dramatic rent increases of up to +30%. “For us, it’s not just the vehicle,” the letter reads. “It’s everything that comes with it: full maintenance, technical inspection, 24/7 roadside assistance, full insurance coverage, a replacement vehicle, and the option to change or buy out the car.” “The increases in maintenance costs, spare parts, and insurance have significantly affected the car market.” As a result, FlexCar announces that: “…from your upcoming lease period, the new monthly rent for your vehicle” will increase by +30%. For example, a Toyota Yaris goes from €366.81 to €460, and a VW Polo from €271.40 to €320. For now, there’s no information on whether other companies will follow suit. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, gave an interview to CNBC yesterday, revealing the next big bet of the world’s largest asset manager — which oversees $10 trillion in portfolios: “Forget paper — everything will become tokens.” According to Fink, every asset — real estate, stocks, bonds, even works of art — will be turned into digital tokens operating on a blockchain. “We are only at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to stocks and bonds. There are $4.1 trillion globally in digital wallets. If we could tokenize an ETF, we could bring crypto investors into long-term retirement products. This is the next wave of opportunity for BlackRock.” Instead of holding a piece of paper proving stock ownership, an investor will hold a token. Instead of buying an entire apartment, they’ll buy 0.5% of a property as a token. The $4.1 trillion in digital wallets globally represents funds invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies — mostly speculative, not long-term investments like pension funds or ETFs. BlackRock aims to bridge that gap. If an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) were tokenized, crypto investors could buy it directly from their digital wallets — no banks, intermediaries, or traditional accounts required. BlackRock has already secured approval for a Bitcoin ETF in 2024, attracting billions in just a few months. Tokenizing financial markets promises 24/7 trading, unlike traditional exchanges that close overnight. It also offers instant settlement (instead of 2–3 days) and greater accessibility (you can invest with just €10). Of course, uncertainties and big questions remain: Who regulates these tokens? How is transaction reliability ensured? What happens if you lose your wallet password? Fink said we’re at the beginning of this revolution. If he’s right, the financial system in 10 years will be unrecognizable. If not, it’ll be just another trend that flared up and burned out. The Financial Times revealed yesterday that four tech giants — BlackRock, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Elon Musk’s xAI — have formed a consortium to acquire one of the world’s largest data center operators for $40 billion. Nvidia controls 90% of the AI chip market and wants to ensure its clients have access to infrastructure. Microsoft is investing billions in AI but depends on third parties for servers. Musk needs data centers to expand Grok without relying on competitors. Data centers — the “brains” of artificial intelligence — are now considered the most valuable real estate in technology. The four companies would control the chain from the chip (Nvidia), to the cloud (Microsoft), to the AI model (xAI), and the software itself. For now, the war for dominance in AI is being fought with steel, concrete, and massive amounts of energy. Explore related questions

Title: BlackRock CEO thinks tokenization of all assets is just ‘beginning’ – Details

How far could tokenizing real-world assets really go? Fink called tokenization a game-changing innovation that lets investors, including crypto holders, access long-term products like ETFs on blockchain platforms. BlackRock currently manages BUIDL, a tokenized money market fund with $2.8 billion AUM. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck an optimistic tone in a recent interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. He highlighted the firm’s strong third-quarter results, while also touching upon its expanding footprint across key financial verticals. Fink noted that the company’s growth has been broad-based, driven by robust performances in cash management, AI-powered equity strategies, and blockchain initiatives. Looking ahead, he spotlighted the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, equities, and bonds, as the “next wave of opportunity.” He also positioned this initiative as a central pillar of BlackRock’s long-term innovation strategy. Fink said, “You know, I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities.” During the interview, Fink also outlined how tokenization could fundamentally transform the investment landscape. He explained that blockchain-based tokenization would bridge traditional finance with digital infrastructure. This approach would allow investors, even those using digital wallets or crypto holdings, to seamlessly access conventional long-term financial products such as ETFs. As part of this vision, Fink revealed that BlackRock already operates a tokenized money market fund – BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity (BUIDL) Fund. It also manages one of the largest Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs in existence, with assets surpassing $100 billion. In short, once a crypto skeptic, Fink candidly admitted that he now “loves it,” signaling how institutional confidence in digital assets has evolved over the years. Fink also cited decades of market resilience, from the dot-com crash to the pandemic. In doing so, he emphasized that staying invested through volatility allows compounding to work in investors’ favor. The discussion arose on the back of BlackRock’s rapid growth across markets. Its Spot-based Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs remain the largest of their kind in the U.S, with $93 billion and $17 billion in AUM, respectively. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), launched in partnership with tokenization firm Securitize, now manages $2.8 billion across Ethereum, Solana [SOL], and Avalanche [AVAX]. This makes it the largest tokenized money market fund to date. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $111,828, following modest gains of 0.3% in 24 hours. As it stands, BlackRock plans to expand its tokenized products, potentially including its flagship crypto and traditional ETFs. In facr, according to a Bloomberg report, BlackRock is exploring plans to bring stocks and other real-world assets on-chain, allowing them to trade as digital tokens. In short, all these moves could position the firm at the forefront of Wall Street’s tokenization revolution.

Title: Paddy McCarthy is match-sharp and ready if called upon for Ireland debut against Japan
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/10/16/paddy-mccarthy-is-match-sharp-and-ready-if-called-upon-for-ireland-debut-against-japan/

Paddy McCarthy will be hoping it’s second time lucky after being named in Andy Farrell’s Ireland squad for the four November Tests. The 22-year-old prop was one of 11 uncapped players who travelled to take on Georgia and Portugal during the summer but while nine made their debuts, McCarthy and Ulster scrumhalf Nathan Doak missed out. That fate is unlikely to befall him again, with a crack at Japan at the Aviva Stadium on November 8th a likely occasion for his first cap. Paddy is the youngest of three McCarthy boys alongside Leinster, Ireland and Lions secondrow Joe and the eldest, Andrew, a former Leinster culture captain and a member of the Seapoint Dragons mixed ability team. Paddy started in Old Belvedere minis before attending Blackrock College where he won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup under the captaincy of hooker Gus McCarthy, who has gone on to represent Leinster and Ireland. Centre Hugh Cooney, also from that Blackrock schools side, has featured for Leinster while Ruben Moloney, Liam Molony and Oliver Coffey are in the Leinster academy. Tom Brigg is in Ulster’s academy, while Conor O’Shaughnessy and Mikey Yarr are in Connacht’s. McCarthy’s talent, athleticism, speed, power, capacity to break or beat tackles and facility to play both sides of the frontrow made him a standout player in the Ireland Under-20’s Grand Slam-winning team in 2023. That team went to South Africa that summer and reached the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to France. He made his Leinster senior debut in October of that year, coming on as a replacement against Glasgow Warriors, and won a further three caps before Christmas. Injuries limited his involvement thereafter and he made just two further appearances, but he played for Ireland in an A international against England at Bristol and was then selected for the summer tour to Tbilisi and Lisbon. Having come on against the Stormers in the first game of the season, he made his first start for Leinster in his seventh cap for the province against the Bulls. McCarthy then retained his place in the run-on team for last weekend’s win over the Sharks at the Aviva Stadium. His latest performance was a tour de force that showcased all of those qualities listed above. There’s little doubt he benefits from being in an environment where he is subjected to rigorous daily challenges laid down by his fellow Leinster props in the Ireland squad – Andrew Porter, Jack Boyle, Tadhg Furlong and Thomas Clarkson. The call-up is a fitting reward for an outstanding prospect. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: US, China still committed to global debt efforts, IMF strategy chief says

The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and current G20 president South Africa issued a progress report after the meeting, calling for continued efforts to address elevated debt vulnerabilities, particularly in low-income countries. It said debt levels in low-income countries and emerging economies had generally stabilised but remained higher than during the pre-COVID-19 era, with a few being particularly vulnerable. Many also faced elevated debt-service challenges, crowding out spending on education, health and infrastructure. "Recent shifts in global policies and cuts in foreign aid add to the challenges," the report said, underscoring the need for domestic reforms by debtor countries to boost growth, with specific attention to rising domestic debt vulnerabilities. Participants agreed to keep working to improve debt restructuring processes, including looking for ways to accelerate the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, accelerating support to countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service challenges, and strengthening transparency. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu said the continued participation of the US and China in the roundtable, despite a fierce trade war dividing the world's two largest economies, showed their commitment to keep addressing the high debt levels hurting developing countries. The roundtable, which met during the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, had led to progress in shortening the timelines of official debt restructurings and reworking bonded debt, but there was more work to do on non-bonded debt, Pazarbasioglu told reporters before the meeting. "These discussions have been important to get everyone on the same page," she said. "The fact that tomorrow we will have the US Treasury Secretary (Scott Bessent) there, China will be there, and others will be there, is a sign that they are still committed to this discussion." The progress report showed that transparency was a shared concern, especially regarding non-bonded debt. "Non-bonded debt is the laggard at this point," Pazarbasioglu said, noting some countries had moved through a restructuring but still faced bank exposures or other loans that prevented credit ratings agencies from removing their default status and raising ratings. "This is a critical step to make sure that countries are able to access lower cost financing. So that's what we are really focusing on now," she said. A recent IMF paper detailed the challenges faced by such countries - including Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia and Suriname. The report cited broad support for earlier and more comprehensive publication by official creditor committees of the key terms of restructurings - including the net present value reduction - once an agreement was reached, though full consensus had not yet been reached. Participants also broadly supported extending to all G20 creditors the World Bank's "Debt Data Sharing Exercise," which ensures the data of debtors and creditors are reconciled. Many of them expressed strong interest in the World Bank's proposal for a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot program launched with Indonesia, it said. Negotiators continue to work on a declaration on debt issues that the Group of 20 major economies, which launched the Common Framework for debt restructurings during the COVID-19 pandemic, hopes to issue on Thursday, participants said. Global debt is at record levels, but many emerging markets have actually reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios, although they still face crushing debt service payments and have been crowded out of the capital market by advanced economies. Liquidity is a bigger concern now than solvency, Pazarbasioglu said. Debt experts say high borrowing costs on international capital markets have effectively shut out many riskier borrowers, pushing governments to opt for loans where terms and conditions are rarely published. Jose Vinals, former group chairman of Standard Chartered, one of the two private-sector creditors together with BlackRock that are part of the global sovereign debt roundtable, said more transparency was clearly needed. "This is something that complicates enormously the restructuring processes and I think one of the things where progress needs to be made," he said during an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee late on Tuesday. Loans lack mechanisms such as collective action clauses often written into bonds that help to streamline sovereign debt restructurings by allowing a majority of bondholders to bind the minority to a new deal and prevent "holdout" creditors. He also pointed to working groups such as the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt, launched in June by the British government to help make contracts clearer and more transparent, as improving the way loan terms address natural disasters, and addressing problems with group lending practices. Almost all international bond and loan contracts across emerging markets use England and New York as jurisdictions.

On Wednesday, during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, top officials gathered to discuss debt vulnerabilities in developing countries and explore solutions for improved debt management. (Source: Reuters) The meeting included top officials from the U.S. and China, alongside representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and South Africa as the current G20 president. The discussions focused on the lack of transparency in commercial bank loans, which complicates debt restructuring efforts in developing nations. Debt levels in low-income and emerging economies have generally stabilised but remain higher than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Some countries are particularly vulnerable, and elevated debt servicing obligations limit spending on essential sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure. Recent global policy shifts and cuts in foreign aid have further increased these challenges. Participants agreed on the need to improve debt restructuring processes. This includes accelerating the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, supporting countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service obligations, and enhancing transparency in debt-related processes to make financing more accessible. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu highlighted that the participation of the U.S. and China, despite ongoing trade tensions, shows their commitment to addressing high debt levels in developing countries. While progress has been made in shortening official debt restructuring timelines, more work is needed to address non-bonded debt. Non-bonded debt remains a critical concern. Countries may complete restructuring of some loans but still face bank exposures or other debts that prevent credit rating improvements. The focus now is on ensuring that countries can access lower-cost financing, with Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia, and Suriname cited as examples facing challenges. The meeting showed broad support for early and comprehensive publication of restructuring terms once agreements are reached. Participants also backed extending the World Bank’s “Debt Data Sharing Exercise” to all G20 creditors. There is growing interest in a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot programme in Indonesia. Global debt has reached record levels, yet many emerging markets have reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios. Despite this, high debt-service obligations and limited access to capital markets remain major challenges. Liquidity is currently a bigger concern than solvency, and high borrowing costs push many governments toward non-transparent loan arrangements. Private-sector creditors, including Standard Chartered and BlackRock, emphasised the need for greater transparency in loan terms. Unlike bonds, many loans lack collective action clauses, complicating restructuring processes. Initiatives like the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt aim to improve contract clarity and address issues in group lending practices. Negotiators continue to work on a G20 declaration on debt issues. The goal is to enhance transparency, streamline restructuring, and provide support to vulnerable countries. Collaboration among nations, international organisations, and creditors is critical to address the growing challenges of global debt.

Title: Newly Launched Waypoint West Puts Liquidity Planning at the Center of Its Advisory Model

October 16, 2025 00:13 ET | Source: Waypoint West Waypoint West Photo courtesy of Waypoint West. SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waypoint West, the independent wealth advisor founded earlier this month by siblings Haley and Brooks Schaffer, underscored liquidity planning as a central focus of its offering for founders and builders. According to the firm’s briefing, entrepreneurs and senior employees often hold 70–90 percent of their net worth in company equity. Without careful preparation, more than half of that wealth can be lost to taxes at the point of liquidity. At the same time, companies are remaining private for 10–12 years on average before IPO, more than double the timeline of a generation ago, forcing individuals to manage concentrated positions for longer and seek innovative ways to unlock value. The firm noted that the challenge is amplified in today’s environment, where industries such as artificial intelligence are experiencing rapid transformation. It drew parallels to the dot-com bubble, when companies like AOL and Sun Microsystems were once considered untouchable but eventually faded, while others such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft went on to become enduring leaders. The takeaway for founders and employees: concentration can feel safe inside an iconic company, but diversification is what sustains wealth. Waypoint West stated that the goal of its program is to put structure and strategy around liquidity events, positioning them as turning points for long-term financial independence rather than short-term transactions. The firm emphasized the importance of beginning planning 12 to 24 months ahead, when strategies can be coordinated across a client’s full team of advisors, including estate planners, tax specialists, and legal counsel, to maximize after-tax outcomes. The program highlights a toolkit of public-market solutions that can be customized to client needs, including options-based hedges, exchange funds, custom ETFs and direct indexing, long/short overlays, and, where appropriate, simple sale and reinvest strategies. Waypoint West noted that as an independent RIA operating in an open-architecture framework, it sources across custodians, banks, and counterparties to design the optimal mix for a client rather than relying on a single provider. The firm also pointed to the rise of private-market liquidity solutions as companies stay private longer. These include secondary sales, NAV or portfolio loans, and structured financing arrangements tied to company performance. While each approach carries trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, and signaling, Waypoint West said it helps clients evaluate these paths in the context of broader retirement, family, and philanthropic goals. By positioning liquidity as both a financial and life event, Waypoint West is seeking to fill a gap for founders, builders, and early employees who face unique challenges in converting on-paper wealth into enduring prosperity.

UPDATED 21:57 EDT / OCTOBER 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley An artificial intelligence infrastructure consortium led by Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and BlackRock Inc. today announced it’s planning to buy Aligned Data Centers LLC in a deal valued at about $40 billion. It’s one of the largest-ever acquisitions of data centers, designed to secure vast and highly coveted AI computing capacity for the consortium’s members. The consortium, known as the AI Infrastructure Partnership or AIP, was formed last year by BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed investment group MGX and Microsoft. Nvidia and Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. joined the consortium in March, along with Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Ltd. and the Kuwait Investment Authority. Founded in 2013, Aligned Data Centers has emerged as one of the major winners of the AI infrastructure spending boom. It operates a number of colocation data centers that rent capacity to customers, and it also builds data center facilities for hyperscale and enterprise firms. It currently operates data centers in Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Northern Virginia, and it’s building additional sites in Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia. In addition, it has a massive operation in Latin America, having acquired a company called OData in May 2023, which has facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It’s also an investor in the Canadian data center operator QScale SEC, which gives it a foothold in that country, too. All told, it operates 50 data centers globally, amounting to 5 gigawatts of compute capacity. In January, Aligned was boosted by a $12 billion capital injection that came from two sources – $5 billion in primary equity from its current parent company Macquarie Asset Management LLC and $7 billion in new debt commitments. Aligned’s customers include the data center software company Nutanix Inc. and the information technology services provider Datto Inc. The AIP consortium said the acquisition will help it to accelerate its mission of “advancing the infrastructure and innovation needed to power the future of AI.” “With AIP, MGX and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure,” said Aligned Data Centers Chief Executive Andrew Schaap. The acquisition is just the latest example of how big technology companies are funneling billions of dollars into the infrastructure required to power their AI innovations. The likes of Google LLC parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., CoreWeave Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft have committed to spending more than $400 billion on AI data centers this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle and SoftBank Group Corp. on the $500 billion Stargate initiative that aims to build a cluster of data centers in the U.S. In addition, the ChatGPT maker has also struck deals with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc. that may eventually be worth over $1 trillion to secure the AI accelerators needed to fill those data centers, which will have a combined capacity of around 26 gigawatts. Meta also has plans to build a number of new data centers in the U.S., including a newly announced $1.5 billion facility in Texas and a massive complex in Louisiana called “Hyperion” that’s expected to provide 5 gigawatts of capacity when it comes fully online in 2030. The enormous spending on data centers is the AI industry’s equivalent of the “gold rush”, with companies hunting for computing resources rather than precious metals, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. “It’ll take time to see if these efforts pay off, but the deal makes sense because data centers take a long time and a lot of money to build,” he said. “It’s a solid acquisition because Aligned has been building and operating data centers for years, and so this expertise will come in handy too.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Oct 16, 2025, 07:52 AM Updated Oct 16, 2025, 10:14 PM Bengaluru – An investor group including Singapore’s Temasek, BlackRock, Microsoft and Nvidia is buying one of the world’s biggest data centre operators with nearly 80 facilities in a deal worth US$40 billion (S$51.8 billion) to secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence (AI). The deal is the biggest-ever data centre transaction as companies race to lock in AI computing power. Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Texas, currently has 50 campuses in the US and South America. It has 78 data centres under management or in future development, according to its website. Its purchase from Australia’s Macquarie Asset Management on Oct 15 is also the first deal for the AI Infrastructure Partnership, formed in 2024. The partnership includes Temasek, the Kuwait Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX and Mr Elon Musk’s start-up xAI among its backers. “With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI,” said BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who also serves as the chairman of the AI Infrastructure Partnership. The acquisition is the latest in a series of big-ticket deals involving big tech and Silicon Valley start-ups, which the boom in AI has fuelled. Major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft and CoreWeave are on track to spend US$400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Morgan Stanley estimates. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom that may cost over US$1 trillion to secure about 26GW of computing capacity, enough to power roughly 20 million US homes. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks Meta Platforms is building several multi-gigawatt AI data centres, including one called Prometheus, due to come online in 2026, and another, Hyperion, which can scale up to 5GW. Privately held Aligned Data Centers currently has over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Mr Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Nvidia shareholder Equity Armor Investments, said the acquisition highlights the growing value of data centre assets for investors. “They’re looking at rapid expansion to meet AI demand and optimise for it.” Founded in 2013, Aligned has been a big winner of the AI infrastructure spending boom, raising US$12 billion in equity and debt earlier in 2025 – one of the largest private capital injections into a data centre company. Its customers include cloud computing platform Nutanix and information technology services provider Datto, according to its website. The company also has a land portfolio with access to significant near-term power capacity in key markets, said Macquarie, which first invested in the company in 2018. Shares of its publicly-listed rivals, such as Applied Digital, have soared more than fourfold in 2025. Applied Digital shares jumped 5 per cent on Oct 15. The investment group buying Aligned has an initial target of deploying US$30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching US$100 billion including debt. It has not disclosed how much each partner has contributed to the group nor the equity value of the deal. Nvidia and Aligned declined to comment, while the investors did not immediately respond to requests seeking more details on the deal. “All the major parties in that consortium, they are showing the strength of the AI ecosystem,” said Mr Hendi Susanto, portfolio manager at Nvidia investor Gabelli Funds. Aligned will remain headquartered in Dallas, Texas, under CEO Andrew Schaap when the deal closes in the first half of 2026, the investor group said in its statement.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 Billion AI Deal Exposes Massive Arbitrage Opportunity for Bitcoin Miners

Written byCamila Grigera Naón Edited byMohammad Shahid The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), a consortium led by BlackRock’s GIP with members like Nvidia, Microsoft, and xAI, is purchasing Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie for a record-high $40 billion to expand vital AI capacity. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel argues this deal creates a significant arbitrage opportunity for undervalued Bitcoin miners to significantly re-rate their stock by hosting high-demand AI computing. A powerful investment consortium is acquiring Aligned Data Centers from Macquarie Asset Management in a record-breaking deal that values the company at approximately $40 billion. The consortium, known as the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), is led by BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). It includes tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Elon Musk’s xAI, and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm MGX. By acquiring Aligned Data Centers, the consortium gains a massive portfolio of specialized, high-density data centers. This infrastructure provides over 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity across the Americas. This scale is essential for hosting the computationally demanding workloads that next-generation AI and cloud platforms require. The move also secures ownership of Aligned’s cooling technology, a critical component for managing the extreme heat generated by AI hardware. The purchase marks AIP’s first investment. The deal is slated to finalize during the first six months of 2026. It’s also expected to have positive spillover effects for Bitcoin miners. In a social media post, Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, broke down the meaning of acquisition for the mining sector. The analyst determined that the $40 billion price tag, when spread across 5 gigawatts of the company’s planned power capacity, means the consortium is paying $8 million for every megawatt. BLACKROCK & NVIDIA IN $40 B DATA CENTER TAKEOVER:Macquarie is selling Aligned Data Centers for $40B, with press reports noting the platform is “poised to expand its capacity to over 5GW.”>Implies a valuation of roughly $8M per MW of total data-center capacity (operating +… pic.twitter.com/hkwNjgVe8H Sigel pointed out that publicly traded Bitcoin miners such as Riot Platforms, Hut 8, and IREN appear significantly undervalued by the stock market. Despite owning the same massive electrical infrastructure, their assets are valued at just $3 million per megawatt. This $5 million per megawatt difference gives miners a significant financial advantage, representing a hidden arbitrage opportunity. These companies can unlock this value by adapting their facilities to host high-demand AI computing in addition to Bitcoin mining. “Bitcoin miners already control some of the largest privately held power and land footprints in North America,” Sigel told BeInCrypto. The stock market currently views Bitcoin mining firms as volatile “crypto companies.” However, signing stable, long-term contracts with major AI providers can prove that their sites are valuable power hubs. “Recent deals like this one confirm that electrical capacity, not just compute, is the scarcest resource in the AI economy. The market is starting to realize that miners own the energy and grid interconnects [what] everyone else now needs,” Sigel added. This shift would allow the market to “re-rate” their company valuation closer to the levels of pure data center businesses. Sigel suggested this change could lead to a substantial 150% to 500% increase in stock value for current shareholders. Meanwhile, long-term AI contracts offer stable, guaranteed income. This is crucial for securing loans for upgrades and avoiding stock dilution for current shareholders.

Title: SL Green Buying Blackstone’s Park Avenue Tower for $730M: Sources

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Blackstone is officially under contract to sell Park Avenue Tower for nearly the same price the 36-story office building fetched 11 years ago. SL Green will acquire the 622,000-square-foot property at 65 East 55th Street for $730 million, sources told Commercial Observer. Blackstone subsidiary EQ Office (now known as Perform Properties) purchased the Midtown Manhattan office asset for $750 million in 2014 from Shorenstein Company. Eastdil Secured’s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the latest megadeal, sources said, which went under contract yesterday. The sale of Park Avenue Tower is being executed nearly a decade after EQ Office undertook a $25 million renovation project following the exit of the building’s anchor tenant, law firm Paul Hastings, which relocated to the MetLife Building, as CO reported at the time. Perform Properties inked a 17,458-square-foot lease from Reinsurance Group of America in August, to house the St. Louis-based global reinsurance firm’s first New York office, CO previously reported. Other tenants include Panagram Structured Asset Management and Quilvest Capital Partners. Just last month, SL Green also snapped up 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th Street for $160 million just last month. “This acquisition will deliver sustainable cash flow and provide long-term value creation while further solidifying our commitment to being the leading owner of premier properties along Park Avenue at a time when demand has never been higher,” Harrison Sitomer, chief investment officer at SL Green, said in a statement announcing the Park Avenue Tower acquisition. “Park Avenue Tower is strategically located and well-leased at below-market rents, offering significant upside as vacancy in the Park Avenue corridor continues to trend below six percent.” The property in the deal was part of a Blackstone fund that is 95 percent realized and generated a 14 percent internal rate of return. “This successful exit from a substantially realized fund capitalizes on the strong rebound in demand for office in Midtown Manhattan and demonstrates the momentum for recently renovated office assets in prime submarkets,” the Blackstone spokesperson said in a statement. Eastdil Secured did not immediately return a request for comment. Andrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

A consortium led by BlackRock, including Nvidia and Microsoft, will acquire Aligned Data Centres for US$40 billion ($69.9b). Photo / Getty Images A consortium led by asset manager BlackRock, including chip giant Nvidia and Microsoft, is set to acquire data centre specialist Aligned Data Centres from Australian financial services group Macquarie for approximately US$40 billion ($69.9b). The deal marks another sign of the tech sector’s insatiable appetite for AI infrastructure, including chips, servers, and data centres that provide the computing storage and processing power required by artificial intelligence. And it comes on the heels of Macquarie’s A$23b deal to sell Australian and Asia Pacific data centre operator AirTrunk to Blackstone for A$23.5b and the rise and rise in valuation of Canberra Data Centres, half-owned by NZX-listed Infratil. On October 7, Infratil said the latest 2025 independent valuation of CDC showed an increase of A$77 million since June 30 to A$13.6b, making its 49.72% stake worth a new high of A$6.8b. Founded in 2013, Aligned currently operates more than 50 data centres across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, with a projected capacity exceeding 5 gigawatts. Macquarie initially acquired a stake in the Texas-based company in 2018 through its subsidiary Macquarie Asset Management and subsequently increased its investment in 2020. The acquiring consortium consists of BlackRock, Emirati sovereign tech fund MGX, and the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), a joint venture established by BlackRock in 2024 that includes BlackRock, MGX, Nvidia, and Microsoft. AIP plans to raise US$30b in direct investments and leverage debt to achieve a total investment capacity of US$100b. The partners have not disclosed how equity will be distributed among Aligned’s new shareholders following the transaction’s completion, expected in the first half of 2026. “We are entering a new era in which AI will fundamentally re-engineer our economies and enable accelerated growth,” said Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, CEO of MGX and vice-chairman of AIP, in a press release. BlackRock CEO and AIP chairman Larry Fink said the acquisition enabled its clients to participate in the growth of AI. -Agence France-Presse with Herald staff After 75 years on NZ shelves, Reader’s Digest has moved on to the digital world.

Title: Argentina First? Trump Treasury Sec Reveals Bailout Amount Has Doubled
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/201811/donald-trump-treasury-secretary-argentina-bailout-doubled
Time Published: 2025-10-15T18:56:32Z
Full Content:
One day after Donald Trump celebrated a multibillion-dollar bailout for Argentina, his administration moved to double the ante. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters at the Treasury building Wednesday that the United States is “working on a $20 billion facility that would be adjacent” to the $20 billion credit swap line Trump already approved, totaling $40 billion in assistance for the economically fragile South American country. “Many banks are interested in it, and many sovereign funds,” Bessent said. “It is a private-sector solution to Argentina’s upcoming debt payments.” The aid is intended to salvage Argentina’s collapsing economy ahead of the country’s October 26 midterm elections. That vote will determine if Argentine President Javier Milei, one of Trump’s international allies, will maintain the ability to pursue his dramatic cost-cutting agenda. But there’s another notable beneficiary of the Trump admin’s Argentina bailout package: major hedge funds led by Bessent’s friends. Several major investment funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, stand to significantly gain from the aid transfer, as do several independent investors with ties to Bessent, The New York Times reported earlier this month. Bessent described the exchange Wednesday as an “economic Monroe Doctrine,” referring to the 1823 policy that rejected European intervention and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. “Much better to use the heft of the U.S. economic power rather than have to use military power,” Bessent continued, comparing the situation to the supposed “narco traffic coming out of Venezuela.” But the White House’s planned Argentina bailout is remarkably hypocritical for an administration that has axed critical executive agencies under the auspice of slashing spending. Stateside, the government is still shut down over how to fund Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included cuts of billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid—a shutdown that Bessent himself claimed Wednesday was costing America “$15 billion a day.” And the U.S. will likely need a bailout of its own very soon. American soybean farmers have been pummeled by Trump’s tariff policies, which have ripped the Chinese market from their grasp. However, after it came to light that Argentina had replaced the U.S. as China’s top soybean supplier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the anticipated Argentina-bound cash infusion had morphed into a “credit swap line.” House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that harassment, assault, and stolen valor allegations against Republican Representative Cory Mills are not “serious” matters of discussion at a Wednesday press conference. A Florida judge on Tuesday issued a restraining order against Mills, after his ex-girlfriend alleged that he had threatened to blackmail her using sexually explicit images of her and to commit violence against her future romantic partners. Johnson bristled at reporters after being asked twice about the matter. Responding to a question from NBC News’s Melanie Zanona, Johnson initially claimed to have “not heard or looked into the details of that.” NOTUS’s Reese Gorman followed up, noting additional scandals—two out of a bevy of others—that Mills has faced, i.e., a different woman once accused him of assaulting her at his apartment, which she since recanted, and Mills, an Army veteran, has also been accused of stolen valor, including by military veterans who served alongside him. “Are you concerned about these allegations?” Gorman asked. Johnson told him to ask Mills, whom he called “a faithful colleague,” before pleading ignorance of the allegations. “Let’s talk about things that are really serious,” said the speaker, growing cross, before taking another question. Federal agents arrested a Portland mother who was playing the “Ghostbusters” theme song on her clarinet at a protest outside an ICE facility. Oriana Korol, 38, is a member of the Unpresidented Brass Band, which calls itself a “social action oriented, horn driven marching band,” and seeks to deescalate protest tensions. In a video of her arrest from Sunday, a federal agent can be seen violently dragging Korol to the ground, as two more agents come to his aid and her clarinet falls out of her hands. She has been in Clark County Jail in Vancouver, Washington, since, and is still being held without bail. Video of the Portland clarinet player being arrested.Honestly ditching the black bloc in favor of silly costumes, naked bike rides & brass bands is politically quite ingenious. It makes ICE look utterly foolish in any footage that appears on the news average Joe watches. pic.twitter.com/FY87x9xKGr “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone running, and then a federal officer running after them. By the time I turned around, this person had been tackled to the ground, and there was an officer on top of them,” said Mike Thompson, Korol’s bandleader. “This was happening right at Oriana’s feet. And she was kind of, they were kind of pinned against a fence,” he said. Korol’s husband didn’t know she’d been transported across state lines until 2 a.m. the next morning. “It is a beautiful party atmosphere. Everybody’s really excited. Then the band hits into ‘Ghostbusters,’ and then at ‘Ghostbusters,’ that’s when ICE start storming in,” Korol’s husband told KOIN 6. “Why are they targeting a clarinet player? A clarinet player standing on the sidewalk far away from the street, following instructions. “We’re not seeing her. We don’t know when we’re going to see her again,” he added, referring to himself and their 3-year-old child. This arrest is yet another example of the excessive, indiscriminate, and in some instances unlawful actions that the federal agents who’ve flooded American cities in the past few months have taken. On Tuesday, federal agents in Chicago violated a freshly minted temporary restraining order banning them from tear-gassing civilians, also gassing local police officers in the process. The Portland Mutual Aid Network has called for Korol’s release, urging supporters to call the Clark County Jail. “Oriana Korol was peacefully protesting ICE on 10/12 and was illegally detained by ICE and DHS,” their statement reads. “She is the clarinet player for Unpresidented Brass Band, and was playing music for protestors. Protesting for immigrants is not a crime!” Republicans are rushing to recast upcoming protests against President Donald Trump as anti-American rallies that are somehow prolonging the government shutdown. During an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the Democrats for a lack of movement on reopening the federal government, claiming that they were waiting to move until after the “No Kings Day” rally planned for October 18 opposing the administration’s authoritarian tilt. “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting to get this crazy ‘No Kings’ rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest-core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party which is, you know, a big title,” Bessent claimed. “You know, no kings equal no paychecks,” he added. During a propaganda press conference later Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson framed the upcoming “No Kings Day” as a “Hate America rally.” “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said. “I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display. The people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” Other Republicans were quick to join Johnson, with Representatives Steve Scalise and Lisa McClain also referring to the protest as the “Hate America rally.” Johnson started the trend of villainizing constitutionally protected protest last week when he inexplicably claimed that the “No Kings Day” demonstration was somehow to blame for the government shutdown. “It’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally, ’cuz they can’t face their rabid base,” Johnson said of Democrats at the time. For the past three weeks, GOP lawmakers have been phoning in that whole defending-the-Republic thing, ever since Johnson sent them home amid the ongoing government shutdown. It seems clear that it’s Republicans who have refused to negotiate with Democrats—not the other way around. Crucially, Republicans are blatantly mischaracterizing the attendees of the nationwide “No Kings” rally, in an attempt to criminalize dissent against Trump. These protests, which have been recurring since the beginning of the second Trump administration, have been notably tame, reportedly populated by older, liberal white people who love America but hate Trump’s policies. The temperate collective action would likely not be left enough for anyone who was ostensibly anti-fascist. Republicans’ outlandish predictions for who is likely to attend are simply setting the stage for law enforcement crackdowns on protesters’ First Amendment rights. The speaker’s suggestion that protesting the government is un-American is particularly disturbing, as it is not only a historically American activity, but also a foundational right supported by the U.S. Constitution—a right that Republicans such as Johnson seem to care about less and less everyday. The largest political advertisement spender of the year is: you, the U.S. taxpayer. While the rest of the Trump administration hatchets away at the federal budget, the Department of Homeland Security has gone on a spending spree to heap praise on Donald Trump. The agency has so far spent at least $51 million in 2025 on a sprawling ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to either exit the country or be “hunted down.” Fox News bought the bulk of the ad spots, airing $9 million worth of content, Axios reported Wednesday. America’s morning shows saw the most program-specific spending, with Today, CBS Morning, and Good Morning America leading the pack. Over the course of the last month, viewers of three programs consumed the most DHS advertising: the Mexican soccer league (Fútbol: Liga MX), Fox’s The Five, and Univision’s Despierta America. But the campaign has also had a digital arm targeting social media users. The ads have specifically targeted Spanish speakers and users who like Mexican pop music, Latin music, the Mexican Grand Prix, Latin cuisine, and the Mexican national soccer team, according to Meta ad library data obtained by Axios. Almost all the adverts feature DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Directly facing the camera, Noem suggests that undocumented immigrants are “violent criminals” flooding American cities with drugs, and accuses the Biden administration of taking a weak stance on border crossings. (Joe Biden increased border enforcement across the board and arrested an “unprecedented” number of immigrants that crossed illegally, according to the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.) One detail is consistent across all the DHS adspots: unmitigated applause for the current president’s agenda. “Strong borders mean a stronger America. President Trump is making America safe again,” Noem says at the end of one advert. Compare that to DHS’s last ad campaign under the Biden administration: a series of billboards in Texas that read a person “in immigration custody has rights.” That campaign cost $150,000, and did not feature President Joe Biden or former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In a now infamous September raid on a 130-unit apartment building in Chicago, hundreds of agents reportedly rappelled in from helicopters, kicked in doors, ransacked rooms, deployed flashbangs, and zip-tied people—immigrants and native Chicagoans, adults and children—in the middle of the night. Amid growing criticism of this heavy-handed blitz, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller defended the operation, calling it a “brilliantly executed raid against a Tren de Aragua complex filled with TdA terrorists.” (Tren de Aragua, or TdA, is a Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration, with characteristic alarmism, claims has “invaded the United States.”) So, how many members of the Venezuelan gang did they catch in the controversial September raid? DHS says that, of the 37 individuals arrested that night, agents got ahold of “just one ‘verified’ Tren de Aragua member,” MSNBC reported this week. It was previously reported that two of the 37 arrested were members of TdA, but even that disappointing figure was evidently overstating it. Further, DHS has yet to provide proof of the alleged gang member’s connection to TdA—a point worth noting, since the Trump administration has faced criticism for advancing weak claims of immigrants’ gang membership in service of its mass deportation campaign. This new finding lends itself to the conclusions Illinois Governor JB Pritzker shared in his recent conversation with TNR’s Greg Sargent about the raid: “If this was Pinochet’s Chile, if this was Argentina under authoritarian rule, maybe you’d call it successful,” he said, adding later, “Whenever the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and [Customs and Border Protection] agents say something, they put out a release or, you know, you’ve got Stephen Miller talking about it, they are lying.” Federal agents ended up tear-gassing Chicago police officers on Tuesday while trying to perform basic crowd control, violating a temporary restraining order banning the very use of tear gas in the process. A crowd of community members and protesters formed near 105th and Avenue N, where Border Patrol struck a civilian car while trying to arrest the people inside. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said that the crowd “eventually turned hostile,” forcing them to use “crowd control measures” like tear gas. CPD officers present were caught in the crossfire. About 13 officers were exposed to the tear gas, Chicago police said. This is the second time CPD officers have been gassed by ICE while trying to work with them. The federal agents are also blatantly ignoring the temporary restraining order sent down from Judge Sara Ellis on October 9, after journalists and community organizations brought the issue forward. Ellis explicitly banned the agents from “using riot control weapons,” “firing [tear gas] canisters,” “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual,” “striking any person with a vehicle,” and more abuses of power. The order applies to all agents from the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE and Border Patrol, and was supposed to last until October 23. The federal agents violated it almost immediately. Civilians have continued to be terrorized by these riot tactics. “The eyes and the nose ... it burned,” community member Pascal Manuel told NBC 5 Investigates. “This type of escalation is going to cause harm—it’s not the people of Chicago. It is the federal agents,” said Beatriz Ponce De Leon, Chicago’s deputy mayor of immigration and refugee rights. There is currently no update on the status of the temporary restraining order. Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana appeared dumbstruck Tuesday night after his ridiculous attempts to blame Democrats for massive funding cuts to energy projects blew up in his face. During an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sheehy was asked about the $1 billion grant that the Department of Energy pulled from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a clean energy project spanning Washington state, Oregon, and Montana. “They just yanked a billion dollars from that. So, is that taking away good paying jobs in Montana?” asked Collins. “Of course it is. As I said, we want the government to be open. You should be saying this to Chuck Schumer, who is closing the government down,” Sheehy replied. “I’m agreeing we should have the government open right now, this is an unnecessary shutdown.” Collins pressed whether Sheehy was acknowledging that President Donald Trump’s administration was hurting his state, prompting the Republican to launch into an unrelated list of federal services interrupted by the government shutdown. “So, this shutdown is not a good thing, and that’s why we don’t want it to continue,” he said. Collins tried to steer Sheehy back to the topic at hand. “The Trump administration didn’t have to make that decision, they decided to pull that billion dollars from your state,” she said. “Do you disagree with that?” “Well, I think the reality is we wouldn’t be here if the government was still open, and now we’re going on week three of a pretty unnecessary shutdown,” Sheehy repeated. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright had specifically told Collins earlier this month that the canceled grant had nothing to do with the shutdown, or the Democrats, for that matter. “He said they would’ve done that even if the government wasn’t shut down, that that was months in the making even before the government shut down,” Collins said. The two fell silent, as Sheehy’s desperate excuses evaporated. After a long moment, Sheehy replied: “Well, it’s unfortunate we’re still shut down. We shouldn’t be.” COLLINS: The Dept of Energy just canceled a billion dollars for a hydrogen hub that covers your state of Montana. Is that taking away good-paying jobs?SHEEHY: Of course it is. We want the govt to be openCOLLINS: But the Energy Secretary says they would've pulled that funding… pic.twitter.com/6AAfmldQf8 Last week, OMB Director Russell Vought—not Wright—declared that the Trump administration would cut nearly $8 billion in lawfully approved funding for energy projects, targeting 16 Democratic-led states. A longer list of grants to clean energy projects assembled by DOE senior staff totaling roughly $30 billion circulated Capitol Hill, alarming energy advocates and lawmakers, including Republicans whose districts could be affected by the cuts. The fate of the remaining $22 billion, which is mostly earmarked for Republican districts, remains unclear. An opinion on Charlie Kirk could be what keeps people in or out of America. The State Department announced Tuesday it has revoked at least six visas from foreign nationals after their recipients made comments about Kirk in the wake of the far-right youth leader’s assassination. So far, individuals from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Paraguay are affected. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the State Department wrote on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Exactly what qualifies for expulsion is not clear, though some of the remarks were notably benign. An Argentine national who had their visa revoked said that Kirk spread “racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric”—all of which is demonstrably true. That language in particular has even been circulated by House lawmakers in criticizing Kirk’s point of view. In a string of social media posts, the official account for the State Department shared several examples of the comments that caught its attention from individuals “who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” The State Department claimed that nearly all of the examples suggested the commenters were attempting to justify Kirk’s death. “Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and he died by his own rules,” wrote the Paraguayan national. A German, writing in German, commented that “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain.” The State Department warned in an X post that “[President Donald Trump] and [Secretary Marco Rubio] will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws.” “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the department wrote. Vice President JD Vance late Tuesday decried “pearl clutching” over a Politico story unearthing a private group chat in which prominent members of Young Republicans chapters called Black people monkeys, spoke approvingly of rape and slavery, and wrote other odious remarks, such as “I love Hitler” and messages containing racial and homophobic slurs. Opting for whataboutism, Vance highlighted unearthed messages by Jay Jones, a Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, who recently apologized for leaked private messages from August 2022, in which he joked about shooting then-state House Speaker Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones also said Gilbert would not take action on gun safety unless his children were endangered, writing, “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy.” Vance posted a screenshot of the latter comment on X, with the caption: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.” For one, it’s not a matter of fact that Jones’s messages are worse than those of the Young Republicans, who spoke about having their political opponents raped and sent to gas chambers. Vance is also trying to downplay the importance of the messages by claiming they were shared in a “college group chat.” But Young Republicans groups include those between 18 and 40 years old, with members of the reported group chat well into adulthood. The man Politico identifies as “the most prominent voice in the chat spreading racist messages,” for instance, is 31. The members held notable positions in Republican politics, with several leading state affiliates of the GOP’s youth arm. Some worked in state politics, and at least one serves as a state senator. Vance’s tweet exemplifies his time-tested willingness to excuse vitriol in his own ranks, embracing a “no-enemies-to-the-right” stance that is seemingly limitless.

Title: Did A Cyber School Giant Try To Hide Its Troubles By Attacking A Public School?

ByPeter Greene, Senior Contributor. Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. "Our students deserve better," said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release. "This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law." Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins." The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin." According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education." And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Elison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, "despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012." In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their "epic series of tech errors." K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners.

Title: Abu Dhabi Fund MGX Emerges As Key Player In Two Major Trump-Era Deals

ByZach Everson, Forbes Staff. MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi fund, has surfaced in two of the most scrutinized deals in Donald Trump’s second term—it’s reportedly set to take a stake in TikTok’s U.S. business and used a Trump-linked stablecoin for a $2 billion transaction that may have benefited the president’s family financially. The Abu Dhabi government created MGX in March 2024 as a technology investment company, tasked with “accelerat[ing] the development and adoption of AI and advanced technologies” through global partnerships, according to a launch announcement. MGX was launched by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, and G42, an artificial intelligence holding company, in which Microsoft has invested $1.5 billion. The fund targets semiconductors, infrastructure, software, tech-enabled services, life sciences and automation services, with past investments in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Altera and Binance. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan chairs MGX’s board—he’s also the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ National Security Adviser and chair of G42’s board as well as those of four other companies. MGX’s CEO, Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, studied at MIT, worked in investment banking and previously oversaw private equity investments at Mubadala. Asked about the TikTok talks, MGX chief communications officer Noelle Camilleri told Forbes, “On TikTok, we don’t have anything to share at this time.” In April 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States over privacy and data concerns, effective January 2025. The ban was never enforced, and on Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order, “Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security,” that would allow the platform to remain available. The executive order paves the way for U.S. investors to take majority control, while the Chinese parent company ByteDance’s stake will drop to less than 20%. The new owners have not been confirmed but, citing unnamed sources, CNBC reported that MGX, Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake will be the main investors, owning a combined 45% of TikTok USA. Oracle and Silver Lake did not respond to inquiries. On Wednesday, MGX announced it was teaming with the Artificial Infrastructure Partnership and BlackRock to buy Aligned Data Centers in a deal that values the company, which has 50 facilities, at $40 billion. The TikTok deal is not the first time MGX has been tied to Trump’s administration. The day after his second inauguration, Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed by MGX, OpenAI, Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank. And earlier in September, MGX joined Silver Lake in buying a 51% stake in Altera, Intel’s programmable-chip unit. The U.S. government owns 9.9% of Intel, after taking the extraordinary step of purchasing an $8.9 billion stake as part of the Trump administration’s semiconductor strategy. Final terms of the TikTok restructuring are not publicly known, including how large a stake MGX may take and what governance rights it could secure. Another open question is whether MGX will use the Trump-linked USD1 in future deals. $100 billion: The amount MGX hopes to have under management within a few years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. World Liberty Financial says it was “inspired by the vision of Donald J. Trump” and lists him as co-founder emeritus, alongside co-founders Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Barron Trump. According to the company’s website, an LLC affiliated with the Trump family owns about 38% of World Liberty Financial, which issues the USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoin issuers typically earn interest on the reserves backing their tokens, such as U.S. Treasurys and cash equivalents. In May, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff said MGX would use $2 billion worth of USD1 to invest in the crypto exchange Binance. That choice effectively placed $2 billion of reserves with USD1’s custodian, potentially increasing the interest income for World Liberty Financial’s owners. The transaction also helped lift USD1’s market cap, aiding its scale and visibility. As of 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, USD1’s $2.7 billion market cap made it the sixth-largest stablecoin, according to CoinGecko, a crypto analytics firm. Also, two weeks after Witkoff announced the deal, the Trump administration agreed to allow the UAE to buy advanced computer chips from U.S. companies, the New York Times reported. One company set to benefit from the deal: G42, a founding partner of MGX, which Tahnoon chairs. (Although that deal is delayed, with some administration officials concerned about G42’s involvement, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. G42 did not respond to Forbes’ inquiry.) An MGX spokesperson told Forbes that Binance asked to settle in cryptocurrency and both sides opted for a stablecoin to limit volatility. Binance’s said that while its client “did not control the payment method chosen by MGX,” it welcomed the use of a stablecoin. MGX said it evaluated stablecoins on business suitability, the jurisdiction and currency of the reserves, and compliance history, then chose USD1 because it is fully reserved in U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by an independent U.S. custodian and audited. MGX added that it did not invest in World Liberty Financial, paid no fees and doesn’t hold USD1 today. MGX said it weighed “compliance history” in picking USD1, but that claim doesn’t match the timeline: MGX announced its $2 billion Binance investment on March 12, and World Liberty Financial didn’t unveil USD1 until March 25—leaving little track record to assess. Another firm Tahnoon chairs, G42, already had owned a stake in ByteDance but divested it after in response to U.S. lawmakers concerns about his ties to China. In January 2024, a Republican-led House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged the Commerce Department to impose export controls on G42—an AI holding company that helped found MGX—after an investigation found G42 had ties to Huawei and other blacklisted Chinese companies. The probe also linked G42 affiliates to a scientist accused of stealing U.S. military-funded research from UCLA to establish a government lab in Beijing. The following month, G42 divested from Chinese companies—including what had been a $100 million stake in ByteDance, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal. In April, Microsoft announced its $1.5 billion investment in G42 and a partnership to accelerate AI in the UAE. After MGX’s use of USD1 became public, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined by 11 other Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., filed a resolution to enforce the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars presidents from “accept[ing] of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without Congress’ consent. Senate Republicans blocked the measure. Separately, Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to Binance and MGX, asking why they used USD1 instead of fiat or another cryptocurrency. Any responses have not been made public, and Binance’s attorney declined to share details on any response it sent beyond saying its client “conducted themselves entirely properly with regard to the MGX investment.” The senators also asked the Office of Government Ethics to weigh in, but it has not responded. “You probably don’t have to scratch very deep to find an instance where the president has received an enormous infusion of cash to his crypto coin from a CEO or foreign oligarch who is then asking for a favor from Donald Trump,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC in May. Since 2008, MGX vice chair Khaldoon Al Mubarak also has chaired Manchester City Football Club. Forbes ranks the team no. 5 on its list of the world’s most valuable sports franchises, estimating it’s worth $5.3 billion.

Title: BlackRock-led Consortium Buys Aligned Data Centers for $40B

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The AI revolution is expensive, but a group of investors led by BlackRock aren’t shy to open their wallets. The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), founded late last year by BlackRock, NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX, bought Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. The deal, which also included BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), is aimed at funding next-generation cloud and AI computing infrastructure. Australia-based Macquarie Asset Management sold the equity. Founded in 2013, Aligned has emerged as a leader in the data center space with more than 5 gigawatts of current and planned capacity across 50 global campuses. Aligned’s portfolio is found across Northern Virginia (which include two hyperscale campuses in Sterling and Ashburn), Chicago, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Ohio, São Paulo, Brazil, Queretaro, Mexico and Santiago, Chile. The consortium — financially anchored by the Kuwait Investment Authority and Singapore’s state-owned Temasek Holdings — plans to accelerate that growth, though expansion details were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Aligned will stay headquartered in Dallas with CEO Andrew Schapp at the helm. “AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale.” Aligned’s trajectory is emblematic of the sheer energy surrounding data center investment. The company earlier this year raised roughly $12 billion in capital, split between equity and debt, in one of the largest-ever private sector investments in a data center developer. Indeed, tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others are expected to spend some $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year alone, according to Morgan Stanley.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off: IBIT ETF Breaks $100 Billion Barrier

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to statements made on CNBC, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has topped $100 billion in assets under management less than two years after it launched. That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand. BlackRock’s move signals a larger reality: digital assets are now part of mainstream finance. Fink’s change in tone — from caution to active investment — reflects that shift. The presence of a major manager with hundreds of thousands of BTC and a growing set of tokenized offerings will influence how investors view crypto exposure.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Today’s announcement that a group of investors led by BlackRock has agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal underscores the seemingly unstoppable flow of money into AI data centers—and comes as its CEO, Larry Fink, pushes back on AI bubble fears. The deal to buy Aligned, which is owned by Macquarie Asset Management, is being inked by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP)—a coalition formed in September 2024 by BlackRock, its infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as Microsoft, Nvidia, and MGX, an AI investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI, and Temasek joined as additional participants. The AIP was formed to invest up to $30 billion of equity capital in AI, data centers, and energy; this is its first deal, which ranks as one of BlackRock’s largest infrastructure investments to date. If completed, it would be among the largest data center transactions on record, and regardless it underscores how Wall Street is racing to claim a stake in the AI boom. Fink has rejected the idea that AI infrastructure spending represents a dangerous bubble, arguing that massive data center build-outs are essential if the U.S. is to remain the global leader. “Well, there’s a bubble in investing,” he said on CNBC Squawk Box yesterday. “But are we inferring a bubble means a bad thing? There is certainly a skyrocketing amount of capital being put to work. If you put it in a framework of geopolitical positioning, we as a country need these investments if we’re going to be the leader in AI technology.” Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Plano, Texas, was founded in 2013 to build and operate data centers for hyperscalers and cloud-computing companies. It has data centers across the U.S.—including in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City—as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile. The timing of the deal comes as Big Tech firms race to secure scarce land, power, and compute capacity—the foundational resources underpinning the AI race. For example, over the past few weeks, OpenAI has announced multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD in order to lock in the computing power the company needs. “We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” Altman told reporters during a media event at OpenAI and Oracle’s flagship 800-acre Stargate data center location in Abilene, Texas, last month, where he also announced the companies will build five massive new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. OpenAI is far from alone: Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals in the past two months with U.K.-based data center developer Nscale, including the announcement today of a new site in Texas that will have capacity of as much as 240 megawatts of power. Also today, Meta announced it would invest $1.5 billion in an AI data center in El Paso, Texas, that could scale to 1 gigawatt, making it one of the largest planned data center campuses in the U.S. The total numbers are staggering: On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. And McKinsey said U.S. data center demand, driven largely by AI, could triple by 2030, and require data centers to make nearly $7 trillion in investments to keep up. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset. The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%.

The funds were launched by prestigious asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, and had the most successful launch in the history of ETFs, with Ethereum funds following in summer last year.

A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% in morning trading. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.
