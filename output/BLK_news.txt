FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has invested $200 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The investment was split evenly between the two cryptocurrencies. This marks a significant move by institutional players re-entering the digital assets market. https://twitter.com/binance/status/1957985943966892063 Founders Fund began purchasing Bitcoin in 2014 but had liquidated its holdings before the market crash in 2022. The firm initially bought Bitcoin when it was valued below $30,000. With the current price at $50,000, this investment has yielded an unrealized profit of about 66%. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1958745372978827422 Joey Krug, former co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, joined Founders Fund as a partner in April 2023. The firm has previously invested in Paxos, the NFT platform Royal, and the decentralized autonomous organization BitDAO. Thiel, a long-time proponent of digital assets, stated back in 2017 that people underestimate Bitcoin’s potential. https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1958187196609163377 In October 2020, the billionaire expressed regret over insufficient investments in the leading cryptocurrency. Venture capitalists are benefiting from an ether rally this year. Proponents see Ethereum becoming the platform of choice for the financial world. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1957840067474416095 Ether, the cryptocurrency long overshadowed by bitcoin, has surged about 13.5% this month. Investment firms own 7.5% of ETHZilla, which recently transformed itself from a biotech company to focus on selling shares to buy ether. Its stock tripled in value in one day last week after investment disclosures, though it has since fallen some. Investment firms also control 9.1% of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which has seen its value surge more than 1,000% since late June. The company now has a market value of $8.3 billion. Recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing. Bulls also hope Ethereum will become a popular platform for launching new financial products. Tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already operate on the Ethereum network, as does the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund. Activity on Ethereum amounted to more than $1.2 trillion this year, compared with $960 billion during the same time frame last year, according to data from The Block. Betting on ether remains risky. It isn’t clear that Ethereum will become widely used in finance. Some activity on the network appears to be spam-related, including nefarious phishing attacks. Nonetheless, the Trump administration’s embrace of cryptocurrencies adds momentum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that stablecoins, many of which are traded on Ethereum, could play a role in reining in the national debt by driving demand for U.S. Treasurys. In August 2025, billionaire investor Peter Thiel made a seismic move in the crypto landscape by acquiring a 7.5% stake in ETHZilla, a company aggressively accumulating Ethereum. Through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, Thiel now holds 11.6 million shares of ETHZilla, which has committed to an aggressive accumulation strategy. Thiel’s investment in ETHZilla is part of a calculated strategy to position Ethereum as a “productive asset” rather than a purely speculative one. ETHZilla has raised $425 million through private placements and $156 million via convertible notes, using the funds to acquire 82,186 ETH (worth $349 million at the time of purchase). The institutional adoption of Ethereum is accelerating as companies treat ETH as a strategic balance sheet asset. Over 1.74 million ETH—valued at $6.5 billion—is now held by publicly traded firms like Coinbase and Bit Digital. These entities are not merely accumulating ETH but are deploying it on-chain to generate returns. Ethereum’s yield advantage is significant when compared to traditional fixed-income instruments. While U.S. Treasury bonds offer 4.5% and corporate bonds 5–7%, Ethereum’s staking yield is bolstered by its potential for price appreciation. While Ethereum’s institutional adoption is robust, risks remain. Validator slashing (up to 10% loss of staked ETH) and liquidity constraints due to Ethereum’s withdrawal queue are operational challenges. However, these are mitigated by Ethereum’s energy-efficient PoS model and regulatory clarity. For investors, Ethereum’s institutional adoption presents a clear opportunity. The ETH/BTC price ratio has broken above its 365-day moving average, signaling institutional preference for Ethereum. Analysts project ETH to reach $7,709 by 2026, driven by corporate treasury accumulation and ETF inflows. As companies like ETHZilla, BitMine, and SharpLink Gaming demonstrate, Ethereum’s yield-generating capabilities and programmable infrastructure make it a superior treasury asset. For investors, this signals the dawn of a new bull market—one driven by institutional confidence in Ethereum’s utility and long-term value.

Title: NSE, Tata Capital, SBI AMC, Lenskart, Pine Labs, HDFC Securities: Are unlisted shares a trap or opportunity for investors?

Prices circulate like hot tips. “NSE trades near ₹2,000 in the unlisted market, up 80 per cent in a year,” says one post. Another forwards a pitch on Tata Capital, citing Tata Technologies’ 2023 debut, where the shares priced ₹500 in the IPO closed at ₹1,313 on debut. Such chatter highlights the new obsession: unlisted shares, or pre-IPO stocks. Sellers include employees monetising ESOPs, VC (venture capital)/PE (private equity) funds and AIF (alternative investment funds)/PMS (portfolio management services) strategies trimming stakes, promoters seeking liquidity, and brokers sourcing blocks. Buyers once limited to wealthy individuals, HNIs and insiders now include semi-mainstream investors, where unlisted stocks are pushing to become an integral part of the portfolio. The IPO euphoria adds fuel. In FY25, 78 main-board public issues raised a record ₹1.62 lakh crore, 2.5x the previous year, according to primedatabase. Yet, allotments remain elusive: 56 issues drew bids over 10x, with 33 of them above 50x. With such odds, many investors are turning to the invisible — unlisted market. The pitch is simple: buy early, ride the buzz and cash out at listing. And this is no small pool. As Motilal Oswal Financial Services Chairman Raamdeo Agarawal noted in the latest annual report, 1,300 unlisted firms earned ₹100 crore-plus profits in FY24, together raking in ₹7.5 lakh crore. At 20x multiple, this equals about ₹150 lakh crore of potential IPO market-cap. Still, for all the promise, the unlisted space is a grey zone. Markets are loosely regulated, prices swing wildly, liquidity can be shallow, information patchy and exits tricky. Yet the excitement around names such as SBI AMC, Lenskart, Acko, BOAT, Pine Labs, Rapido, HDFC Securities and Hero FinCorp shows why the buzz is growing louder every week. In other words, the market may be niche compared with India’s ₹450 lakh crore listed universe, but it is alive with promise, speculation and no shortage of risk. In 2022, a purportedly leaked audio of a furious founder berating a banker over missed IPO shares showed how emotions run high when allocations slip away. A quick scan of IPO forums, X posts or comments in Instagram reels shows retail investors echoing the same anger. Some blame IPO registrars, others mock the lottery system. With huge IPO oversubscriptions, the odds are stacked against small investors hoping to make a quick buck on listing pop. This frustration is pushing many to the unlisted space. The logic is simple: If the public issue is inaccessible, try to buy earlier in the private market, even at a premium. What was once a closed, opaque dealer-driven activity has broadened in recent years. Digital platforms and wealth managers now act as intermediaries, matching buyers and sellers. Firms such as WWIPL, Unlistedzone, InCredMoney, Stockify, Sharescart and Planify publish price quotes and updates that were earlier unavailable. Entry thresholds have also been lowered. Another driver is employee stock sales. Start-up staff often monetise ESOPs in unlisted markets, creating steady supply. On the demand side, investors view this as early access to future giants. India has over 110 unicorns worth over $350 billion as per studies. Some, like Flipkart and Physicswallah, already trade in the private market. But risks are evident: Several celebrated start-ups have faced valuation markdowns of 50-70 per cent in recent rounds. In 2024, BlackRock marked down its BYJU’s stake, once worth $22 billion, to zero! PharmEasy’s parent, API Holdings, has also seen valuations collapse from nearly $4 billion in 2021 to a fraction today. There is also the pull of exclusivity. Investors like owning what others cannot. Screenshots of holdings in buzzy companies circulate on WhatsApp groups as a badge of early access. With prices shooting up, early investors in unlisted firms become advertisers, boasting of paper gains. For instance, unlisted SBI AMC in the past two years delivered about 64 per cent CAGR, according to data from unlisted trading platform WWIPL. This compares to 52 per cent CAGR by listed peer HDFC AMC in the same period. Stories of celebrities making 50-100x on pre-IPO bets also catch eyeballs. Since such shares are scarce, artificial scarcity itself adds to premiums. It is true that the private market generates more return. For instance, Primex 40 is up 20 per cent in the last one year, 94 per cent in the last two years and 215 per cent in the last five years. These returns are much higher than Sensex across periods. The Primex 40 index tracks India’s top private firms, weighted by market cap; current top constituents include NSE, SBI AMC, Tata Capital, Capgemini Technology Services India, Nayara Energy, CIAL, GFCL EV, Hero Fincorp, HDFC Securities and Incred Holdings. But this early opportunity space carries risks just as significant. Unlike listed equities, no centralised exchange exists for price discovery. Quotes vary across dealers and platforms, with opaque spreads as intermediaries price differently. Some merely arrange transfers between large sellers and small buyers, leaving loyalties unclear. Prices of buzzy counters can swing within days, with spikes often fuelled purely by demand-supply dynamics than fundamentals. And when unlisted stocks go out of favour, liquidity drops to nil within days. Listed shares can be exited in seconds; unlisted ones can stay stuck for weeks. Even big names can face long dry spells after negative news; for smaller firms, illiquidity can be total. Exits can become even harder if a company delays its IPO (for example, OYO trying to go public since 2019) or faces valuation markdowns (Mobikwik’s IPO valuation was over 50 per cent lower than last funding valuation pre-IPO in 2021). Lately, IPOs such as HDB Financial, Vikram Solar and NSDL priced 15-40 per cent below unlisted market expectations, according to reports. The risk-return record of pre-IPO bets underscores the challenge. According to a Client Associates white paper, only nine out of 21 new-age companies that went public between May 2020 and June 2025 generated positive alpha over their pre-IPO price. For every Zomato, Policybazaar, Ixigo or Ather Energy that rewarded early buyers, there were disappointments such as Paytm, Ola Electric, FirstCry and Mobikwik. The distribution is highly polarised, some delivered exceptional gains, but many destroyed capital. Beyond pricing, liquidity, delays in listing, corporate governance and founder behaviour can also impact investors. Instances have been reported where some start-up founders create new entities, leaving old investors stuck and their value eroded. For investors in young companies, the risk is amplified. Even larger, older firms are not immune to shocks if management changes course or policy/regulations become unfavourable. Take Dream11, for instance. Its unlisted shares were available on some platforms, and earlier this year the Burgundy Private Hurun India 500 report ranked it the eighth most valuable unlisted company in India. But fortunes can turn fast. On August 21, 2025, the Parliament passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill within 72 hours of Cabinet clearance, banning real money games. The law will prohibit firms like Dream11 from accepting user deposits for games where players risk losing money. Information asymmetry is a major challenge. Listed firms provide quarterly disclosures, analyst calls and continuous updates. Unlisted companies, governed by the Companies Act, file audited accounts just once a year, often delayed. Public documents are few, and MCA21 access is cumbersome. MCA21 is the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ online portal for company information. It provides public access to filings, records and financials of even unlisted firms. But there’s no dependable way to gauge unlisted firms’ business momentum or financial health regularly. Ordinary investors may unknowingly fund exits for insiders with superior knowledge. With such limited disclosures, this asymmetry puts retail investors at a clear disadvantage.Rating agency actions are published at wide intervals, only if the firm is rated. There is also hardly any reliable analyst coverage in unlisted stocks, who can provide neutral opinion on valuation. Together, these factors i.e. uncertain pricing and listing timelines, poor liquidity,, governance risks, and patchy disclosures make unlisted shares a very high-risk space. Investors attracted by the potential upside must weigh these challenges carefully. SEBI Chairman Tuhin Kanta last week said that SEBI may pilot a regulated pre-IPO platform with required disclosures before listing. This may help address many of the pain-points. Till then, investors must take cognisance of the challenges. Yet while unlisted stocks are risky, for some the charm may be worth it as there are success stories also. Time and again, SEBI has cautioned investors against using unauthorised online platforms for trading unlisted public company securities. Hence those with skills to assess the risk-reward clearly, must stick to regulated brokers and platforms only. Earlier dealer-driven, trades now happen via brokers, digital platforms and wealth desks that publish quotes and basic data. In a typical flow (off-market DP to DP (depository participant) transfer), buyer receives an indicative two-way quote and confirms quantity and price. Note, quotes are non-binding and can change quickly. Buyer shares PAN, Aadhaar, Client Master List (CML) from their DP, a cancelled cheque and sometimes a DIS/e-DIS (electronic delivery instruction slip) consent. Address proof and selfie/video-KYC are common. Intermediary verifies ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), free holdings, pledge/lien status and whether the company’s Articles require ROFR (right of first refusal)/board consent. Some issuers may insist on pre-approval before transfer. Payment is usually NEFT/RTGS/IMPS to an escrow or mapped account (no cash). Many follow Delivery-vs-Payment (DVP) so that funds are released after demat credit. Others use T+1/T+3 settlement. Seller raises an off-market instruction with their DP (NSDL/CDSL). Buyer receives credit in the demat. In terms of timelines, same-day to T+3 is common. Delays could arise from KYC mismatches, bank cut-offs, DP holidays, or issuer approvals. Large counters need high minimums, though some intermediaries allow smaller tickets (₹50,000-1 lakh). In terms of capital gain taxes, short-term capital gains or STCG (≤24 months) is taxed at slab for unlisted shares and long-term capital gains or LTCG (>24 months) at 12.5 per cent without indexation. If sold post-listing, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) applies; >one year qualifies for equity LTCG. Pre-IPO shares carry a six-month lock-in. One of the major operational risks to watch is the lack of exchange arbitration. So, dispute redressal is weaker than in listed markets. Also, watch out for fraudsters and scamsters. Practical safeguards include using DVP/escrow system, if possible. Try to avoid pay-first arrangements unless you trust the intermediary. Insist on invoice/contract note and transfer proof. Verify ISIN, share class and any transfer restrictions before wiring funds. Keep all KYC and DP details exact; even minor mismatches can stall transfers. NSDL’s June 3 circular reportedly mandates prior written consent from unlisted companies for off-market share transfers. Consent must be signed by an authorised official and include transferor/transferee details, PANs, share class and compliance with Articles of Association and Companies Act. In this case, timelines could be much longer than T+3. Published on August 23, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Spot XRP ETF Coming Soon? Asset Managers Submit Amended S-1 Filings

According to the latest report, a group of asset management firms submitted S-1 amendments for a spot XRP ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States. These movements reflect the ramped-up interest of these institutions to get the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer this crypto-linked investment product. On Friday, August 22, a slew of asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, filed amended S-1 statements for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. According to experts, this round of filings might be in response to the US SEC’s feedback on their original applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X: Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from [the] SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected. Similarly, the ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, shared a similar sentiment, saying that it is very significant to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings at once and on the same day. “Very good sign IMO [in my opinion],” Geraci wrote on X. For a security or ETF to be listed on an exchange, it needs an S-1 filing, which provides a brief prospectus of the proposed security. Meanwhile, the S-1 form is amended as material information changes regarding the structure of the exchange-traded fund. Hence, it is no surprise to see some changes in the structure of proposed spot XRP ETFs. For instance, the amended S-1 filing appears to switch the exchange-traded products from simply cash creations and redemptions to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions. It is worth mentioning that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm and manager of the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, has still not made a move to join the race for the spot XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, the trillion-dollar asset manager revealed earlier in August that it has no intentions to launch an XRP fund. Following a torrid start to the week, the XRP token fell beneath the $3 mark to as low as $2.8 on Friday. However, the altcoin jumped back above $3 on the back of the news of the complete dismissal of Ripple’s lawsuit and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech. As of this writing, the XRP token is valued at around $3.01, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

But just because it's happened before doesn't mean it will happen again. One of the hottest debates raging right now across the crypto industry is whether or not Bitcoin will stick to its usual four-year cycle. Experts have been chiming in from both sides of the spectrum, and Crypto X is rife with hot takes (as ever). Last year, Bitcoin did something it hadn't done before when it hit a new high ahead of the halving, following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has led some analysts and observers to believe that Bitcoin's typical cycle—when the coin hits a high the year after its halving, only to plunge by 70-80% the following year—is finished. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 "It's just common sense," Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "More stable owners, more stable price," he added, referring to the ETF investors. The approval of ETFs in January 2024 allowed millions of dollars in capital previously locked out of the markets to flood into the space. Months after they started trading, the leading cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high. The coin has since broken new highs off the back of crypto-friendly President Donald Trump's victory, rising yet again to a fresh peak last week. Investors in the space are now more sophisticated, too: Institutions from Harvard University and Goldman Sachs have bought Bitcoin—and via the ETFs, no less. Such investors are less likely to panic-sell, and are buying to hold for the long term, Balchunas said. "I think the ETF kicked off this new phase, and I don't know if the four year cycle would apply. I don't want to say never, but again, you have to use common sense," he said. "Volatility is based on the people who hold it." Bitcoin was recently trading for $115,492 per coin, up more than 2% over the past day and by 22% year-to-date, according to CoinGecko. It broke a new record of $124,128 on August 14. In the previous bull run, Bitcoin peaked at a high of $69,044 in November 2021. But the hype didn’t last and a brutal correction occurred, leading Bitcoin to crash below $16,000 in November 2022 after a long list of crypto companies went bankrupt following the collapse of Terra—most notably the prominent digital asset exchange, FTX. Bitcoin is now much more mature, however, and further integrated into traditional markets, noted André Dragosch, Bitwise's Europe head of research. "Our thesis is that macro- and demand-related factors are definitely becoming increasingly more important due to Bitcoin's increasing integration into the global financial system," he said. Dragosch added that the performance effect from the halving—which occurs approximately every four years and slashes the BTC rewards earned by network-supporting miners—has been declining, while demand-related factors are becoming increasingly important. But not all experts agree. A report by CoinGlass this week used data to point out that this year is looking increasingly like previous cycles—especially in terms of price action. The report said that the flagship coin's price movements are echoing what was seen in the cycles of 2015-2018 and 2018–2022, and that capital inflows into the asset are "showing signs of fatigue." "Alongside this, long-term holders have realized profit levels comparable to past euphoric phases, reinforcing the impression of a market late in its cycle," the report read. But it's worth noting that every cycle, there are quirks—and HODLers will ultimately have to wait to see how things play out. "Every time that we think, 'This time it's different,' it seems that the market corrects us and shows us: 'Nope, this time it's exactly the same,'" Nick Hansen, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor, told Decrypt.

Title: BlackRock Triggers Bitcoin Sell-Offs With Half A Billion Dollars Dumped

The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has notably been on a Bitcoin selling spree throughout this week, triggering a wave of sell-offs in the process. These sales have occurred due to the outflows that the asset manager has witnessed from its BTC ETF. Arkham data shows that BlackRock has offloaded around $500 million in Bitcoin this week, with transfers to Coinbase, a move that indicates a move to sell these coins. The asset manager has sold these coins following outflows from its iShares Bitcoin ETF, which was the norm throughout this week. SoSo Value data shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF first recorded a daily net outflow of $68.72 million on August 18. The fund then further saw net outflows of $220 million, $127.49 million, and $198.81 million on August 20, 21, and 22, respectively. Notably, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has accounted for most of the outflows, with the BTC ETFs as a group currently on a six-day streak of consecutive net outflows. These Bitcoin ETFs have seen total net outflows of almost $1.2 billion since August 15. Meanwhile, in just this week alone, over $1.1 billion has left these funds, sparking a bearish sentiment for the BTC price. Given BlackRock’s position as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, outflows from its fund had sparked a wave of sell-offs. This led to a massive decline for the flagship crypto earlier in the week. The Bitcoin price had dropped to as low as $112,000 this week as BlackRock and other BTC investors took profit on their investments. This followed the flagship crypto’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 last week. However, BTC has now sharply rebounded on the back of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, in which he indicated that a rate cut might happen in September. Notably, Powell’s speech was enough to spark fresh inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs on August 22, with BlackRock the only fund manager that recorded a net outflow on the day. Further data from SoSo Value shows that Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest recorded a daily inflow of $65.47 million, the most among the issuers on the day. Meanwhile, Fidelity, Van Eck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale recorded inflows of $50.88 million, $26.41 million, $13.51 million, $12.70 million, and $6.42 million, respectively. However, BlackRock recorded an outflow of $198.81 million, which led to a daily net outflow of $23.15 million for the funds as a group. With the Bitcoin price rebounding, these funds, including BlackRock’s IBIT, could return to witnessing significant daily inflows from next week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $115,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Market momentum remains strong as ETH approaches its 2021 peak. Ethereum is nearing its all-time high despite mixed signals from institutions. Market momentum and bullish sentiment suggests potential for further gains. Ethereum [ETH] hits fresh highs even as institutional money appeared to be heading for the exit. Outflows from spot ETH ETFs have been heavy, yet big names like keep buying. There’s a striking divergence in sentiment: while some institutions are cashing out, other heavyweight players seem intent on staying. Ethereum traded at $4,737 at press time, just shy of its all-time high of $4,891 set back in November 2021 according to CoinMarketCap. The hourly chart highlighted an upward move (with Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speech being a key catalyst) followed by consolidation, so bulls were defending the higher levels. The RSI was at 62.8, indicating strong momentum but leaving some room before hitting overbought territory. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD showed waning bullish momentum as the histogram turned red. If buying pressure persists, ETH could attempt another run at its historic peak, though short-term corrections remain likely given the recent volatility. ETH is chasing new highs, but there’s more to it than what meets the eye. Source: Glassnode On one hand, U.S. spot ETFs have been under pressure, with Ethereum ETFs recording a staggering 111k ETH in outflows. Yet, not all major players are retreating. BlackRock recently purchased $233 million worth of ETH, showing long-term conviction in the asset. Source: Arkham Intelligence Adding to the bullish narrative, Trump’s World Liberty fund also made a notable acquisition, spending $5.025 million USDC for 1,076 ETH at $4,670. Source: X Amid the mixed institutional flows, one of crypto’s most influential voices remains firmly bullish on Ethereum. Since first declaring “$ETH = $5,000” back in December 2023, Arthur Hayes has actively swing-traded ETH through his public wallet, often selling only to buy back at higher prices as the token continued its ascent. Source: X Now, the Maelstrom CIO has reaffirmed his conviction, forecasting a monumental rally. In a recent Crypto Banter interview, Hayes argued that, “the chart says it’s going higher, you can’t fight the market.” He predicted that Ethereum could surge to $10,000-$20,000 before the end of this cycle.

Title: 18 months after becoming the first human implanted with Elon Musk’s brain chip, Neuralink ‘Participant 1’ Noland Arbaugh says his whole life has changed
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/23/neuralink-participant-1-noland-arbaugh-18-months-post-surgery-life-changed-elon-musk/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. It was February 2024 when Noland Arbaugh, the first person to get Elon Musk’s experimental brain chip, rolled across the stage in a wheelchair during a Neuralink “all hands” meeting, revealing his identity for the first time. The room, filled with Neuralink employees, erupted in applause as Arbaugh—who dislocated two of his vertebrae in a swimming accident in 2016 and has since lost sensation and movement below his shoulders—smiled ear-to-ear in his chair, a red Texas A&M hat planted on his head. He grinned as he began to speak: “Hello, humans.” About a month before that town hall, Arbaugh had undergone surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, about 2.5 hours from his home in Yuma, to get an experimental chip embedded into his brain which Neuralink had been working on and testing on animals for the past nine years. Arbaugh was anesthetized and, in a surgery that lasted just under two hours, a Neuralink-made robotic surgery device implanted the chip and connected tiny threads with more than 1,000 electrodes to the neurons in his brain. Now the device can measure electrical activity, process signals, then translate those signals into commands to a digital device. In layman’s speak, the BCI , or brain-computer interface, allows Arbaugh to control a computer with his mind. As a result, Arbaugh can do things like play Mario Kart, control his television, and turn his Dyson air purifier on and off without physically moving his fingers or any other part of his body. The first day that Arbaugh used his device, he beat the 2017 world record for speed and precision in BCI cursor control. “It was very, very easy to learn how to use,” he tells me in an interview. When Arbaugh became Participant 1—or “P1” as he is often referred to by Neuralink employees and subsequent study participants—he joined a list of about 80 people to ever receive such a device. Brain chip interfaces have been a focus of neurological study for more than 50 years, and there’s a dozen companies in the U.S. and China that have been conducting limited human trials since 1998. But becoming the first patient to get a Neuralink implant, in particular, is its own right of passage. For one, Neuralink’s device has threads with more than 1,000 electrodes, giving the device a much higher connectivity rate than most of the BCIs currently being studied in humans in the market. But Neuralink also places its electrodes in the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement—a more invasive approach than competitors like Synchron or Precision Neuroscience, which also have ongoing studies of multiple patients. Neuralink’s device is also wireless, versus competitors like Blackrock Neurotech that require a wired connection from the implant through the skull to an external receiver for signal capture and decoding (BlackRock Neurotech sells a wireless processor that has been used for research). That means Neuralink participants can go cordless—but the device is battery powered because of it and does need to be charged: around every five hours or so, Arbaugh says. Neuralink heat treats the charger, a coil, into some of Arbaugh’s hats, so that he can recharge it while wearing a hat. In the beginning, Arbaugh couldn’t use the device while it charged, though that’s since been updated. Of course, there is also the fact that Neuralink is Elon Musk’s brain chip company, which draws an entirely different level of scrutiny and attention to any study participant. Since Arbaugh revealed himself as “P1,” he has become a public figure, frequently invited on podcasts and having journalists show up at his home. His X account has been hacked, and he told me that a SWAT team showed up with AR15s after someone gave a false tip to the local sheriff’s office that Arbaugh was in danger. When I first reached out to Arbaugh in early June to see how the BCI had changed his day-to-day 1.5 years in, it took a couple months for us to finally pin down a time. When we finally did hop on the phone, he laughed. “I’m just so busy all the time,” he says. “That is so different than what life was like before… I feel like I’m playing catch-up for eight years of not doing anything—kind of lying around, staring at walls.” Since Arbaugh became the first Neuralink patient in January 2024, there have been eight more individuals, including one woman, to enroll in the company’s ongoing clinical trials, which are now open in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. So far, all of the surgeries have taken place at hospitals in the U.S., with two of the participants receiving the implant on the same day at the end of July. All of the study participants suffer from either paralysis or ALS, a nervous system disease that causes loss of muscle control. “Our goal is to really build a whole brain interface,” Neuralink cofounder and president DJ Seo, said during Neuralink’s summer update meeting. For Arbaugh, the Neuralink device has been entirely transformative, he says. He uses it about 10 hours a day to control his computer so he can study, read, and game—and to handle things like scheduling an interview with me. Arbaugh enrolled in classes at his community college in Arizona, where he has started taking prerequisites he needs for a degree in neuroscience, and, as he tells Fortune, he’s working on starting his own business—paid professional speaking engagements and live talks. As he talks about all of it with me, his excitement—and a newfound sense of purpose—is palpable. Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose… I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the last year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a “BCI,” or Neuralink for that matter—until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied, and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later, he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his check-ups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that, with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity for the first time) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine’, but I still see myself as a regular guy Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink’s first study participant As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of non-disclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called “Blindsight,” that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more-invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours have led to high turnover as a result. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it’s used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke also contested the claim of animal mistreatment). While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin Gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot of his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a “cyborg”—the scifi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy… But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose… I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the last year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a “BCI,” or Neuralink for that matter—until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied, and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later, he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his check-ups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that, with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity for the first time) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine’, but I still see myself as a regular guy Noland Arbaugh, Neuralink’s first study participant As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of non-disclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called “Blindsight,” that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more-invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours have led to high turnover as a result. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it’s used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke also contested the claim of animal mistreatment). While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin Gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot of his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a “cyborg”—the scifi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy… But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says.

Title: Whales scramble to grab ONDO under $1 as tokenization booms 7000%

Tokenization grew 7000% with ONDO leading the charge, but its price is stalling. U.S. Treasuries surged 7,000% since 2023, led by ONDO’s growth this year. But despite support at $0.90, reversal patterns hint at possible downside. Ondo Finance [ONDO] has been down by 2% on the day, but still leading other Real World Assets (RWA) coins. The altcoin was not left out in the recent decline across the broader market that has extended to stocks. Tokenization of RWAs has recently grown exponentially since the start of Trump’s second term. Momentum grew after the White House Bitcoin report mentioned ONDO, positioning the altcoin as a leader in this space. Per a post by Dami Defi on X, U.S. treasuries tokenized on blockchain had grown by about 7000% in only two years. The category was led by BlackRock, followed by ONDO, which surged by 120% since the start of 2025. Ethereum [ETH], Chainlink LINK], and Solana [SOL] were the leading layers for tokenizing. Messari highlighted that ONDO had grown to over $1.3 billion AUM, which was about 33% of all tokenized assets. Source: Token Terminal Its stablecoins issued on Solana blockchain grew to $250 million, accounting for about 64%. This showed ONDO was dominating deployment of RWAs which was expected to hit $30 trillion by 2034, as per Standard Chartered. Onchain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that a whale was busy accumulating the altcoin under $1 valuation. Their wallet longed about 1.35 million ONDO equivalent to $1.26 million at the time of writing. This came as the leadership expanded minting of stocks to CoWSwap, as per data from EtherScan. They actively tested by deploying American Express on ONDO using CoWSwap. Source: EtherScan The expansion aligned with ONDO’s goal of easing tokenization while ensuring there was enough reach. That way, more protocols onboarded, and user growth could follow since they directly correlate. Despite this huge milestone in terms of tokenizing and chain activity, ONDO price was stalling. Its price had formed two bearish reversal patterns, suggesting more downside potential was due. Initial pattern led to a price drop from $1.15 to $0.85. The second has seen ONDO drop from $1.10 to $0.90, where it set up a floor. Still, the ability of $0.90, holding was dependent on wider market reaction, especially for Bitcoin [BTC]. With the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at 0.17 and in an uptrend, it signaled capital inflow. This supported the aforementioned capital inflow from the whale’s wallet. Source: TradingView The heads and shoulders pattern hinted at further drops. Therefore, revisiting $0.85 could not be ruled out. However, the anticipation was for the zone to hold for a rebound. Failure could invalidate a potential reversal. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Glamorous Waterford Crystal lighting for your home

Collecting antiques is one of the best ways to pay homage to the craftsmanship of bygone eras. Although trends come and go, experts say that quality pieces will always hold their value in the long term. With this in mind, it’s interesting to see Waterford Crystal chandeliers in Keighery’s next online auction in Waterford city on Monday, August 25th. Crystal may no longer be as fashionable, but it was once a symbol of prestige and glamour. Waterford Crystal was known not only for its homeware collections of glasses, bowls, vases and, yes, even chandeliers, but the Irish-made crystal was also used in trophies for sporting competitions. Irish people have great pride in the history of the brand, which dates from the 1780s. While production ceased in the late 19th century, it was then reintroduced after the second World War. The revival, by two Czechs, Karel (Charles) Bacik and Miroslav Havel, was a fascinating chapter of Waterford Crystal, as Havel drew on old pattern books of the original Waterford flint glass works stored in the National Museum to create new designs. Waterford Crystal chandeliers were hung in Westminster Abbey for its 900th anniversary in 1966, and later, Waterford Crystal chandeliers graced the halls of Windsor Castle and the Kennedy Centre in Washington, DC. More than a billion people watched a huge Waterford Crystal ball as part of the countdown at the millennium ball on New Year’s Eve in Times Square, New York, in 1999. Sadly, Waterford Wedgwood, as it became, went into receivership in 2009, and was later acquired by the Finnish group Fiskars. Most Waterford Crystal is no longer made in Ireland. The Keighery’s auction has 16 lots of Waterford Crystal lighting in total. This includes three nine-branch chandeliers (€2,000-€3,000 each); eight five-branch chandeliers (€1,000-€1,500 each); and three Brenda ceiling lights (€500-800 each). There is also two lots of wall lights. All the chandeliers at Keighery’s auction date from the 1960s and 1970s, with the original Waterford acid stamp. Auctions specialising in tableware, furniture and eclectic design pieces offer homeowners an opportunity to refresh the style of their interiors with new additions. Adam’s At Home online auction on Wednesday, August 27th, is a case in point. It has a wide selection of silver – both functional and ornamental – as well as plenty of antique cutlery sets of forks, spoons, platters and other tableware. The curators of the Adam’s auction suggest the pairing of antique plates and dishes with silverware, perhaps prompting a new design trend for dinner party table design as the autumn evenings beckon. Adding striking pieces to a table – whether that’s an ornately patterned serving dish, a silver saucière (sauce or gravy boat) or colourful antique glasses – can spark unexpected conversations over a meal. A tea and coffee service with a coffee pot, teapot, cream jug and sugar bowl (€1,500-€2,500) by Irish silversmith and jewellery designer Michael Hilliar and eight 18th-century octagonal blue-and-white Chinese porcelain dishes (€150-€300) are among the items that caught our attention. The 19th-century oval satinwood and burr walnut breakfast table (€800-€1,000) and the pair of brass mounted stained oak bedside tables (€400-€600), are also practical sizes for contemporary homes. Among the rugs for sale is a Middle Eastern wool rug, with a large standing lion (€500-€1,000). This would work either as a wall hanging or on the floor in a period or contemporary living space. The latter was purchased from the late Swedish-born antiques carpet expert Per Lindfors, who ran the Peter Linden Gallery in Blackrock from 1979 to 2006, and later advised private clients worldwide on antique carpets and rugs until his death in 2024. Viewing for the Adam’s At Home auction starts on Saturday, August 23rd, and continues until Tuesday, August 26th, in Adam’s St Stephen’s Green showrooms. Hegarty Antiques in Bandon, County Cork is also hosting a live online auction from 11am on Tuesday, August 26th. Among the wide range of silverware for sale are two unusual pieces that might work perfectly as unique gifts. The first is a pair of Chinese silver filigree enamel bird figurines (€150-€300). These intricate pieces, made in the early 1900s, have filigree silver inset with multicoloured enamel to feathers, beak and eyes. The second piece is a late 19th-century Russian dome-shaped egg casket with a standing lion inside (€200-€400). Finally, a bit of advance notice for fans of regional antiques fairs. Limerick Racecourse is the venue for a large antiques and vintage fair on Saturday and Sunday, September 6th and 7th, 11am-6pm. With 60 dealers selling everything from small pieces of antique furniture and decorative pieces to silverware, jewellery, militaria and coins, it promises to be a feast for the eyes and a temptation for the pocket. antiquesireland.ie adams.ie hegartyantiques.com Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Mullen’s Hammer price €1,050 Auction house Mullen’s Estimate €1,000-€1,500 Hammer price €2,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €700-€1,000 Hammer price €1,600 Auction house Adam’s © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Great Crypto Divide: Why Wall Street’s old guard still won’t touch crypto

Franklin Templeton's Max Gokhman says traditional fund managers just don't want to add crypto, but education and yield might change it quickly. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin and crypto seem to be on the verge of mainstream adoption, with US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) shattering inflow records, Goldman Sachs holding more crypto ETF shares issued by BlackRock than any other institution, and corporate treasuries from Strategy to Bitmine embracing digital assets. However, a recent survey from Bank of America showed three-quarters of global fund managers remain steadfast in their refusal to touch digital assets. According to Max Gokhman, deputy chief investment officer for Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, the paradoxical numbers aren’t due to regulatory uncertainty or operational complexity, as those barriers have largely been addressed. In an interview with CryptoSlate, Gokhman said the skewed numbers stem from fear, misconception, and the industry’s struggle with abandoning deeply held beliefs about what constitutes legitimate investment. Gokhman spent years watching traditional finance grapple with the digital asset revolution. He noted: “The biggest reason is it takes a while for an established industry to realize that they’re falling behind. There’s this fear of the unknown that exists.” Fund managers pride themselves on fiduciary responsibility, but this protective instinct has created a paradox: the desire to safeguard client assets prevents managers from accessing opportunities their clients increasingly demand. According to Gokhman: “Part of being a good steward is being aware of what your clients want. Clients from retail to institutional level are more interested in digital assets, but they’re finding that their investment managers are not actually there with solutions.” The resistance stems from persistent misconceptions. One notion is that it’s all hyper-speculative and lacks value, while the other is that there is a lack of staff with the expertise to create legitimate investment solutions using digital assets. When Gokhman encounters skeptical colleagues, the conversation follows a predictable script. Traditional finance stalwarts mention memecoins as representative of the entire crypto ecosystem, revealing what he called a surface-level understanding. Just as equity markets span from blue-chip dividends to speculative biotechs, digital assets range from established protocols generating real revenue to purely speculative tokens. His response has become automatic: “Because you invest in equities, does that mean you’re only buying pink sheet penny stocks? High-yield debt has plenty of companies that most rational investors wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole. Most asset managers will tell you they own emerging market equities and distressed debt. That’s a key asset class for them.” Gokhman stressed that the skepticism is selective. Managers are comfortable holding Venezuelan bonds, instruments that have defaulted multiple times, while balking at Bitcoin, which has never missed a payment in 15 years. While fund managers debate crypto’s legitimacy, the market has quietly transformed. The data Gokhman cited punctures the retail narrative: 89% of Bitcoin transactions on exchanges exceed $100,000. He highlighted: “That’s not retail money. The market is becoming more institutionalized.” Franklin Templeton’s response involves a three-tier campaign targeting central bankers, institutional intermediaries, and retail investors. The middle tier, which is crucial, consists of wirehouses and platform owners who control access to millions yet remain ignorant of client demand. Gokhman questions these players about whether they asked their clients if they wanted crypto. He adds: “They may have a Coinbase account where they have most of their wealth. You’re just not capturing that.” Traditional advisors often discover wealth sits fragmented across platforms, with professionally managed portfolios containing none of the digital assets clients accumulate independently. Franklin Templeton’s breakthrough lies in translation: expressing blockchain concepts in traditional finance language. When analyzing Solana, they don’t invoke revolutionary rhetoric but calculate discounted cash flows. Gokhman explained: “If you have something like Solana where actual fees are being paid on every transaction, we can project the growth of those transactions. Those are future cash flows. We can discount them back to the present.” The approach demystifies digital assets by applying familiar analytical frameworks that any investor with basic valuation training can understand. As Federal Reserve rate cuts approach, Gokhman sees opportunity. Traditional yield sources offer diminishing returns just as institutions face mounting pressure to generate income, and crypto can provide an alternative. According to him: “Everyone needs income. Staking is one clear way to do it. When people tell me about being worried about this [crypto] all being a scam, well, have you worried about the government just canceling all the debt? Because I’ve had that happen.” Recent SEC guidance on liquid staking represents a potential inflection point. For the first time, regulated products can offer staking yields without requiring direct crypto ownership. If crypto ETFs with staking enabled are approved, Gokhman predicts the resistance cannot persist indefinitely. He predicted: “When we can give the yield, I think it’s going to drive even more adoption.” The transformation will likely accelerate suddenly. Institutional adoption often follows the pattern of persisting skepticism until competitive pressure forces mass movement. The great crypto divide persists between the 75% of fund managers clinging to familiar frameworks and a growing coalition recognizing that client service requires embracing technological change. The question isn’t whether this divide will close, as economic pressure guarantees eventual adoption. The question is which managers will lead and which will scramble to catch up.

Title: Trump Says Intel Will Give 10% Stake To U.S., Becoming Third-Largest Shareholder

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump on Friday said Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the U.S. the beleaguered chipmaker’s third-largest shareholder in one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade. Trump said the agreement, representing a 10% stake work roughly $10 billion, resulted from his meeting with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan last week, telling reporters Friday, “I said, ‘I think it would be good having the United States as your partner.’” The deal will likely require approval from Intel’s board of directors. A 10% stake would represent the third-largest institutional holding in Intel, behind 13% stakes held by Blackrock and Vanguard. An agreement—expected to be formally announced later Friday—would boost Intel, which has been “left behind” its competitors in the chipmaking industry, Trump said. Shares of Intel rose more than 6% to just below $24 after Trump announced the agreement. Earlier this month, Trump called Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and said he should resign “immediately,” after Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Intel’s board over his alleged ties to Chinese firms. Cotton asked whether Tan divested from Chinese companies linked to the Chinese military or Communist Party, and whether Intel’s board was aware of a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan served as CEO before being hired at Intel in March. Tan disputed the claims in a memo to Intel employees, writing there was “a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles” and arguing he has “always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.” Trump’s opinion on Tan changed after meeting in the White House last week, when Trump lauded Tan as “an amazing story.” A 10% stake would rank the U.S. just above SoftBank, which announced earlier this week it would invest $2 billion in Intel as part of both firms “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S. The investment represents a roughly 2% stake, ranking SoftBank the fifth-largest shareholder of Intel. An investment by the U.S. in Intel developed over the last week, as Trump administration officials reportedly discussed converting grants under the CHIPS Act into an equity stake. Such a partial ownership in a U.S.-based company is historically rare, though the federal government previously injected billions of funds into Chrysler and General Motors to help restore the auto industry after the 2008 financial crisis. In the early 20th century, the U.S. provided financial support through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which was created by President Franklin Roosevelt to stabilize struggling banks, railroads and other firms during the Great Depression. The Treasury Department also provided loans through the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the U.S. took up rights to buy stock in airlines like Delta, United and Southwest.

Title: One in three Bitcoin treasuries slip below value as ‘spiral of doom’ fears grow

About us Copy link Bitcoin treasury companies are in trouble. Their idea was simple: buy Bitcoin, package it in a corporate wrapper, and watch traders pay a premium for the shares. Then issue more stock. Rinse and repeat. On paper, it’s a perpetual money printer. The problem? One in three of the 156 publicly listed crypto treasury firms tracked by Capriole Investments now trade below a market net asset value, or mNAV, multiple of one. That means investors value these businesses for less than what their Bitcoin’s worth. Others put that figure at one in seven. And the gap is expected to widen. “There are structural reasons that suggest we may continue to see mNAVs dropping for some treasury companies,” Carlos Guzmán, VP of research at GSR, told DL News. That could force many companies to indiscriminately sell Bitcoin to pay the debt used to buy it. In turn, that could create a negative feedback loop of selling pressure that drags down share and crypto prices, Coinbase warned in a June report, suggesting that crypto treasury companies posed systemic risks. Most treasury firms can’t maintain the aggressive accumulation needed to justify a premium, Bitcoin analyst James Check argued in a June newsletter. As mNAVs inevitably drift towards one, the window to issue shares at a premium — and convert the proceeds into more Bitcoin — shrinks. Add operating costs, dilution, inconsistent buys, and investor fatigue toward strategies that aren’t all-in on buying Bitcoin, and underperformance becomes more likely, Check said. The whole pitch of a Bitcoin treasury is to do what Strategy did: turn a stash of coins into a stock that trades at a premium. That still holds true for Strategy, which commands a 34% premium to its more than $71 billion Bitcoin hoard, due to its years-long effort to build credibility with shareholders and scale the idea into one of crypto’s hottest trends. Yet, many firms are failing to copy the strategy. The sector’s average mNAV has been declining since May, Blockworks data shows. Despite the bull market, the list of sub-one mNAV companies is growing — a sign investors are getting pickier about which firms deserve a premium. NAV cuts both ways: if demand for a company’s shares falls, the price can drop below the value of the assets it holds, creating a discount. Crypto firms are no strangers to this. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust once traded at a 50% discount. Even after it converted into a spot exchange-traded fund, which narrowed the gap, billions flowed to cheaper rivals provided by BlackRock and Fidelity. A sub-one mNAV doesn’t automatically mean undervalued. Bulls see opportunity, while bears see justified scepticism and risk. But the days when any corporate Bitcoin wallet could command a premium may be over. Indeed, share prices have been struggling despite Bitcoin’s rally, suggesting they’ve decoupled from the underlying assets. Strategy is down 20% over the past month. Jack Mallers’ Twenty One Capital has shed 16% and Metaplanet has dropped 33% over the past 30 days. Other players, like Semler Scientific, have lost more than half their share price value from their late December peak. Even KULR Technology — an early adopter compared to the 2025 rush — has seen its shares plummet as much as 87%. None of those firms responded to requests for comment. This shouldn’t be happening. Bitcoin’s August all-time high above $124,000 should’ve lifted these stocks in theory. One reason behind the dip is that most newcomers lack Strategy Chair Michael Saylor’s leverage, investor base, and track record, said Check. For them, a sub-one mNAV means increased debt loads, dilution risk, and credibility issues that are dragging valuations lower. That’s a problem as many of Bitcoin treasuries have little beyond their crypto stash, according to legendary short-seller Jim Chanos. Some have even abandoned their core businesses to go all-in on crypto. The market may also lack confidence in unproven leadership, Guzmán said. Newer digital asset firms may also struggle to maintain investor interest. “Attention tends to focus on a limited number of high-quality, successful teams,” Guzmán added. “That makes it harder for the long tail of digital asset treasuries to trade at a premium, and may cause them to slide into discount territory in bearish market conditions.” The mix of weak management, dilution risk, and limited brand recognition could spell disaster. Take Strategy. On Monday, the company changed its dilution rules, prompting former Goldman Sachs analyst Dom Kwok to warn of a “spiral of doom.” If the firm is forced to sell shares at thinner premiums just to stay afloat, shareholder value gets eroded, interest costs mount, and Strategy could be forced to offload Bitcoin to cover its obligations, said Kwok. Strategy did not reply to a request for comment from DL News. Still, not everyone thinks a market-wide collapse is inevitable. André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise, told DL News that the dangers are overblown. “The risks are relatively limited,” he said. He added that some Strategy copycats might struggle because of their higher cost basis, lack a proper understanding of the asset, execution, and communication strategy. Even so, Dragosch said leveraged purchases act as a flywheel that amplifies both upside and downside volatility. He believes most mNAV discounts are due to Bitcoin’s price action, not fundamental problems. “I personally don’t think that we will see an increasing number of mNAV discounts over the medium to long term,” he said. Still, the appetite for accumulation hasn’t vanished. “It’s clear the market is keen to have crypto treasury companies accumulate more assets,” Spencer Yang, managing partner at BlockSpaceForce, told DL News. “But I’d love to see these companies add even more value to the crypto ecosystem beyond asset accumulation.” Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

FOX Business' Gerri Willis has the details on the investment strategy on 'Varney & Co.' Nearly $4 billion of new money flowed into digital assets last week, with the U.S. dominating 99% of the total haul. Investors are taking a cue from President Trump’s push to open retirement accounts up to alternative assets. "My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement," a portion of a Trump executive order, "Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors," signed in early August, said. Ethereum illustration (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images / Getty Images) Ethereum ETPs (exchange-traded products), which give investors exposure to the crypto without holding it, attracted $2.87 billion in new assets last week, bringing the year-to-date inflows to a record $11 billion, as tracked by CoinShares. TRUMP'S 401(k) EXPANSION: WHAT TO KNOW Ethereum got an extra boost Friday, nearing the $4,800 level after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled a possible interest rate cut as early as September. It last hit a record $4,865.81 in November 2021. Ethereum commemorative coins and the interface of ethereum stocks displayed on a smartphone (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images / Getty Images) BlackRock's ETF arm, iShares, dominated the action, led by inflows into the Ethereum Trust ETF and its Bitcoin Trust ETF. BlackRock offices in New York City (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images / Getty Images) Bitcoin, which is taking a backseat to ethereum, saw a $552 million boost, reversing two straight weeks of outflows. The largest cryptocurrency by market value is hovering around the $116,000 level, up 20% year-to-date but down from its record high of $124,495.51 reached on Aug. 14. WINKELVOSS TWINS DROP MILLIONS OF BITCOIN IN PRO-TRUMP PAC Smaller cryptos, including Solana and XRP, saw inflows of $176.5 million and $125 million, respectively.

Title: Bitcoin Whales Quietly Stack 16,000 BTC During Downtrend

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Reports from CryptoQuant suggest that large holders are moving aggressively while smaller players are bailing out. Over the past week, wallets linked to key Bitcoin participants grabbed more than 16,000 BTC during a price decline. At the same time, retail investors have been selling into weakness, taking losses and widening the gap between whales and small traders. Analysts see this as a possible clue that the market could be forming a local bottom. The timing of these moves adds more complexity. September is rarely kind to markets. Data over the last 35 years shows the S&P 500 slipping an average of 1% during this month, and Bitcoin has often mirrored that seasonal drag. Now, throw in a Federal Reserve meeting on September 15-16, where traders assign an 80% chance to a 0.25% rate cut, and you have a cocktail of uncertainty. For some, a cut signals potential relief for risk assets. For others, the historic pattern overshadows any short-term optimism. Either way, volatility seems unavoidable. Amid this macro backdrop, a single transaction set off alarms. BlackRock shifted over 10,584 BTC—valued close to $1.20 billion—to Coinbase in one day. That kind of move rarely goes unnoticed. Transfers to exchanges often imply a readiness to sell, and the market responded immediately. Bitcoin slid to a little over $112,000, a level that previously acted as the launchpad for the rally that pushed prices to the all-time high of $124,000 this August. Traders are now watching that number like hawks, questioning if it can act as a safety net once more. Technical signals, however, don’t tell a unified story. The relative strength index sits at 32.90, scraping the oversold zone, which can sometimes hint at an exhausted sell-off. But the MACD is still weak, with its line staying under the signal mark, suggesting negative momentum. This split in indicators keeps traders guessing whether the next big move will be up or down. If $112,000 holds, a rebound is on the table. Break it, and the downside could accelerate, especially if institutions start unloading more Bitcoin. Add whale accumulation, seasonal weakness, and a looming Fed decision, and the short-term outlook looks less like a straight line and more like a curve with surprises waiting around the bend. For now, the battle is clear. It’s between confidence and fear, and the outcome may depend on what happens before this month closes.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Tokenized stock trading: The huge risks in moving stocks to blockchain
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/22/tokenized-stock-trading-the-huge-risks-in-moving-stocks-to-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T14:00:06Z

By James Royal, Ph.D., Bankrate.com The cryptocurrency industry has lately begun to heavily promote tokenized stocks, but what exactly are they? More importantly, what advantages do tokenized stocks offer — especially when investors already have safe, no-cost fractional share trading at many brokers? A tokenized stock is a fancy way of saying that ownership of a stock can be transferred via blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency. Tokenizing, or digitizing, assets such as stocks, ETFs and other securities allows them to be traded on a specialized digital exchange and potentially directly between investors without the need for an exchange. These tokens are held in a digital wallet, much as crypto coins are, similar to a traditional brokerage account. “The news cycle for crypto is all about representing traditional financial assets on a blockchain,” says Hilary Allen, professor, American University Washington College of Law. But Allen points out that investors and financial markets will endure major costs for doing so: “There are a lot of protections that are given up by this move.” In order to establish a tokenized stock, these steps are needed: — Taking custody of the asset: The asset that will be tokenized needs to be held in custody by a custodian, whose job is to safeguard it on behalf of the token creator. — Creating the token: A financial institution such as an investment bank or fintech company then creates the digitized token, which corresponds to the asset in custody. — Setting up smart contracts: Each token is programmed with self-executing smart contracts that give the token’s owner the same rights as stock ownership, including dividend distributions and voting rights, among others. Once the stock is tokenized, traders can exchange it among themselves on crypto platforms, other decentralized finance platforms or even potentially a traditional stock brokerage. For example, crypto exchange Kraken has created tokenized stocks that it calls xStocks, and now allows trading in 60 major stocks. Meanwhile, brokerage Robinhood launched token trading in the European Union in June, offering access to more than 200 U.S. stock and ETF tokens. Asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already offer tokenized money market funds. Goldman Sachs and BNY are teaming up to launch their own tokenized money market funds, too. More firms are exploring the idea of tokenized stocks. In short, you could think of a tokenized stock as one that trades via blockchain. So what’s the big deal for individual investors? The cryptocurrency industry is breathlessly hyping this as a huge leap forward – as it has done for crypto coins – but the benefits are modest for individual investors, especially buy-and-hold types, and the risks of tokenized stocks are high. In fact, the best stock brokers already offer many of these same benefits to investors at no cost. The crypto industry touts the following benefits of tokenized stock trading, many of which are already features at top brokers or may soon be features. — Increased accessibility through fractional shares: Tokenized stocks let investors trade portions of a share, meaning that high-priced stocks are accessible to even those with a little money. — Lower cost: The crypto industry touts the potentially lower cost of transactions by eliminating intermediaries via blockchain. — Transparency: The industry says thatby recording ownership on the blockchain, tokenization ensures that ownership is established. — Security: Proponents say that blockchain-enabled trading also increases security because ownership is irrevocably established on the blockchain. — 24/7 trading: Because tokenized stocks are held on a blockchain, they can be traded at any hour. — Immediate settling of trades: Proponents also point to the immediate settling of trades via tokenized stocks, in contrast to next-day settlement in the U.S. — More direct access between investors and firms: Tokenization may bypass existing financial intermediaries, letting companies raise money more directly from investors. Others note the serious risks in tokenizing stocks, particularly in the area of investor protection. — Potentially irrevocable transactions: Like cryptocurrency transactions, a tokenized stock transaction may be irrevocable. Once it’s done, it’s done, and it may be all but impossible to undo. — Uncertain legal protections: The legal treatment of tokenized stocks is way behind where the crypto industry is trying to go, exposing investors to plenty of risks. For example, who is considered the issuer of a tokenized stock: the firm that tokenized it or the stock’s original issuer? What happens if an asset is hacked? — Inflexible smart contracts: Smart contracts programmed into tokenized stocks will not cover all circumstances, says Allen. “It’s not clear how they’ll operate in unexpected environments.” — Circumventing investor protections: Private investments are private partially to protect investors, not merely to limit investments to the well-heeled, but tokenizing stocks can allow financial players to get around the rules. “It’s absolutely built as an end run around securities laws,” says Allen. “Crypto is built as an end run around securities laws.” — Loss of trust in American financial markets: One of the potential long-term effects of not enforcing existing securities laws is the erosion of trust in American capital markets. If securities laws aren’t enforced or are enforced inconsistently, then markets simply become a place to rip off investors. Bankrate reached out to Kraken and Robinhood for further comment but has not heard back. The crypto industry and some traditional financial institutions have talked a big game about tokenization of stocks and some players have moved toward tokenization. But what’s in it for individual investors? Many of tokenization’s supposed benefits touted by the crypto industry are already available for individual investors in the current system. — Fractional shares already exist: Individual investors can already access fractional shares — on thousands of stocks and ETFs — at the best brokers for fractional shares. — Stock trading is already commission-free: For individual investors, trading stocks is already free at every major online broker, so there’s no added benefit to using tokenized stocks. — Transparency and security: Existing brokers already have high levels of security with a proven security process. In fact, it’s the crypto exchanges and other DeFi platforms that have been beset by lax security, fraud and theft. — After-hours trading: Many brokers already offer after-hours, overnight and pre-market trading on existing stocks. While this is not 24/7 trading, brokers have been expanding access in recent years. Moreover, all-hours access to trading does not benefit long-term investors, who build wealth through the long-term success of the underlying business. Study after study shows that active trading underperforms passive investing. — “Democratization” of investing: Proponents of tokenization say that it gives access to private investments that are being hoarded by the wealthy. But giving a means to trade a stock — tokenizing it — does not mean that anyone will want to sell it to you. In fact, you should be skeptical when someone wants to sell you what they say is a great investment. (If it’s such a great investment, why are they letting you in on it? It’s not out of the kindness of their heart.) So, while tokenization may offer a few incremental benefits to individual investors, albeit with significant risks, what’s the real driver of tokenization? Who is actually going to benefit here? It’s the crypto industry trying to make inroads into traditional finance, say experts. “The crypto industry is waging a multi-pronged battle to get integrated into the financial system,” says Allen. The industry is working to “attract deep pockets” and bring more money into the fold, and tokenized stocks are part of that push, she explains. So much of the crypto world is about hyping digital currency as “the next big thing.” Part of that process is projecting bombastic price targets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ones that are always rising over time. Such hype can make cryptocurrency seem inevitable. As with cryptocurrency, one of the biggest use-cases for stock tokenization is (illegally) getting around existing laws (in this case, securities laws). So the full-bore adoption of stock tokenization has many potentially destructive effects, including the erosion of investor protections and robust securities laws that protect financial markets. Without these laws, it’s “scammer take all.” “Investors lose the benefit of the securities laws,” says Allen. She points out that what the crypto industry wants to run roughshod over are the very laws that they claim are roadblocks to their profits. ”We saw what happened in the 1920s and the lack of securities laws.” Tokenization presents significant risks to individual investors and the financial markets as a whole, while offering few benefits to investors that don’t already exist. Those who try out tokenized stocks should remain wary of their many risks amid an uncertain legal framework. ©2025 Bankrate.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

August 22, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. New York, NY, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mercurity Fintech Holding Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our company,” or “MFH”) (Nasdaq: MFH), a blockchain-powered fintech group, today announced that a broad range of institutional investors reported holdings in MFH in their latest regulatory filings. Recent 13F and related regulatory disclosures report institutional positions in MFH by major index and asset managers, global banks, and ETF sponsors, reflecting a larger and more diverse institutional holder base for MFH compared to prior periods. Reported filers include BlackRock, Geode Capital Management, State Street, Vanguard, Northern Trust, and others. The Company has also observed that several notable pension funds — including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund — have also slightly increased their holdings of the Company’s stock. Both new filers and additional positions from existing institutions contributed to the increase in institutional exposure, and largely follow the Company's inclusion in the Russell 2000 index. Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers for index funds and are commonly employed as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Though these index-driven acquisitions are primarily mechanical, reflecting index-related or passive investment activity, and should not be viewed as a strategic endorsement of the Company, MFH views the expanding institutional presence as a meaningful acknowledgement of its fintech and digital asset platform development. "Having more institutional investors on board is exciting for us," said Shi Qiu, CEO of MFH. "It not only brings more liquidity to our stock but also puts us in front of a wider investment community. While we understand much of this activity is potentially index-related, we're confident that as we continue building out our fintech capabilities and delivering results, these relationships will deepen." About the filingsThe summary above draws on Form 13F and related regulatory filings reported in early to mid-August 2025. Institutional holdings can change at any time, may be reported through multiple affiliated entities, and many positions are passive. References to institutional names are based solely on publicly available filings and are provided for informational purposes only.The inclusion of MFH in institutional portfolios does not necessarily represent an investment recommendation or active investment decision.

Title: Bitcoin’s Collective Action Problem

ByKorok Ray, Contributor. Its greatest asset is also its greatest liability. It is difficult to find legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin. The software was remarkably well-designed from the outset. The network has withstood attacks for over a decade, and the protocol uniquely combines cutting-edge computer science with Austrian economics. And of course, the massive institutional buying this year—along with retail participation since inception—is already proof that Bitcoin holds value in the marketplace. There are, of course, the usual criticisms: energy consumption, high fees, limited programmability, and scaling challenges. But these issues are not new; they’ve been discussed on the mailing list since Bitcoin's earliest days. Let me instead focus on what I believe to be the only real threat to Bitcoin—and it’s not a technical flaw in Bitcoin itself, but rather a challenge within the social structure surrounding it. Bitcoin is unique—not just among cryptocurrencies, but among social organizations in general—because no one is in charge. Unlike companies like Ripple, which have CEOs, or even altcoins like Ethereum, which have foundations, Bitcoin exists without a central authority. Satoshi disappeared, and now no single individual controls Bitcoin’s destiny. The closest thing to a governing body is the group of Core developers who maintain Bitcoin Core and decide on software updates. To the extent that anyone holds influence over Bitcoin, it is this group of developers. But even they are decentralized. They are scattered around the globe, and they themselves must respond to social consensus. Even if the Core devs were to push for a radical protocol change, node operators could simply reject the new version and continue running an older, backward-compatible one. As with everything in game theory, the mere threat of this type of rejection enforces an equilibrium—ensuring that Core developers conform to community expectations and avoid radical departures. So what’s the problem? A collective action problem arises when the benefits are shared, but the costs are private. The classic example is a group of farmers sharing a plot of land: no one wants to clean it; each farmer bears the full cost of the work but only receives a portion of the benefit. This problem appears in all environments with shared resources. Economic theory offers some solutions, but they are imperfect. The best approach is to introduce a third party who can create contracts that align private costs with social benefits. This research area is known as the private provision of public goods. A creative solution is the “Groupon” mechanism, where a shared benefit activates only if a sufficient number of individuals opt in. Economist Mark Bagnoli at Purdue wrote a paper on this in the 1990s. I also published a paper in Management Science in 2015 on how to allocate shared cloud computing resources among individual users. The core idea: users must be overcharged to prevent overconsumption of the shared resource. In Bitcoin, the challenge isn’t overuse of a shared resource, but rather the difficulty of collective decision-making. Because no one is in charge, progress stalls when there’s no clear winner among proposals. This, in my view, is what has happened with covenants. They’ve been proposed for over 7 years. Since then, no dominant proposal has emerged. And when no one is in charge, no proposal gets adopted. Quantum computing has been discussed as a long-term threat to Bitcoin’s digital signatures since the early mailing lists. Back then, it seemed distant. Even now, we’re still decades away. But it would be naive to think it will never arrive. This raises the question: what is the best post-quantum signature scheme for Bitcoin? This was a topic of discussion at the Quantum Summit at Presidio Bitcoin in July, where proposals included intricate tree-based hash functions. If one clearly superior post-quantum signature scheme emerges, I see no threat to Bitcoin. The challenge arises if multiple, roughly equal, proposals exist—each with different tradeoffs and no clear winner. This would be similar to the covenant situation. If the community fractures over which path to take, and no consensus emerges, adoption may be stalled. I see this as a tail risk—but a real one. Some argue that major Bitcoin holders—like BlackRock, Strategy, or a federation of “OGs”—could unite to push forward a single standard and prevent Bitcoin from being vulnerable to quantum attacks. But this raises a further question: if investors can reach consensus, why not the Core developers? The edge case here is that several post-quantum signature schemes are so equally compelling that no one can agree. And in that edge case, centralization has a benefit: it allows someone to make the final decision. I saw this dynamic firsthand while working in the George W. Bush White House. The president’s role in the policy process is to act as the final decision-maker. If the choice were obvious, it would have been settled by committees earlier. The very fact that an issue reaches the president’s desk means the staff is evenly split. The president is the tiebreaker. And that, ultimately, is the real function of a central executive. Let’s hope that among the post-quantum proposals, a clear winner emerges—so we can all upgrade peacefully and move to a secure, post-quantum Bitcoin future.

August 22, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: CertiK CertiK NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CertiK, the largest Web3 security services provider, released its 2025 Skynet Real World Asset (RWA) Security Report, providing a framework of structured criteria for users to perform due diligence and assess risks associated with various RWA protocols. RWAs are gaining prominence in the industry, as more users seek to unlock value by bringing traditional assets on-chain, thus benefiting from increased efficiency and accessibility during transfers. However, as CertiK notes, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop such RWAs also introduces complex security challenges that extend far beyond familiar smart contract vulnerabilities. Such hybrid security risks include oracle manipulation, custodial and counterparty failures, the unenforceability of legal frameworks, and fraudulent Proof-of-Reserve attestations. In this report, CertiK also provides data on the current threat landscape involving RWAs. For instance, direct losses from RWA-specific exploits reached approximately $14.6 million in the first half of 2025, following fluctuating annual losses of $6 million in 2024 and $17.9 million in 2023. As is the case with all decentralized products, as more users come on-chain, there will be more capital for malicious actors to exploit, hence the need for increased security. According to CertiK’s RWA framework detailed in the report, the highest-rated protocols, such as those offered by TradFi giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, exhibit strong security postures by integrating institutional-grade compliance, custody, and transparency. Additional projects in the top five on the Skynet RWA Leaderboard include Ondo Finance, PAX Gold, and Tether Gold. As CertiK notes, RWA growth is concentrated in key blockchains and protocols. Most RWA value currently resides on select blockchains, such as Ethereum, which means that the overall sustainability of the RWA market is dependent on the security and operational integrity of a few key players and their underlying chains. Consequently, proactive collaboration with leading security firms will be essential for both existing and future RWA projects. Download the full report here.

Title: Sixth All-Ireland win that bit more special for Byrne

It wasn't the first time she got her hands on the Brendan Martin Cup, but Martha Byrne nevertheless acknowledged that her latest TG4 All-Ireland SFC success with Dublin was a 'particularly special’ one. A starter for the four All-Ireland SFC titles the Jackies secured in succession from 2017 to 2020, Byrne lined out at centre-half-back when the capital county regained their top-tier crown with an impressive showpiece victory over Kerry in 2023. She featured in the same position at Croke Park on 3 August as Dublin overcame provincial rivals Meath on a final score of 2-16 to 0-10 – a comprehensive reverse of the All-Ireland championship final meeting of the same teams in 2021. This win helped to complete a successful first season at the helm for joint-managers Paul Casey and Derek Murray, who had previously served as selectors under highly-respected predecessor Mick Bohan. This is one of several reasons why Byrne believes her sixth All-Ireland triumph is up there as one of her best in a Dublin jersey. "As you come towards the end of your career, you kind of appreciate and realise that winning All-Irelands don’t just come. I think that made it a little bit more special. Particularly under Paul and Derek, who have been such brilliant coaches for us over the last few years," Byrne explained. "Obviously they had big shoes to fill when Mick left, so I think a lot of us were really keen to get over the line for them as well. It made it particularly special to win this one. I think sometimes when you go on a run you think ‘okay, we’re in a good place here to maybe win another one’. "When you lose quarter-finals and finals, that is when you start to realise that you really have to work extra hard to get into winning positions. It was a good run, but I think after the last few years, where we’ve had our ups and downs and won finals in ’23 and ’25, they’ve been even sweeter. Because we’ve had to really put our shoulder to the wheel to get over the line on those occasions." Prior to Nicole Owens rattling the net in the sixth minute of their victory over the Royals at GAA HQ earlier this month, Hannah Tyrrell got the ball rolling for Dublin in the Jones’ Road venue with a 0-02 salvo. It was fitting that this attacking pair made such an impact in the early exchanges of the contest as both players officially announced their retirements from inter-county football in the aftermath of the game. A debutant all the way back in 2012, Owens finished her Dublin senior odyssey with an excellent haul of five All-Ireland senior titles. Tyrrell did feature for the Sky Blues in the 2013 and 2014 inter-county seasons, before subsequently returning in 2021 after bringing the curtain down on an international rugby career that saw her representing Ireland at both 7s and 15s level. Top scorer with eight points when Dublin got the better of Kerry in the '23 decider, Tyrrell’s 0-05 tally against Meath at the beginning of the month helped her to claim the ZuCar Golden Boot for 2025. She was unfortunately forced off with a knee injury in the closing moments, but her contribution to the Dublin cause over the past five seasons has been immeasurable and Byrne was glad that she and Owens were able to sign off with another success. "Obviously it’s incredibly unfortunate that Hannah has done her knee and injured herself, but it was almost kind of nice in a way that she got a standing ovation and a send-off. A recognition of all the achievements she has gathered over the years across multiple sports. "Nicole and Hannah are both incredible sportswomen and obviously it’s sad that they’re retiring, but it was a great way to send them off." Byrne has been a considerable stalwart herself for Dublin, having first represented the county at the senior grade all the way back in 2013. Yet while the registered dietitian at Beaumont Hospital currently resides in Stoneybatter on the northside of the capital, her family home is actually in Bray, Co. Wicklow. However, she attended primary school in Scoil Lorcáin – located between Blackrock and Monkstown in south Dublin - and this led to her joining forces with Cuala. From there she ultimately progressed through the Sky Blue ranks and given the nature of her household, Byrne was always going to choose this path. "The principal of the primary school that I was in was a big Cuala man. Anyone I think that had any interest in playing camogie or football, he directed them straight away to Cuala. I think that’s how my older sister got involved in Cuala and then I was the same as well. "My parents are both from Dublin, so growing up my Dad would have brought me to Dublin games. Even though we were living in Wicklow, I have a granny who is a huge Dubs supporter herself. I think it was only ever going to be a Dublin club." After winning a Dublin Junior ‘A’ football championship crown with Cuala in 2017, Byrne played a pivotal role when the Dalkey-based outfit claimed an intermediate county title at the expense of Castleknock in 2020. Having begun their Go-Ahead Senior Championship Group B campaign for the current season with a draw at home to Na Fianna three days ago, Byrne and Cuala will renew acquaintances with Castleknock at Somerton Park next Wednesday (27 August). Further encounters with Clontarf and reigning Dublin and Leinster champions Kilmacud Crokes will follow on 10 September and 17 September respectively as Byrne continues her readjustment to the club scene. "You’ve had a few months of keeping the head down and working really hard, and then you have a little break and you go back at it again," Byrne added. "It will be a tough few weeks, but our club team, we feel like we’re in a really good place between the players and the coaches that we have. We’re just going to have to trust the process, put the work in and hope that we can get the right results." © RTÉ 2025.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) has appointedÂ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding Vice-Chairman AndrÃ© Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. According to Brighteon AI's Enoch,Â Fink, who co-founded the world's largest asset management firm in 1988, has long advocated for stakeholder capitalism and sustainable investing. Meanwhile, Hoffmann, a prominent environmental philanthropist and sustainability advocate, has hailed from the founding family of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant and has held key roles in sustainability and philanthropy, including leadership at the WWF International and the Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society (INSEAD), while driving Roche's focus on innovation in healthcare and corporate responsibility Hoffman has served on the WEF board and supported numerous global health and ecological initiatives. In line with this,Â Fink and Hoffmann expressed a shared commitment to strengthening the Forum's mission amid growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. "We are honored to take on this leadership role on an interim basis at a pivotal time for the World Economic Forum. As the organization moves into a new chapter, we look ahead with clarity, purpose and confidence in the Forum's enduring mission.Â The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government and civil society has never been greater. We believe the Forum can serve as a unique catalyst for cooperation, one that fosters trust, identifies shared goals and turns dialogue into action," the co-chairs wrote in their joint statement published on the official WEF website on Aug. 15. (Related:Â CIA, WEF run the entire mainstream media empire.) The interim leadership will guide the Forum through a transitional period as it redefines its strategic priorities for the coming decade. "We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. We look forward to helping shape a more resilient and prosperous future, and to reinventing and strengthening the Forum as an indispensable institution for public-private cooperation," they added. WEF clears Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing after probe, citing "deep commitment" amid minor irregularities The announcement follows the Forum's closing of its internal investigation into itsÂ founder, Klaus Schwab, clearing him of any "wrongdoing." In April,Â an anonymous whistleblower letterÂ scrutinized Schwab's leadership practices, the WEF's governance and alleged blurring of lines between the Schwab family's personal activities and Forum resources. That same month, an investigation beganÂ â a day after Schwab abruptly stepped down as chairman, without explanation. Schwab filed a criminal complaint against the anonymous whistleblowers in May, but a spokesperson confirmed Friday that he intends to drop all legal actions now that the investigation has concluded.Â The Geneva-based organization said on Friday its board found "no evidence of material wrongdoing" by Schwab or his wife and longtime assistant, Hilde Schwab. Despite acknowledging "minor irregularities" stemming from blurred boundaries between personal contributions and organizational operations, the Forum concluded that these reflected Schwab's "deep commitment" rather than misconduct.

As the organization moves into a new chapter, we look ahead with clarity, purpose and confidence in the Forum's enduring mission.Â The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government and civil society has never been greater. We believe the Forum can serve as a unique catalyst for cooperation, one that fosters trust, identifies shared goals and turns dialogue into action," the co-chairs wrote in their joint statement published on the official WEF website on Aug. 15. (Related:Â CIA, WEF run the entire mainstream media empire.) The interim leadership will guide the Forum through a transitional period as it redefines its strategic priorities for the coming decade. "We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. We look forward to helping shape a more resilient and prosperous future, and to reinventing and strengthening the Forum as an indispensable institution for public-private cooperation," they added. WEF clears Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing after probe, citing "deep commitment" amid minor irregularities The announcement follows the Forum's closing of its internal investigation into itsÂ founder, Klaus Schwab, clearing him of any "wrongdoing." In April,Â an anonymous whistleblower letterÂ scrutinized Schwab's leadership practices, the WEF's governance and alleged blurring of lines between the Schwab family's personal activities and Forum resources. That same month, an investigation beganÂ â a day after Schwab abruptly stepped down as chairman, without explanation. Schwab filed a criminal complaint against the anonymous whistleblowers in May, but a spokesperson confirmed Friday that he intends to drop all legal actions now that the investigation has concluded.Â The Geneva-based organization said on Friday its board found "no evidence of material wrongdoing" by Schwab or his wife and longtime assistant, Hilde Schwab. Despite acknowledging "minor irregularities" stemming from blurred boundaries between personal contributions and organizational operations, the Forum concluded that these reflected Schwab's "deep commitment" rather than misconduct. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said.

Watch for two concrete gauges of patience: whether Saudi officials allow any new “process” optics to move in public while bombardment intensifies, and whether Emirati ministries let routine, mid?tier engagement with Israeli counterparts proceed on autopilot or begin to drag. The much-awaited Trump-Putin summit and talks with Zelensky failed to deliver on ceasefire expectations. In Anchorage, Trump and Putin met with minimal fanfare around Ukraine but, behind the scenes, a seismic shift was underway in Russia’s oil sector. On the same day as the summit, Putin issued a decree greenlighting ExxonMobil’s return to the Sakhalin-1 project, a major state-linked venture shelved in 2022 under sanctions (keep in mind, it’s a pathway to return, not a return itself). Exxon’s re-entry is conditional on helping roll back those very sanctions. This isn’t just corporate re-entry; it’s a political signal that Washington may be open, quietly, to leveraging energy firms as sanctions lifelines, which is exactly what traders were banking on. The revival of Exxon’s Sakhalin-1 involvement lays the groundwork for deeper economic reintegration, funding Russia’s oil expansion and infrastructure that suffered post-2022. Ukraine gets relegated to the talking points, while oil and energy firms, long sidelined by sanctions, become back channels for geopolitical recalibration (completely transactional geopolitics, which we are seeing elsewhere, as well, including in Libya. Elections in Guyana and troop movements off Venezuela’s coast are converging into a single fault line for the southern Caribbean. Georgetown is heading toward its September 1 vote with a new wildcard candidate, Azruddin Mohamed, whose gold-trading dynasty has been sanctioned by Washington for smuggling and tax evasion. His run under a freshly minted party is unlikely to deliver power, but even a small parliamentary bloc would inject sanctioned capital into the legislative process just as Guyana’s oil wealth transforms its economy. Across the border, Caracas is flexing hard: Maduro has mobilized millions of militia members in response to a U.S. task force of warships and 4,000 troops deployed off Venezuela’s coast. The choreography on both fronts matters. Guyana risks entangling its oil boom in sanctioned networks at the very moment it needs investor confidence, while Venezuela is doubling down on sovereignty theatrics to turn U.S. naval presence into domestic consolidation. This week has seen a quiet but vital turning point in Baghdad?Erbil relations. Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government have taken a significant step toward reviving northern crude exports. A formal mechanism has now been agreed: the KRG will retain a modest 50,000 bpd for local consumption, while the remainder will be channeled through SOMO for export. The agreement clears the federal checklist; what remains is the final hurdle, which is getting Ankara on board to reopen the pipeline. Yet the arrangement is only as real as Turkey allows it to be. Ankara still controls the tap, and until it agrees to reopen the pipeline, Baghdad and Erbil’s accord remains aspirational. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Black Hills (BKH) and NorthWestern Energy (NWE) agreed to merge in an all-stock deal creating a $15.4B regulated utility, one of the largest U.S. utility tie-ups this year. NorthWestern holders will get 0.98 BKH shares each, valuing NWE at $3.6B, with BKH shareholders owning 56% of the new company. The combined firm, headquartered in Rapid City, SD, will serve 2.1M customers across eight states, boosting planned capex beyond the $7.4B earmarked through 2029. Management projects EPS growth of 5–7% post-close in late 2026, up from the prior 4–6%, as AI-driven data centers and higher demand from crypto and households fuel grid investment needs. Peabody Energy (BTU) has scrapped its $3.78B bid for Anglo American’s (AAL) Bowen Basin coking coal mines, after trying and failing to cut the price following an April fire at Moranbah North. Peabody says the blaze triggered a material adverse change clause, a claim Anglo flatly rejects. The setback slows Anglo’s push to shed non-core coal assets after last year’s failed BHP takeover. Allgas Energy’s Queensland gas network has been put up for sale for about A$600M. The system stretches over 13,000 km of pipelines and supplies roughly 120,000 customers, making it one of the largest privately owned networks in the country. Macquarie Capital is running the process, and early signs point to plenty of interest given the steady cash flows. Owner APA Group is looking to slim down its portfolio and free up cash for other projects Santos (STO.AX) warned that ADNOC’s $18.7B takeover bid won’t hit its August 22 deadline, with the consortium asking for at least four more weeks to secure approvals. The delay rattled investors, knocking Santos shares down 3.5% to A$7.68—well below the A$8.89 per share offer—highlighting persistent skepticism. If completed, the deal would value Santos at A$36.4B enterprise value, the largest all-cash buyout in Australian history, but faces hurdles with regulators in Australia, PNG, and the U.S. The biggest sticking point remains Canberra’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which is unlikely to wave through Middle Eastern ownership of critical gas assets without scrutiny. Discovery & Development Aker BP (AKRBP.OL) and partners Equinor (EQNR.OL) and Orlen (PKN.WA) hit one of Norway’s biggest oil finds in a decade, uncovering 96–134 million boe at the Omega Alfa prospect in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery spans three licences, with Aker BP holding up to 47.7% and Equinor 40%. CEO Karl Johnny Hersvik called it a major commercial find, and the group plans to chase further upside nearby. The result materially boosts resources at Yggdrasil, one of the North Sea’s most active development hubs. Iraq inked an agreement in principle with Chevron (CVX) to develop the Nassiriya project, covering four exploration blocks plus producing fields. The deal marks a turnaround as Iraq improves contract terms to lure back majors after years of retreat. Recent reforms have already pulled in TotalEnergies (TTE) and BP (BP.L) with more than $50B committed. Nassiriya could eventually produce up to 600,000 bpd, making it one of Iraq’s most ambitious oil developments in years. Putin signed a decree reopening the door for ExxonMobil (XOM) to reclaim its former 30% stake in Sakhalin-1, three years after Moscow seized the project. The move coincided with Trump’s Alaska summit with Putin, where sanctions relief and new U.S.–Russia investment were key agenda points. Exxon had written off $4.6B when it exited Russia in 2022, and any return would hinge on Western sanctions being lifted plus new commitments like equipment supply and capital transfers. The decree also makes clear that foreign investors must actively support easing sanctions if they want back in, underscoring the political strings tied to Russia’s top Far East oil project. ExxonMobil (XOM) signed a massive deepwater exploration deal with Trinidad & Tobago, covering more than 2,700 square miles east of the island in waters 6,500 feet deep. The agreement comes after six months of negotiations and could lead to as much as $21.7B in spending if sizable reserves turn up, with seismic work due to start soon and drilling to follow. Exxon is aiming to mirror its Guyana play, leaning on shared infrastructure across the basin. Port of Spain, meanwhile, is pushing to revive its energy sector, with PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar stressing oversight while insisting the country won’t hold back on developing its resources. Saudi Aramco struck an $11B lease-and-leaseback deal with a BlackRock-led Global Infrastructure Partners consortium tied to its massive Jafurah unconventional gas project. The package includes gas processing and NGL facilities, but Aramco will still run the assets. Jafurah is estimated to hold 229 tcf of gas and 75 billion barrels of condensates, making it one of the world’s largest unconventional gas fields. The deal gives Aramco fresh capital while underpinning long-term growth from its biggest gas play. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The chief executive officer of SOL Strategies has a strong belief in the potential of Bitcoin, despite recent setbacks by the top crypto asset. Leah Wald told members of the press she expects bitcoin to make a steep move before year end. Her baseline? The vaunted $175,000 mark – a price she called a conservative read compared to some loftier forecasts. The market has already surprised a lot of people — bitcoin hit about $124,000 recently — so big swings are not impossible. According to Wald, part of the push comes from big money moving in. She pointed to companies like BlackRock and high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood, and she referenced how comments from leaders like Larry Fink have shifted conversations. Those voices bring models and balance-sheet plans that, she said during a CNBC TV18 interview, support much higher price targets than people used to expect. The industry’s own scars are still visible. After the FTX collapse many firms were de-banked and trust took a hit. But Wald argues that the picture has changed: banks and asset managers are opening doors again, and that makes it easier for large managers to put serious capital into crypto. That doesn’t erase risk though, but it does change how big investors approach the market. Based on reports, some forecasts stretch far beyond this year. Wald mentioned projections showing bitcoin at $1 million by 2030, a level that would dwarf current prices. Those long-range calls are driven by assumptions about adoption, limited supply and the role bitcoin could play in institutional portfolios. Whether reality matches those models is another question. Shorter-term math matters too. If bitcoin were to reach $175,000 before year end, that would be a rapid climb from recent levels around $124,000. Traders and managers watching volatility know such moves can happen, but they also know the path is rarely straight. Expectations, flows, and news — all of it moves markets fast. Wald says crypto is no longer just about quick gains. She sees a bigger change: mainstream finance is being rebuilt on blockchain tools, she said, and that shift is moving the conversation away from short-term trading toward how the system is built and run. Nation-states thinking about adoption and big asset managers planning custody services are part of that picture, she added, and those pieces matter for how prices form.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The regulator first issued a consent order to Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank, in 2022 due to its “failure to adopt and implement a compliance program” that satisfactorily covered the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. “The OCC believes that the safety and soundness of the bank and its compliance with laws and regulations does not require the continued existence of the order,” the termination order reads. In 2021, Anchorage Digital made history when the @USOCC granted us a national bank charter to serve as a full-scale digital asset bank, providing custody, trading, settlement, governance, and other regulated services for institutions. pic.twitter.com/sMKwq3tTfv — Anchorage Digital ⚓ Prime is Live (@Anchorage) August 21, 2025 Anchorage Digital received conditional approval from the OCC in 2021, allowing it to offer crypto custody services to its customers and making it the first federally chartered bank to custody digital assets. After demonstrating the appropriate compliance, the consent order has now been terminated. “When we applied for that charter, we knew what we were signing up for: the path forward was uncharted for any crypto company, and at the time, many in our industry—and most of Washington—felt that digital assets and regulation were like oil and water,” said Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley in a statement Thursday. “We embarked on that path not because it was easy, but because we knew it was the right long-term move for the industry—laying the foundation for trust, safety, and durability in the years ahead,” he added. “And in an industry intent on ‘going to the moon,’ the seeming impossibility of our federal charter mission lit a fire under us from the start.” The South Dakota-based firm specializes in custody, staking, trading, and governance for its members. In April, BlackRock chose Anchorage to custody some of the Bitcoin and Ethereum held for the asset manager’s industry-leading spot ETFs. In May, the OCC affirmed that national banks it oversees can buy, sell, and manage any crypto assets in their custody. Since that time, stablecoin issuer Circle as well as Ripple and Paxos have applied for charters that would make them nationally regulated banks.

The bank said it had partnered with digital platforms ADDX, DigiFT, and HydraX to distribute the product. DBS told Decrypt that the first tokenized structured note will be linked to the performance of Bitcoin. Structured notes blend debt securities and derivatives contracts to provide investors with exposure to a range of assets, including stocks and commodities. They are linked to an underlying asset and pay the investor a regular return. With DBS's latest product, the underlying asset will be cryptocurrencies. "The note structure provides investors with a cash payout when cryptocurrency prices rise, enabling them to build exposure to the asset class without having to manage any cryptocurrency," the bank said. "The note is also structured to mitigate potential losses should cryptocurrency prices decline." DBS said that by tokenizing such assets, they can become "more fungible and easier to trade." "Asset tokenisation is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure," DBS' Head of Foreign Exchange and Digital Assets, Global Financial Markets, Li Zhen, said. "Our first tokenised product, a crypto-linked note, also addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets," he added. The bank isn't the first to offer such a product. Wall Street giant BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, debuted its first tokenized fund last year. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum. And BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has repeatedly spoken about tokenizing assets. Other major financial services firms are also exploring tokenization initiatives, including Bank of America and Citi. In a report this May, the World Economic Forum said that tokenization had "the potential to unlock the next generation of value exchange in financial markets." "While barriers remain, momentum continues to build, and financial institutions, policy-makers and technology providers need to coordinate regulation, interoperability and consumer protections to safely usher in this evolution," the authors of "Asset Tokenization in Financial Markets: The Next Generation of Value Exchange" wrote.

Title: Trillions and Trillions of Dollars to Pour into Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu: Kraken Co-CEO

Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi believes that we are still very early in the crypto adoption cycle, and trillions and trillions of dollars are going to pour into the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the near future. The crypto executive gave these comments during the ongoing Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in the USA. According to Sethi: “….., the way we think about it is very linear, and it is hard to think about what is exponential or non-linear. The way I like to think about it is that we are just in the really, really early innings of what is going to be trillions and trillions of dollars coming into the ecosystem, building against it, and the value is going to continue to grow….” Sethi co-executed the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange during the first altcoin boom, and the platform has since become a popular choice among crypto traders. In addition to Kraken, he is the chairman of Tribe Capital and has invested in over 100 tech companies overall. He was invited to speak at the Blockchain symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and the host discussed a wide range of topics with him. He is upbeat about the future of the cryptocurrency economy and the space it is creating for entrepreneurs. What Sethi is referring to here is the fact that institutional investors are increasingly focusing their attention on the digital currency revolution. These big players, along with increasing interest in the retail investment scene, can pour trillions and trillions of dollars into crypto in the coming years, if not months. According to Bill Miller IV, a renowned American institutional investor, a small fraction of the money held by retirement funds around the world can make a big difference. The portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners said during a recent CNBC interview: “1% of the 60 trillion in global retirement funds could boost Bitcoin’s price by $30k.” This scenario is within the realm of possibility as multiple top retirement funds have expressed a desire to invest in Bitcoin, and many have already done it, albeit at a smaller scale. On the other side of the investment spectrum, big asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck are heavily invested in digital currency already. Together, these major capital players can drive the digital currency market to unprecedented heights.

August 21, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS / XICE: OCS) (“Oculis”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on breakthrough innovations to address significant unmet medical needs in ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and provided an overview of the Company’s progress. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, states: “We maintain a strong focus on execution to advance our portfolio of highly differentiated assets in areas with significant unmet medical needs. The rapid enrollment in both Phase 3 DIAMOND trials highlights strong support from the medical community for OCS-01, which aims to become the first eye drop treatment for diabetic macular edema, with topline results expected in Q2 2026. We are also preparing Licaminlimab’s (OCS-02) genotype-based Phase 2/3 trial in 2H 2025 to deliver a first personalized medicine treatment in dry eye disease. Moreover, encouraging Phase 2 ACUITY trial results for Privosegtor (OCS-05) in acute optic neuritis, which showed significant improvement in visual function as well as anatomical and biological neuroprotective benefits, are unlocking a new era of potential therapies targeting neuronal and axonal preservation, and addressing a long-standing gap in neuroprotection for the first time. These strong efficacy signals open opportunities across ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, and neurology.” Recent Clinical Highlights and Upcoming Milestones: Second Half 2025 Financial Results As of June 30, 2025, Oculis held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of CHF 160.3 million or $201.3 million. Research and development expenses were CHF 14.9 million or $18.1 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 16.5 million or $18.2 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of two completed trials in 2024, partially offset by ongoing trials and increased R&D personnel-related costs. General and administrative expenses were CHF 6.1 million or $7.4 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 6.3 million or $6.9 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in external professional services costs incurred in the prior year period. Year-to-date net loss was CHF 58.6 million or $67.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 36.9 million or $41.5 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in clinical development programs and a CHF 10.4 million or $12.1 million increase in the non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant liabilities as a result of appreciation of underlying warrant fair value. Upcoming Events: Medical Conferences and Industry Events Investor Conferences About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs. Oculis’ highly differentiated late-stage clinical pipeline includes three core product candidates: OCS-01, an eye drop in pivotal registration studies, aiming to become the first non-invasive topical treatment for diabetic macular edema; Privosegtor (OCS-05), a neuroprotective candidate in Phase 2 for acute optic neuritis, with potentially broad clinical applications in various neuro-ophthalmic and neurological diseases; and Licaminlimab (OCS-02), a novel topical anti-TNFα in Phase 2, being developed with a genotype-based approach to drive personalized medicine in dry eye disease. Headquartered in Switzerland with operations in the U.S. and Iceland, Oculis is led by an experienced management team with a successful track record and supported by leading international healthcare investors.

General and administrative expenses were CHF 6.1 million or $7.4 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 6.3 million or $6.9 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in external professional services costs incurred in the prior year period. Year-to-date net loss was CHF 58.6 million or $67.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 36.9 million or $41.5 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in clinical development programs and a CHF 10.4 million or $12.1 million increase in the non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant liabilities as a result of appreciation of underlying warrant fair value.

FRANKLIN, TN — According to sources, a local Gen Z college graduate $200,000 in debt with a minimum wage job was celebrating by shopping for a new $750,000 home at 20% interest. "I worked hard and followed the rules, and now it's time to reap the benefits," said Liam Oliver Franklin, who recently acquired a highly sought-after job in his field for $7.25 per hour. "Now, should I buy the 1-bedroom house in the slums for $750,000, or the 1-bedroom house in the suburbs for $1.2 million? Decisions, decisions." Franklin reportedly graduated with honors from a prestigious university after studying hard his entire life. He was told by admissions that his massive student loans would be paid off in no time. "My only concern is figuring out how to pay my $1800 per month loan payment while also affording a $12,000 house payment," he said. "I might have to get a job driving for DoorDash. They pay well, right?" At publishing time, Franklin had decided to settle for a $2,000 per month apartment owned by BlackRock while saving up for a home and earning money on the side by making racist memes to post on X.

Title: UK's third-largest steelworks collapses into government control

The UK's third-largest steelworks has been placed under government control, creating an uncertain future for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. Insolvency courts granted a compulsory winding up order sought by creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds by Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) – part of the Liberty Steel metals empire of controversial tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. The company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, will now be placed in the hands of the official receiver - a government appointed liquidator - and special managers from consultancy firm Teneo. The government has agreed to cover the ongoing wages and costs of the plant while a buyer is sought. Following the High Court decision on Thursday, Liberty Steel's chief transformation officer Jeffrey Kabel told the BBC he was "really disappointed" as he thought they had "presented a very good case". "We are by far the best company to run this business. We've run it for 10 years. Put a lot of blood, sweat and a huge amount of money into it," he said. Lawyers for Mr Gupta had applied for a four-week adjournment for time to place the company in a "pre-pack administration", which allows an insolvent company to sell its assets to a bidder. He wanted funding from investment giant BlackRock and Fidera, which invests in distressed companies, to buy back the business. Winding up the company, his lawyers argued, could place the business in "free fall" and incur significant disruption, cost and risk to a nationally important steel company and its staff. The judge found the firm was "hopelessly insolvent" with £600,000 in the bank, a monthly wage bill of £3.7m, supported by a parent group that has 15 entities in insolvency proceedings across nine jurisdictions. Lawyer for the creditors, Ryan Perkins, argued UK steel-making would be better served if the company's assets were sold off with assistance from independent special managers acting on behalf of the government after it is wound up, rather than allowing administrators appointed by Mr Gupta to conduct the process. Liberty Steel Group's finances were upended when its main lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed owing billions to investors including UBS. Those investors are part of the creditor group that applied for the winding up petition. Mr Gupta's plan to place SSUK in administration then immediately buy it out again would have allowed the company to largely shed those debts. Mr Kabel said the company was still hopeful it could buy SSUK back due to Blackrock and others "supporting us". In court, creditors highlighted how SSUK had not published financial statements since 2019 and its direct parent company, based in Singapore, was itself subject to insolvency proceedings. The government will now be responsible for the operational and financial risks of the company, which has produced next to no steel for over a year. A spokesperson for the government said that it remains "committed to a bright and sustainable future" for steelmaking in the UK. In response to a question about British Steel in Scunthorpe, the first steel company the government seized control of in April, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Labour wanted to ensure the UK kept "primary steel making capacity here". "That's why the steel strategy alter on this year will set out the long term direction for the industry," she said. Speaking from outside the Sheffield site, mayor of South Yorkshire Oliver Coppard said it was "good news" the government had stepped in to take control and end the uncertainty for workers. But he told the BBC the government's next job is to ensure the steelworks now have "the brightest possible future". George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said there was a "strategic imperative" to produce steel in the UK, particularly for the defence industry. The court decision comes after the government took over day to day running of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant in April to prevent its Chinese owners from closing its steel furnaces. The entire industry has struggled with high energy prices, cheaper products from overseas and the blow to exports to the US caused by 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Following Thursday's court decision, the GMB union said it was "another tragedy for UK steel". Chris Williamson has worked at the Rotherham site for more than 25 years and is a union rep for Community union. He told the BBC the special managers had already arrived on site, and said the court's decision "puts a closure on things" but workers wanted "guarantees on pay and pensions". Mr Williamson said the Rotherham plant had not produced steel since July 2024, with most of the workers on a form of furlough, being paid 85% of their wages. "We just want certainty and to start producing steel again", he said. With additional reporting from Pritti Mistry and Ollie Smith Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.
