Title: Foremost Meme Index Presale to Skyrocket as SEC Approves New ETFs

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked Bitwise’s application for the third Bitcoin-Ethereum exchange-traded fund ($BTC-$ETH ETF) in the US. The regulator hasn’t yet approved the ETF but might do so soon, which would allow Bitwise clients to gain indirect exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies at once. While institutional investors are dipping their toes in crypto through ETFs, the degen community is discovering traditional investment vehicles like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) could pioneer this new trend. Bitwise cleared the first resistance on the path to its ETF approval – the 19b-4 form. Now, the issuer awaits the approval of the S-1 form for the fund to hit the market. Earlier this week, Tuttle Capital also filed for ten altcoin ETFs, including meme coins $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and $BONK. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart points out that ETF issuers are probing the SEC’s boundaries. The SEC has already greenlit Canary Capital’s $LTC ETF, so the question is – where will regulators draw the line? The rapid growth of the $BTC ETF sector is a good case in point. The first spot $BTC ETFs by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale were approved in January 2024. A year later, there are 12 US $BTC ETFs with total cumulative inflows of $40.18B. Yesterday’s $BTC ETF inflows alone amounted to $588M, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leading the charge ($321M). US $ETH spot ETFs also recorded $67.77M inflows yesterday, bringing the total inflows to $2.73B. Partly due to the accelerated institutional adoption driven by ETFs, $BTC rose 143% year-to-date and now trades at $$104K. If the SEC were to approve altcoin ETFs, the entire crypto market would surge due to added legitimacy and accessibility. While the Wall Street guys explore crypto through ETFs, degen traders tap into stock market products like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) resolves the two main hurdles of meme coin investors – finding promising coins and managing risk. It introduces four meme coin indexes that cater to different risk appetites: Titan (the least volatile), Moonshot and MidCap (mid volatility), and Frenzy (high-risk, high-rewards assets). The meme coin market cap amassed $100B. New tokens enter the arena every day, and the leaderboard can change in the bat of an eye. That’s why putting all your hard-earned money into one project isn’t the best strategy. By investing in eight tokens instead of one, you spread risk and offset potential losses, thus enjoying higher average returns. Early adopters have already invested $3.1M in the $MEMEX presale and staked 139M tokens at a 718% dynamic APY. Beyond providing access to Meme Index baskets, the $MEMEX token gives its holders governance rights to steer the project’s direction. The lines between old-school finance and crypto are blurring. The SEC’s warming up to crypto ETFs – it has already said yes to $BTC and $ETH, so altcoins and even meme coins could be next. This means Wall Street is finally taking crypto seriously. And with projects like Meme Index, we see degens embracing the tried and tested investment strategies. All of this means one thing – there’s no way of stopping the crypto train. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any project. Even the broader bull run and strong project fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's 15 Best European AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Iberdrola, S.A. (OTC:IBDRY) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks. In August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected companies based in Europe that have been benefiting from the AI boom. An important investor note by investment bank Morgan Stanley on European AI stocks formed the basis for this list. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Wind turbines against a backdrop of the sky, signifying the power of renewable energy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/A Iberdrola, S.A. (OTC:IBDRY) is a Spanish firm that engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France, and Australia. Iberdrola's financial performance demonstrates significant growth, with a reported net profit of €5.5 billion and an EBITDA of €13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024. This success is partly attributed to the company's strategic investments in AI to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement. Collaborating with AWS, Iberdrola is developing generative AI applications to optimize energy production. AI data centers have created a need for power that is likely to drive utility firms towards the upgradation of their existing capacities to accommodate rising demand. Overall IBDRY ranks 11th on our list of Morgan Stanley's European AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of IBDRY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than IBDRY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the second half of 2024, the firm posted copper production of 489,000 tonnes, nearly 6% higher than the first half of 2024. Copper demand has surged due to the AI trends sweeping the business world. According to commodity trader Trafigura, copper demand linked to data centers and AI could add up to one million tons by 2030. This, in turn, would lead to supply deficits, driving prices upwards. Glencore is in a prime position to capitalize on these tailwinds. Overall GLNCY ranks 13th on our list of Morgan Stanley's European AI stocks.

Title: Trump’s crypto order could ‘break Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle’ – Bitwise predicts trillions in new capital
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/trumps-crypto-order-could-break-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-bitwise-predicts-trillions-in-new-capital/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T08:00:43Z
Full Content:
Is Bitcoin’s infamous four-year cycle coming to an end? Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes that President Donald Trump’s latest crypto executive order could upend the long-standing four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined the crypto market for over a decade. According to him, this regulatory shift can challenge the widely accepted market pattern, potentially altering how investors approach digital assets. With growing speculation about Trump’s influence on the crypto industry, this move could mark the beginning of a new market dynamic. It might diverge from historical trends and reshape expectations for the future of cryptocurrencies. Remarking on the same, Hougan wrote in a note to clients on 29 January. The note said, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto,” “We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” Historically, Bitcoin [BTC] has followed a predictable four-year cycle, with three years of strong gains followed by a significant correction ranging from 58% to 74%. According to Hougan, this pattern has held true, with 2023 and 2024 delivering impressive returns, setting expectations for another strong year in 2025. However, he believes that investors are beginning to question whether 2026 could bring a market reset. While many attribute the cycle to Bitcoin’s halving events, Hougan claimed that broader market psychology and speculative behavior play a more significant role, shaped by key industry events such as exchange launches, major collapses, and regulatory crackdowns. He added, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto. And I think it will be: We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” According to Hougan, the current mainstream crypto cycle emerged from the market turmoil of 2022, marked by the collapse of firms like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius. The turning point came on 10 March 2023, when Grayscale secured an initial victory in its legal battle against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their launch in January 2024 attracted institutional investors, driving Bitcoin’s price from approximately $22,000 to over $100,000 within a year – Signifying crypto’s shift into the mainstream. Worth pointing out, however, that Hougan sees the timing as the biggest challenge ahead. While regulatory shifts and political developments in Washington favor long-term crypto growth, their full impact may take years to materialize. In fact, if these effects are only felt by 2026, Hougan questioned whether another “crypto winter” in 2025 would align with past market cycles. He said, “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While the crypto market is evolving, Bitwise’s CIO believes the traditional four-year cycle is not entirely behind us. As the bull market progresses, increasing leverage could still lead to corrections. However, with the industry’s growing maturity, he expects these downturns to be less severe and shorter in duration, compared to previous cycles. While volatility remains a factor, the resilience of the crypto space may help cushion future pullbacks, marking a shift in how market cycles play out. In conclusion, he put it best when he said, “As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Paul Costelloe: ‘I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain'

He will be 80 in June but veteran Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe shows no sign of slowing down. He continues to show at London Fashion Week, which he has done for the past 40 years as well as designing homewares, womenswear and menswear lines for Dunnes Stores. Last September, he launched his first bridal collection called Primavera, 15 dresses inspired by his couture collection. He also has a rake of profitable licenses including a jewellery and accessories collection for the American QVC shopping channel. We meet at his Monkstown home, bought in 1984, a beautiful Regency building which, after he moved to London in 1999, was rented to a French family. Adjoining it is a converted coach house where his mother-in-law resided until recently. On this brief visit to Dublin, he is staying there with his wife Anne and their son William, design director of the company, a gifted artist who trained at the Chelsea School of Art. Dressed casually in a blue hoodie and jeans, Costelloe reflects on his early career over coffee in the kitchen, recalling his first fashion presentation in London in the early 1980s, with Northern Irish financial support, at the Hyde Park Hotel, along with John Rocha. “I was worried about making money because I had children. A journalist told me I needed to be more adventurous, and I remember feeling I was not as adventurous as I should have been. Now I am too adventurous,” he grins. Having trained in the Grafton Academy and worked in Paris with fashion designer Jacques Esterel, followed by two years in Milan with Rinascente and four in New York, he was invited to show at the inaugural British Designer Show (precursor of London Fashion Week) in Olympia in 1984. He told Vogue that he had wanted to be the Irish Ralph Lauren. Recalling that period, he mentions Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher that year. “Fashion made statements then,” he says admiringly. “Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” Youngest of a family of seven himself, he attributes the trait of pride to his late father, from whom he also inherited a love of textiles. “He was an industrious, courageous manufacturer in Dublin, a self-made man from Limerick with a glamorous American trophy wife from New York. Having American culture and Irish culture in those days was very extreme, but it produced plenty of interesting people though maybe not the happiest,” he concedes. Cosmetics and perfume is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside. The high points of his long career, he says, are easy to remember and he does not include, somewhat surprisingly, being the personal designer for Princess Diana, with whom he has always been associated. He lists them as follows: “winning the Caltex Art Competition for under 16s when I became something of a hero in Blackrock College for maybe a day or two. Designing the British Airways uniforms and travelling by Concorde to Hong Kong, Brazil and Argentina. The collaboration with Wedgwood on ceramics and porcelain in the north of England. Getting married two days before Christmas and having the car washed before we went into the church”. The Wedgwood tableware sold well in the US but not in Japan, so it was a disappointment. “I think big and I design big, but I didn’t consider the Japanese market so it slumped there,” he says. He also has memories of working in New York for four years designing lingerie for Larry Sunshine (“no sunshine and very ruthless”) on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building and designing a wedding dress for Tricia Nixon (Richard Nixon’s daughter) in 1971. Back in Ireland, he launched his first collection in 1978, remembered for its spectacular and tailored use of Irish linen from Strelitz and Moygashel in Northern Ireland and building the business to the point where he had concessions throughout the UK and free-standing stores. It was in one of these, in Windsor, where a lady in waiting for Princess Di first saw his work in 1983, opening the door to Kensington Palace. “Linen is my birthright for some reason,” he says of his regular use of the fabric. His first runway show in London a year later called Witness, based on the Harrison Ford Amish movie, featured those romantic linen dresses. A collaboration this year will bring that focus on linen full circle, but he is reluctant to divulge details. “As a designer I always looked for collaborations which are now quite common, but in those early days designers had to survive on their own merits. I prefer to use other people’s money to exploit my creativity. I always see financial advantage over good taste and that is how I have managed to give my children a decent education. It is about compromise and for a designer that’s not the best,” he says with a shrug. Which brings us to his long association with Dunnes and he is predictably enthusiastic, describing it as “an amazing company”. He explains how it started 15 years ago after Debenhams had launched a “Designers at Debenhams” brand introducing Jasper Conran and John Rocha. “I hadn’t been approached, so I contacted Margaret Heffernan and we met up and agreed to collaborate on homewares, which is still the foundation of the Paul Costelloe brand. I deal with Margaret directly – we have regular conversations and meet for coffee in the Herbert Park Hotel. I have a lot of respect for her and her daughter Ann (Heffernan), a doctor who looks after food and niece Sharon [McMahon], who is head of textiles.” He deals with and travels with Dunnes’ buyers. “My son William is just back from China and Hong Kong, where the [Dunnes] buyers wrangled the best products at the best prices. We go to India in the spring. We started womenswear in 2011 on the success of the homewares – menswear was slow to start because, typical males, they don’t move. Men are consistent – boringly so at times – but once you win them over, they really get enthusiastic, and I find that a lot more fun than women who say ‘why are you not making in my size?’” [ Our fashion designers make waves globally, so why don’t we value their cultural contribution here?Opens in new window ] Men’s wear, now in its 10th year, is stocked in 50 stores across the country and he gets accurate sales figures on a monthly basis on each collection. Though Dunnes does not publish accounts, Costelloe’s design management company has been posting profits since 2016, a year after his association with Ireland’s retail giant, though the latest accounts, to the end of August 2023, show a loss of €152,055 in 2023, down from a profit in 2022 of €511,410, a bumper year for the company. The loss trimmed accumulated profits at Paul Costelloe Design Management Ltd from €2.2 million to just over €2 million, according to a report in The Irish Times in June. He pays tribute to his financial director Gerry Mescal (a distant relative of the actor Paul), whom he dubs “Mr Cautious” and who has “looked after us for 40 years”. Costelloe’s advice to aspiring young fashion designers is always to have a good accountant. The catwalk shows have changed in their purpose since he first showed at London Fashion Week. “Before, the catwalk was the commercial vendor of the brand, so it was important that people buy into it. Now, it is a couture collection of one-off pieces which keeps up consumer brand awareness outside the UK and Ireland because [the show] gets covered all over the world, so it’s like an art gallery and not a collection. “People will say we saw your show on the TV in Hong Kong. It keeps it international, so it is worthwhile as we sell a lot online – handbags and other accessories, and that is growing.” Runway shows are expensive to stage – the last two in London cost €500,000. “That’s compared to the Italian shows, which cost a couple of a million each. But they have cosmetics and perfume and that is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside.” Free from the imperative commercial constraints of his first shows and for the high-street market, his London fashion collections are more spirited, flamboyant and colourful with that mix of tailoring and what the French call flou very much his signature. Left-handed, he continues to draw and paint and is physically active, with a 50-minute cycle to work every day from his home in Putney to his studio in central London. He plays tennis at weekends when he can. His sons are very supportive, and he works closely with William and loves going with him to Milan to select fabrics at the Milano Unica trade show. They are currently collaborating on a revamped revival of his brand Dressage launched in Brown Thomas in 1988. He retains clothing rights to the name. “Creativity and integrity will always win out and you take on board your past in your designs and we have done a lot over the years, but you don’t look back, we don’t indulge in the past. I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain,” he says. Painting is easier, he says. “You can sit on a wall and paint the landscape, but to design you must have discipline and know who is going to make your toile [test garment]. Sometimes my lovely drawings get lost in translation. We are hands on, it’s like farming, we work and feel with our hands.” On February 20th, he will once again open London Fashion Week at 9am, which he has been doing for the past 15 years, most recently in the ballroom of the Waldorf Hilton. But “it’s a poisoned chalice” he says with a wry grin.

Title: Will Chainlink (LINK) Overtake Cardano’s (ADA) Market Cap? Unlikely, But This Crypto Might

The ongoing market downturn has sparked discussion about which cryptocurrency will hold its group once the bull cycle returns. Crypto investors are wondering if Chainlink (LINK) can surpass Cardano’s (ADA) market value, especially as LINK struggles to rebound from a price drop. While Chainlink may not reach Cardano’s market cap anytime soon, Rexas Finance (RXS), a trending presale token, is set to achieve that soon. Chainlink’s Battle to Overtake Cardano by Market Cap Chainlink’s price drops, and FUD worries the crypto community about its future. At $19.88, LINK’s has dipped 39% in the past month. Its market cap hovers around $12.5 billion, compared to Cardano’s $35 billion. Despite recent encouraging developments like the Chainlink-Blackrock cooperation, LINK is unlikely to reach Cardano’s market worth. Chainlink’s price history, market dynamics, and growth are issues. Analysts estimate favorable market sentiment might push LINK’s price toward $43 or $50 per token in 2025. Chainlink’s rise may boost short-term growth, but it will struggle to match Cardano’s market position, which is backed by steady growth and community support. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Crypto Contender Set to Flip Cardano While Chainlink fights market sentiment, Rexas Finance simplifies tokenizing real-world assets. This move breaks down barriers that have kept investors out of valuable marketplaces like real estate, art, and commodities markets. This move makes Rexas Finance a leader in an industry expected to reach $50 billion by 2025 and $16 trillion by 2030. Tokenizing real-world assets is Rexas Finance’s novel solution to liquidity, fractional ownership, and global investment. Its blockchain approach offers better liquidity and investment options than traditional methods. The ecosystem relies on the utility and governance of Rexas Token (RXS), which the platform uses for liquidity and rewards. One of Rexas Finance’s biggest advantages is its user-friendly platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot let non-coders generate and manage tokens for real-world assets. This accessibility allows startups and major organizations to tokenize assets, democratizing investing and enhancing liquidity. Rexas Finance is also adding innovative features, such as Rexas GenAI, an AI-driven platform that simplifies NFT and digital asset generation, and Rexas AI Shield, which secures blockchain transactions. These new features help the project become a crypto market leader. The project’s focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) also helps it flourish. Rexas Finance is well-positioned to encourage DeFi adoption. Rexas Treasury delivers optimum yield farming options across several blockchains and the Rexas DeFi ecosystem, providing a secure and transparent platform for earning yields on digital assets. To attract both experienced investors and newbies to crypto, Rexas Finance is establishing a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges traditional asset management with the decentralized world. Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of remarkable, with each stage selling out ahead of schedule. Stage 11, which is now 97% complete, has increased the price by almost 6x, with RXS now priced at $0.175 per token. As the presale nears completion, Rexas Finance’s momentum is likely to grow, gaining attention from large investors. Upon the completion of the presale, RXS will debut on at least three of the top 10 global crypto exchanges, a move that will significantly enhance liquidity, push up the price, and extend the project’s market share. This forthcoming exchange debut is a crucial turning point for Rexas Finance. It will promote the token to a larger audience, thus strengthening its market presence. Rexas Finance will capitalize on its early success and grow swiftly in the next few months. Analysts forecast continuous growth and a parabolic price jump after its exchange listings. Conclusion Due to price volatility and market sentiment, Chainlink may struggle to overtake Cardano’s market cap, but Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking the next major crypto. A rising presale, a new approach to real-world asset tokenization, and a future listing on key exchanges position Rexas Finance for market growth. After acquiring a share of the $16 trillion RWA market and launching an exchange, Rexas Finance will be a powerful crypto competitor. With its focus on innovation, security, and liquidity, Rexas Finance may soon overtake Cardano’s market cap, making it an excellent investment for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts.

If approved, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC will serve as the custodian. At the same time, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing will act as the fund's transfer agent, according to a 19b-4 filing submitted Thursday. Grayscale’s XRP Trust is one of several investment vehicles the firm has converted or is in the process of converting amid surging demand for digital asset-based investment offerings. The move follows the firm's successful conversion of its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF on January 11, 2024, and its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF six months later. Grayscale has also sought SEC approval to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund—holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP—into a diversified multi-crypto ETF. In January 2025, the firm rebalanced the fund, increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s share to 90% while replacing Avalanche with Cardano. Issuers are rushing to gain approval for new crypto-based ETFs after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term in November. Along the campaign trail, Trump promised to shore up US regulations while making the country the crypto capital of the world. Grayscale’s XRP Trust holds roughly $16.1 million in assets under management. Its shares are held by American investor accounts seeking exposure to XRP “without the cost and complexity of purchasing the asset directly,” according to the filing. Investment trusts are closed-end funds that have a fixed number of shares, while ETFs are open-end funds that generate shares based on investor demand. As such, ETFs are typically more suitable investment vehicles to meet demand for an asset such as XRP, though that depends on investor preferences and market conditions. In any case, investor demand for XRP has proved particularly strong in recent weeks, with the token nearly breaking its all-time high of $3.40 earlier this month. XRP is trading at $3.13, up more than 525% in the past year. Investor interest in digital assets has soared in recent months, fueled by the launch of the widely popular spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. from major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Asset managers such as Rex Shares, Canary Capital, and 21 Shares have applied to launch XRP exchange-traded funds in recent months. At the same time, issuers have refiled a batch of previously rejected Solana ETF applications earlier this month. The filings form part of a broader crypto ETF boom under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, with issuers also applying to launch funds tracking the prices of Chainlink, Cardano, and Polkadot, as well as newer meme coins such as Official Trump (TRUMP) and BONK.

These changes include revising the names, investment objectives, and strategies of the Funds to de-emphasize the environmental, sustainability, and governance (“ESG”) factors associated with the Funds.

Title: Ireland’s unbeaten run ended by England as indiscipline and inaccuracy prove costly
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/01/30/irelands-unbeaten-run-ended-by-england-as-indiscipline-and-inaccuracy-prove-costly/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T22:10:34Z
Full Content:
The overwhelming emotion from Ireland’s post-match review will be one of regret, an opportunity lost to beat an England outfit that contained 10 World Cup winners before a record crowd for the biggest home attendance ever, 8,800 spectators, that braved the rain and wind on a filthy night. The home side were on a 13-match unbeaten streak in the Six Nations – they drew with England 32-32 last year in Bath – and during that time won two Six Nations Grand Slams and finished second last year. They hadn’t ever lost a match at Musgrave Park and their last home defeat was in Donnybrook in 2018 when they lost 41-38 to Wales Ireland played against 13 men for 10 minutes when England flanker Joel Kpoku received a red card for a high shot on the excellent Eoghan Smyth, while captain Tom Burrow followed for a yellow card offence soon after. England showed admirable grit in seeing out that time when short-handed and their superior power and resilience defensively frustrated the home side. In truth, Ireland will need to look to themselves, especially the indiscipline and the inaccuracy that tortured them relentlessly. Centre Connor Fahy was outstanding, Billy Corrigan, Alex Mullan and the backrow of Michael Foy, Bobby Power and Éanna McCarthy weren’t far behind, but just that little lack of composure and precision ultimately cost them. Ireland started in superb fashion, winning a tap down from the kick-off and then after a couple quick rucks, secondrow Corrigan accelerated through a gap. Although he took contact rather than spotting a supporting team-mate, it was an eloquent statement of intent. England hunted the tackle in pairs and there were some thunderous hits, an early reminder that telegraphing intent in the pass would carry a huge tariff for the receiver. A forward pass brought an end to the home side’s bright opening. Ireland, playing into the wind, also received a warning that kicking loosely would see them lose swathes of territory in those exchanges. There were some early bright notes, Charlie Molony’s superb catch, some of the running lines, the tackling, and in the first two scrums winning a free-kick and a penalty. England took the lead on 12 minutes, Ireland caught offside under pressure, and outhalf Benjamin Coen did the needful. Ireland’s response was immediate albeit not on the scoreboard, with Sam Wisniewski making a break before receiving a high shot from England fullback Jack Kinder. However, in the build-up Irish centre Eoghan Smyth received a shoulder to the head from Kpoku. The new law is an ass. It was high, late, with no wrap and after consultation with TMO Tual Trainini, referee Jermey Rozier showed a red card. Under the new rules, it is a 20-minute sanction, and the Racing player was replaced by George Timmons after the allotted time elapsed. Ireland lost loosehead prop Alex Usanov to a leg injury. Having kicked to the corner rather than the posts, Ireland conceded a penalty for blocking at the lineout and then another at a scrum. The home side continued to show glimpses of their attacking prowess, centre Connor Fahy particularly impressive, but also their toughness and courage on the gainline; some of the collisions were filling-loosening. England lost their captain Tom Burrow to a yellow card for illegally interfering with Clarke Logan at a ruck, but the home side failed to capitalise against the 13 men, first kicking the penalty into touch and goal and then compounding that with the concession of another 30 seconds later for a ruck infringement. Coen thumped it over to push England 6-0 in front, but Wisnewski reduced the deficit on 30 minutes after the visitors transgressed at a ruck. Having clawed their way back, the home side’s discipline let them down again, the Irish outhalf was correctly pinged for a high tackle, his counterpart Coen unerring again from long range. Ireland’s ability to work their way into the English 22 was impressive but the lack of accuracy when they got there was frustrating, turnovers and penalties allowing the visitors to escape unscathed. Even after a shemozzle in the in-goal area, the promise once again perished on a handling error. England had been restored to 15 players in time for the five-metre scrum. Ireland needed to be composed and clear-eyed on the resumption, be better disciplined. Kicking the ball dead from their 10-metre line and two penalties conceded in quick succession weren’t part of the plan. Wisniewski missed a difficult penalty chance but the home side’s capacity for self-inflicted wounds was injurious to ambition. The honest integrity of effort was undermined by the capacity for a misstep in thought or action that offered up possession and penalties to the visitors. There was a notable moment on 66 minutes when Shannon’s Oisín Minogue was introduced, one half of the first mother – Rosie Foley – and son to play for Ireland. England were awarded a penalty try after the home side illegally thwarted them on the line, costing them a player too. Ireland had two clearcut chances to grab a try with the superb Michel Foy denied twice, first by a fine last-ditch tackle and then by an unsympathetic pass when he would have enjoyed an unencumbered run-in. It kind of summed up the night. SCORING SEQUENCE – 12 mins: Coen pen, 0-3; 28: Coen pen, 0-6; 30: Wisniewski pen, 3-6; 35: Coen pen, 3-9. Half-time: 3-9. 67: penalty try, 3-16; 78: Coen pen, 3-19.

Title: Tempus AI, Inc. (TEM): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tempus-ai-inc-tem-bull-211723002.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Tempus AI, Inc. (TEM) on Substack by Market Moves by GBC. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TEM. Tempus AI, Inc. (TEM)'s share was trading at $50.77 as of Jan 29th. A doctor entering a patients results into a medical diagnostic computer. Tempus, a company founded by Eric Lefkofsky in 2015, emerged from a personal journey when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. This experience highlighted a crucial gap in the healthcare system—despite the advanced tools available to medical professionals, there was a lack of connection between patient data and clinical outcomes. Inspired by this, Lefkofsky's vision was to create a platform that would make medical tests "intelligent" by linking them to a vast database of patient outcomes, enhancing the ability to make informed healthcare decisions. Tempus has since evolved into a leader in the healthcare technology space, transforming the diagnostic and treatment process by integrating artificial intelligence (AI), massive data repositories, and advanced genomics. The core mission of Tempus is to shift the focus of medical tests from static snapshots of a patient's condition to dynamic, data-driven insights. The company's genomics division goes beyond traditional testing by leveraging genetic information to provide actionable insights on treatments that have been effective for patients with similar genetic profiles. This combination of cutting-edge technology and vast data sets has enabled Tempus to become the largest cancer testing company in the U.S., partnering with more than half of the country’s oncologists and reaching millions of patients. A key differentiator for Tempus is its massive database, which includes over 200 petabytes of de-identified healthcare data, including clinical records, genetic profiles, and imaging data from millions of patients. This "medical brain" is continuously growing and being updated with millions of new tests, and it is powered by AI to provide real-time insights that doctors can use to make better treatment decisions. Tempus has achieved remarkable results, including a 96% match rate for patients to appropriate treatments and clinical trials, a significant improvement over traditional methods. While oncology remains the company's focal point, Tempus has expanded its platform to other areas of medicine such as cardiology, neurology, and rare diseases. This expansion underscores the company’s commitment to refining its diagnostic tests and remaining at the forefront of medical innovation. Tempus has also developed strong partnerships with over 2,400 hospitals and 19 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies, solidifying its role in both advancing clinical treatments and supporting drug development. Despite its success, Tempus faces challenges, particularly with the availability of targeted therapies. While its genomic tests can identify mutations in patients' genetic codes, the number of therapies targeting these mutations remains limited, raising concerns about the immediate impact of some of its offerings. Additionally, Tempus is still operating at a loss. In its first earnings report, the company generated $166 million in revenue, but profitability remains elusive, with analysts projecting that it may not be achieved until 2025. Tempus's business model is centered around three main segments: genomics, data services, and AI applications. The genomics division offers next-generation sequencing (NGS) and molecular testing services, providing valuable insights into cancer and other diseases. AI-driven algorithms, such as Tempus NOW, COHORTS, and LINK, assist healthcare providers by matching patients with the best treatment options, clinical trials, and care pathways. In addition to its work in oncology, Tempus has expanded its AI applications to other areas, such as cardiology, radiology, and neurology, making the diagnostic process more accurate and enabling faster treatment planning. One of the company’s most notable achievements is its AI-powered data analysis, which not only aids healthcare providers but also supports pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in drug discovery and clinical trial design. Tempus’s collaborations with top pharmaceutical companies and its contracts, valued at over $900 million, highlight its integral role in accelerating the development of new treatments. Looking ahead, Tempus envisions a future where every medical test is intelligent and connected to a growing database of patient outcomes. Despite the challenges of limited targeted therapies and the need for profitability, the company’s strong growth trajectory, vast data assets, and deep industry partnerships position it for long-term success. Tempus's continued expansion into new medical areas and its increasing revenue base indicate substantial future potential. In FY 2024, Tempus reported $693 million in revenue, a 30% increase from the previous year. The company’s core genomics and data services businesses are performing well, and the pending acquisition of Ambry Genetics is expected to further fuel growth. Tempus is projected to generate $963 million in revenue by 2025, with a target of $1.17 billion by 2026. As the company approaches profitability, it is well-positioned to continue innovating and leading the AI-driven precision medicine space. Tempus offers an attractive investment opportunity, especially if its stock price stabilizes, allowing investors to enter at more favorable levels. Tempus AI, Inc. (TEM) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 7 hedge fund portfolios held TEM at the end of the third quarter which was 18 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of TEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Can We Still Solve Climate Change?

Saturday, February 1, 2025 With so much bad news about climate change lately, is it too late for the world to tackle the problem? Professor Felix Dodds and Chris Spence review the current state-of-play. A mother and her children are seen wading through a cloud of smoke at the Dandora dumpsite, Kenya's largest open landfill. Credit: Jackson Okata/IPS SAN FRANCISCO, California / APEX, North Carolina, Jan 30 2025 (IPS) - When it comes to climate change, the awful news has been coming thick and fast. We now know that in 2024, the Earth’s average temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. Extreme weather seems to be multiplying, with shocking fires in Los Angeles and storms striking Europe and America’s east coast since the start of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his country will turn its back on the ambitious Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ latest annual summit—COP29 in Azerbaijan—ended in November with complaints it had done too little to change the narrative. Some even questioned whether the UN’s ongoing exertions were a waste of time, and whether annual global climate summits were still worth doing? Are things really so bad? Let’s break down the news piece-by-piece and look at each issue in turn. How bad is it that we have broken the 1.5C ceiling? It’s pretty bad. It means we can expect extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and flooding to increase in frequency and severity. It’s also going to affect food production, harm many plant and animal species, and risk sending the world over several “tipping points”, such as faster melting of ice in the Arctic, Antarctic, and elsewhere, causing sea-level rise. If you don’t like that our weather is getting more extreme, then sadly it’s too late. We’ll all have to get used to it, and adapt accordingly. One piece of good news lost among all the big, bad headlines relates to the leadership at COP30. Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago has been chosen as president of COP30. He played a significant role in the Rio+20 negotiations and has been one of Brazil’s top civil servants for many years. His expertise when it comes to climate change and COPs is impressive That said, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some silver linings. First, the world has actually been doing a lot to fight back. Partly prompted by major international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, countries have been actively finding ways to reduce emissions, such as investing in green technologies and working on new policies that affect pretty much everything we do. Whether it’s new energy efficiency programmes in our homes and offices, efforts to protect our forests, or the rise in hybrid and electric vehicles, a lot is happening. Perhaps the biggest transformation has been the growth of solar and wind power, which is now considerably cheaper and more efficient that earlier sources of electricity like coal or natural gas. The pay-off is clear, with countries like the UK, Sweden, and Denmark already cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in half since the 1990s. Another silver lining of our efforts to cut emissions is expert projections for temperature rise in the longer term. Before the Paris Agreement, some were predicting temperatures to go up by 4-6C by 2100, which would be catastrophic for humanity and the planet; an extinction event for modern civilization. Now, the estimates sit around 2-2.8C, depending on whether countries honour the goals they’ve set themselves. These numbers are still bad, but nowhere near as terrifying as they were. So yes, 1.5 is bad and we will need to redouble our efforts to make sure it doesn’t get much worse. But we shouldn’t give up hope just yet. What does President Trump’s decision to leave the Paris Agreement mean? No one can deny that U.S. leadership greatly helps our global efforts to combat climate change. Still, there are several reasons why we shouldn’t panic. First, as mentioned above, the world is already on a long-term path to cut emissions. The new U.S. administration may wish to “drill, baby, drill,” but renewables will continue to rise. Why? Because they’re cheaper than the alternatives. As an experienced business leader, President Trump knows as well as anyone that companies are motivated by profits. They will look for the most cost-effective energy option. In many cases, this will mean renewable energy. Secondly, even if the U.S. does leave Paris and change its domestic policies, there is an inertia in systems. The outgoing Biden administration, which had pledged $3 billion for the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), has already handed over $2 billion. They’ve also spent much larger amounts on supporting the U.S. transition to a green economy. This is money the new President will not be able to take back. Plus, a country as big and powerful as America can’t turn its entire economy around overnight. For instance, during President Trump’s first term, emissions in the U.S. continued to fall, even if he himself did not support this. Thirdly, even American presidents aren’t all powerful. There are many other interests and alternative viewpoints in the U.S. Others who might disagree with President Trump will likely step up and try to fill the gap. For instance, business leader Michael Bloomberg has just announced that he will help cover U.S. financial obligations to the UN and its climate work. There is precedent for this, too. Back in the 2000s, a lot of progress was made on climate change at the state and city level throughout the U.S., even though President George W. Bush generally didn’t support it. Finally, there has been a shift in the centre of gravity when it comes to climate change. The U.S. remains important, but on climate change it matters less than it once did. Under Presidents Obama, Biden, and Trump himself, U.S. emissions have fallen. They now represent about 11% of the global total, down from 30% in 1970. These days, U.S. emissions are dwarfed by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). These are the countries whose leadership will be needed in the decade to come. There are signs that big corporate players are also turning away from their climate pledges. For instance, Blackrock just left the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition. What does this mean? The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was announced at COP26 in 2021. It brings together corporate leaders from the financial services sector to support the transition to an ambitious “net-zero” emissions economy. However, after the recent U.S. election, some big U.S. banks left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which is part of GFANZ. Now, Blackrock has left a similar coalition for asset managers; which is also a part of GFANZ. This is not good news. It probably marks a symbolic victory for politicians who had been pressuring big corporate interests to step back from their climate pledges. In some ways, it mirrors the recent abandonment by several big American companies of their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programmes. At this stage, it is hard to know how much of a genuine impact this will have. For every company trying to appease the Trump administration by backtracking, it is likely there will also be those—like insurance companies—whose profits are being so badly impacted by climate change that they will be unlikely to change their positions. The latest UN climate summit brought no major breakthroughs but it did achieve some modest successes. Credit: Shutterstock. Was COP29 really a failure? No. Although the latest annual UN climate summit didn’t result in any big breakthroughs, it did achieve some modest successes. For instance, wealthy industrialized nations agreed to increase annual funding for developing countries from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2030. This is far less than the US$1.3 trillion many experts believe is needed to combat climate change, though that number was included as a goal for 2035. Although US$300 billion is an improvement on the previous amount, it’s not what developing countries were hoping for, which was closer to $500 billion by 2030. Other outcomes from COP29 include agreement on standards for carbon markets, which means carbon trading is likely to increase and new finances might flow to the Global South. What’s more, several countries announced that they would strengthen their pledges—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—under the Paris Agreement. These included Azerbaijan, Brazil, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Shouldn’t COP29 have done a lot more, given the urgency of the climate crisis? As we have noted in an earlier article for IPS (“Are Climate Summits a Waste of Time?”), the UN climate process is designed to help us make incremental progress, year after year, decade after decade. And it has. It may seem like the pace of change is too slow—and it often is—but the UN has kept the ball moving over many, many years, and can take credit for helping us forward much more than we realize. Isn’t Azerbaijan an oil producer? Why hold meetings on climate change in fossil fuel states? Yes, it is. In fact, many countries that have hosted the annual UN climate summit in the past have also been fossil fuel states. These include the UAE, UK, Poland, South Africa, India, and Indonesia. In fact, Poland (a major coal producer), has hosted the climate COPs three times! Why is this? The hosting of the COPs is decided by the relevant regional groupings of the UN. So, each region gets its turn every few years to decide who hosts. The fact is, many countries produce fossil fuels, and often these are the ones with the financial and organizational capacity to host large events like a UN summit. As we have argued in the past (“Global Cooperation on Climate Change: What Have We Achieved and What Needs to Happen Next?”), we believe hosts should be judged not on their fossil fuel status, but on whether the annual COP they host is a success. If we judge the hosts by what the UN summits achieve, then fossil fuel countries have a mixed record. COP29 was not a breakout success, but the recent COPs in Egypt and the UAE achieved a surprising breakthrough, with agreement on a loss and damage fund. Also, some of these fossil fuel producers are slowly transitioning their economies away from selling oil, coal and gas. Azerbaijan, for instance, is promoting its tourism sector. Are UN climate COPs still worth holding? Do they need to change? As mentioned above, we believe UN climate summits are worth it, as they have helped the world make significant progress over the past thirty years. That said, some people think the COPs need to change how they operate. For instance, there were 65,000 people at COP29, but only a few thousand were actually involved in the UN negotiations. Isn’t this a sign something needs to be done differently? We think the critics miss the point. While it’s true that the UN climate COPs have become large and unwieldy, they also serve many purposes. First, the world pays attention to these mega-events, which ratchet up the political pressure. Prime ministers, presidents, and other world leaders often attend, knowing the eyes of the world are on them. This, too, raises expectations and sometimes leads to better outcomes. Not only that, but the COPs are often teeming with other folks from every sector and country, all eager to talk about what they are doing, listen to others, and build networks, coalitions, and alliances. Sometimes, these lead to powerful “coalitions of the willing”. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) mentioned earlier is an example of this, as is the Global Methane Pledge, a coalition uniting 159 participating countries (and the European Commission) in pursuit of a goal to cut methane emissions 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. On other occasions, participants can generate new ideas that eventually end up in the formal UN negotiations. Recent examples include discussions on agriculture and water management. Currently, it appears as if climate change in the context of oceans and human health may soon be added to the formal discussions. Of course, the climate COPs could certainly be improved. For instance, the number of formal agenda items could be reduced, since the negotiations are now very complex. However, the UN COPs continue to serve an important function and should, in our opinion, include a wide range of stakeholders.

Credit: Umar Manzoor Shah/IPS The next COP is taking place in Belém, Brazil in November 2025. What’s on the agenda, and what needs to happen before then? The road to COP30 in Brazil lies through Bonn, Germany, which is the location for the annual preparatory meeting each June. UN climate watchers will be paying close attention to the two-week session in Bonn to see if we are on track to make any breakthroughs in Brazil. The key issues where observers would like to see progress at COP30 include: We would also like to see evidence at COP30 that the recently-created Loss and Damage Fund is starting to have an impact, and that the role of oceans in climate change mitigation and adaptation is being taken more seriously. Even though the situation is bad, is there still hope? Yes. Despite the recent bad news, we remain optimistic. History shows we have made positive strides already. We are convinced now is the time to double down on global, collaborative efforts to combat climate change, and that the UN COPs provide important, regular milestones to meet, review our progress, and strengthen our pledges. One piece of good news lost among all the big, bad headlines relates to the leadership at COP30. Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago has been chosen as president of COP30. He played a significant role in the Rio+20 negotiations and has been one of Brazil’s top civil servants for many years. His expertise when it comes to climate change and COPs is impressive. The appointment of such a consummate professional is a positive sign of how seriously the Brazilian government is taking its responsibilities as the COP30 host.

Full Content:
Dunnes Stores head, Margaret Heffernan, is seeking the strike-out of High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin, has been interfered with by building work. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. Last week, he got interim High Court orders preventing Ms Heffernan and a number of other defendants from interfering with the property. He applied for the orders on an “ex parte” basis, which meant his was the only side presented to the court on that day. The defendants, who were not in court, were Ms Heffernan, Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding, Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and five gardaí based at Blackrock and Dundrum Garda stations. Mr O’Shaughnessy claims Mr Corcoran, among other things, unlawfully erected scaffolding around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th, 2022, to July 21st, 2022. He also claims Mr Corcoran unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of members of the gardaí. He claims Mr Curran, among other things, issued a scaffolding licence without verifying ownership claims, leading to such activities as an alleged roof removal without planning permission. He alleges the gardaí collaborated with Mr Corcoran’s men. He claims Ms Heffernan, chief executive of Dunnes, appropriated land that was historically part of his property to build a car park “possibly without lawful title”. He also claims she allowed the car park surrounding his property to be used for lowering a digger via a crane to facilitate “property destruction”. He is claiming €2.5 million in damages, including €2 million punitive damages. His ownership claims, he says, are under the Succession Act 1965, possessory title through long-term occupation and adverse possession. On Thursday, Martin Hayden SC, for Ms Heffernan, told Mr Justice David Nolan his client strongly denied all the allegations and was asking the court to strike out Mr O’Shaughnessy case. Mr Justice Nolan granted counsel, who made the application on an ex parte basis, liberty to bring a strike out application next week. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Saudi Allows Foreign Investment in Holy Cities - What it Means For Tourism
URL: http://skift.com/2025/01/30/saudi-allows-foreign-investment-in-holy-cities-what-it-means-for-tourism/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T16:24:26Z

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else Saudi Arabia has opened its holy cities, Makkah and Madinah, to foreign investment in real estate, aiming to enhance tourism development. The move aligns with Vision 2030's goal to diversify the economy beyond oil, with religious tourism being a significant economic contributor, generating $28.3 billion in 2023. Major projects like Masar Destination and Rua Al Madinah aim to transform urban areas and increase pilgrim capacity by 2030. Saudi Arabia has opened up foreign investment into real estate firms in its holy cities this week, a move that will support development in the kingdom's most lucrative tourism destinations. Listed companies that own real estate in Makkah and Madinah can now receive investment from non-Saudis. The Saudi market regulator Capital Market Authority said in a statement: "Through this announcement, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) aims to stimulate investment, enhance the attractiveness and efficiency of the capital market, and strengthen its regional and international competitiveness while supporting the local economy." "This includes attracting foreign capital and providing the necessary liquidity for current and future projects in Makkah and Madinah through the investment products available in the Saudi market, positioning it as a key funding source for these distinctive developmental projects." The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how the change could impact tourism. The CMA said that the foreign investment would be limited to shares, convertible debt instruments, or both, and would exclude "strategic foreign investors." It added that people without Saudi nationality would not be allowed to own more than 49% of shares of the firms involved. FDI, or foreign direct investment, is a hot topic in Saudi Arabia, especially regarding tourism projects. Multi-billion-dollar projects like Neom, Diriyah and Red Sea draw attention for the immense amount of public spending they have required. However, these projects are largely focused on the leisure market – religious tourism is the largest travel segment in Saudi by a wide margin. In 2023, religious tourism generated $28.3 billion in spending in Saudi and accounted for 11 of the 27 million international tourists that year, according to the Ministry of Tourism. Almost twice as many international travelers visited Saudi for religious purposes compared to leisure purposes in 2023. Tourism minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb affirmed at Davos this month that religious tourism is still the country's biggest driver. “Makkah and Madinah still top the list of the most visited destinations in Saudi Arabia, and attract millions of pilgrims annually, due to their religious importance.” The annual pilgrimage plays a vital role in the country's economy and upping the number of pilgrims is an integral part of its Vision 2030 economic reform agenda that aims to wean the economy off oil revenues. The two holy cities have their own set of projects, which can now be accelerated with foreign investment. Moreover, religious tourism is already a proven concept in Saudi, whereas leisure travel is still in its infancy, permitted only since 2019. Makkah: Madinah: Last April, BlackRock said it would be getting as much as $5 billion from Saudi's Public Investment Fund to invest in the region and build a Riyadh-based investment team. That same month, Saudi flew dozens of bankers to Neom – Saudi's biggest project – to explore “collaborative avenues,” according to Neom’s then-CEO Nadhmi Al-Nasr in a statement. The event drew representatives from 24 international banks and financial institutions, including those from Europe and the U.S. and in the region. Media reports have said parts of Neom, including The Line, has been scaling back. But according to Diriyah group CEO Jerry Inzerillo in a previous interview with Skift, that could merely reflect shifting priorities to other Saudi projects. "See, everybody is focused on what they think Neom is struggling with. Here’s how to look at it: There was a lot of money originally committed to Neom, but that money didn’t take into consideration the Kingdom would win the bid for the 2029 Winter Games in Trojena. So now, with the whole world going there to see the Winter Games, you need to put a lot of money into building Trojena." "Trojena could’ve been built after The Line, but now it’s before The Line. You need Trojena for 2029. A lot of it isn’t austerity, quite the opposite. It’s redirecting where the money goes."

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Ownership vs. ETF
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/01/29/crypto-for-advisors-crypto-ownership-vs-etf
Time Published: 2025-01-30T16:00:00Z

In today’s issue, Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors breaks down direct ownership of cryptocurrency vs. exchange-traded and wrapped funds and how they are expected to evolve through 2025. Then, Crews Enochs from Index Coop answers questions on the topic in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. The year 2024 marked a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market with the launch of bitcoin and ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), rapidly becoming some of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. According to various reports, global crypto ETPs amassed over $134 billion in assets under management (AUM) by November 2024. This success was notable even under the initial constraint of cash-only redemptions and contributions in the United States, a condition imposed by the SEC during the 2024 approvals. However, the landscape is set to evolve further in 2025 with anticipated changes in redemption mechanisms. The Shift to In-Kind Redemptions The SEC's decision in 2024 to not allow in-kind redemptions and contributions meant that only cash could be used for buying or selling ETF shares, which somewhat limited the potential of these financial products. This restriction is poised to change in 2025, with expectations that regulatory bodies will permit in-kind transactions for spot crypto ETFs. BlackRock has already filed for a rule change to enable in-kind redemptions for its Bitcoin ETF. This change will allow authorized participants to issue and redeem shares directly with Bitcoin or ether rather than cash, which will create a new liquidity flywheel between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Impact on Investors The cash-only approach previously left billions in cryptocurrency assets on the sidelines. Crypto-native investors, particularly those with low-basis assets, hesitated to convert their holdings into ETFs due to the substantial tax liabilities. With in-kind redemptions, these investors could move portions of their crypto wealth into ETFs without the immediate tax burden, thus accessing a broader range of traditional financial services like uncollateralized lending, mortgages, and private banking. For traditional investors who have gained exposure to cryptocurrencies through ETFs, the shift to in-kind redemptions provides an opportunity to dive deeper into the crypto ecosystem. These investors, having seen significant appreciation in their ETF holdings (bitcoin, for instance, was valued at around $46,800 at the time of ETF launch in January 2024, and ether at approximately $3,422 by mid-July 2024), can now convert their ETF shares into direct crypto holdings to explore DeFi products without needing new capital or facing tax implications. Catalysts for Change The recent withdrawal of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 21 (SAB-21) is another significant development. This will relieve financial institutions from recording digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, encouraging more banks and brokerages to engage with crypto custody and develop crypto-native financial products. An example of this trend is Coinbase's recent launch of a bitcoin-backed lending product in partnership with Morpho Labs, leveraging DeFi to back loans with Bitcoin. This year, we should expect to see a wave of traditional financial institutions following this path. Concurrently, a segment of investors gravitate towards self-custody, preferring to manage their assets independently to access crypto-native products without intermediaries. This trend underscores the importance of user-friendly and secure self-custody solutions in the evolving crypto landscape. The Convergence of TradFi and DeFi 2025 is shaping up to be when the boundaries between traditional and decentralized finance become increasingly blurred. With mechanisms like in-kind transactions and favorable regulatory changes, investors will likely interact with crypto-native platforms more seamlessly, often inadvertently. This convergence is expected to enhance inflows into both sectors, boosting volume and creating a more interconnected and liquid market. In conclusion, the evolution from ETF to direct ownership in the crypto space is not just about investment choice but about how these financial instruments are reshaping investor behavior and market dynamics. With in-kind redemptions on the horizon and regulatory changes like the withdrawal of SAB-21, 2025 will mark a significant chapter in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, further blurring the lines between traditional and on-chain financial rails. - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors Q. What sets on-chain crypto ownership apart from traditional ETFs? 24/7 market access is just the starting point. On-chain ownership unlocks true composability—allowing investors to use assets as collateral, earn yield, and participate in decentralized ecosystems. While ETFs provide exposure, on-chain assets provide unmatched flexibility and utility. Q. How does direct custody of crypto assets enhance investor flexibility compared to ETFs? Have you ever tried transferring holdings from one brokerage to another? How long did it take? Was it a nightmare of friction? Probably. With on-chain crypto ownership, you have complete control. You can self-custody your assets, deposit them with custodians, and move them in and out in minutes. What if an opportunity arises, and you need to act fast? You can get liquidity immediately by selling or borrowing against your assets—no waiting, no hassle, just action when needed. Q. Will the AI agents of the future prefer ETFs or tokenized assets on-chain? Imagine an AI agent managing investments. To buy an ETF, it would need to navigate KYC processes, work through a brokerage’s limited hours, and depend on human intermediaries. Tokenized assets on-chain eliminate these barriers, offering 24/7 access, seamless automation, and the composability to maximize efficiency. For AI-driven financial systems, the choice will be clear: DeFi. - Crews Enochs, ecosystem growth lead, Index Coop Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Title: Apollo Unveils Tokenized Private Credit Fund With Securitize as Blockchain Deepens Links to Traditional Finance

Apollo, an investment firm with over $730 billion in assets under management, is offering investors a new tokenized private credit fund with the help of security token specialist Securitize. Accessed via the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED) feeder fund, the token is the first public on-chain offering for accredited investors of Apollo and also the first integration for Securitize with the Solana blockchain, as well as with Ink, a layer-2 network built by the Kraken crypto exchange. Ethereum, Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon are also initial launchpads for the tokenized fund. Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, which has more than $1.2 billion in managed assets, invests in corporate direct lending, asset-backed finance as well as performing, dislocated and structured credit, the firm said. The fund delivered an 11.7% return in 2024 compared with around 4.5% on U.S. Treasuries. Christine Moy, a partner leading digital assets, data and AI strategy at Apollo, said the fund was chosen because it has a daily subscription and daily net asset value (NAV) structure that’s well suited for seamless and efficient blockchain-based markets. “For those that are trying to build a diversified portfolio on-chain, it serves as a higher yielding complement to stablecoins, tokenized treasuries and money market funds,” Moy said in an interview. “But it’s also a diversifier to the more volatile crypto native yield products that are out there. So it can help complete the picture of the different assets you would need in an on-chain diversified portfolio.” There’s been something of a rush among traditional finance firms to tokenize so-called real world assets (RWAs), with blockchain-based versions of U.S. Treasuries being the largest and most liquid market to emerge. As of 2023, global private credit assets under management reached approximately $2.1 trillion, a fourfold increase from a decade earlier, according to Securitize. Private credit tokens are less common, but they open up a new space for on-chain assets, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo. “Private credit is an area that’s been exploding of late, and we have been among the pioneers in this area of tokenization having already launched a top-tier private credit fund token with Hamilton Lane,” Domingo said in an interview. “Private credit with a higher yield is a good complement to treasuries especially in a scenario with interest rates coming down.” Securitize is the tokenization partner of BlackRock and the digital transfer agent for the asset manager’s BUIDL money market fund token. For Apollo, Securitize is using its partnership with Wormhole, a developer platform that allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other, to offer a multichain approach out of the gate. Apollo has participated in some tests of tokenized assets such as a proof of concept last year involving JPMorgan, carried out under the auspices of Project Guardian, a collaborative effort led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Moy, a longtime Web3 strategist who previously worked on JPMorgan’s blockchain and led projects like Intraday Repo, looked ahead to working in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). “Tokenizing Apollo’s products is just the beginning,” Moy said. “We're excited to collaborate with leading teams in the digital assets ecosystem to design modern treasury management, automatically rebalancing investment portfolios at scale, smart contract-driven collateral management, and in the future, potentially the enablement of secondary liquidity for alternative assets.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

This post was originally published on January 29 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stabilized after teetering on the edge of another tumble yesterday, with traders still reeling from a sudden sell-off that sparked fears of a "financial crisis."

The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Title: Crypto Banking Gets Green Light From Fed Chair Jerome Powell
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-banking-green-light-fed-chair-powell/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T12:00:28Z

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered remarks yesterday suggesting that US banks can freely engage with crypto clients—provided they understand and manage the inherent risks. Powell’s comments came during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference, where he addressed queries about the Fed’s stance on crypto banking. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they understand and can manage the risks,” Powell said. “We’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because excess risk aversion may be related to regulation and supervision.” Within hours, key figures in the community offered widespread praise for Powell’s statement, interpreting it as a green light for banks that have been hesitant to embrace crypto services. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics.io, commented via X, “Immense tonal shift. OCP2.0 over. this is particularly notable because my understanding is the Fed specifically was the nexus of OCP2.0.” This sentiment was echoed by Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, who tweeted, “Banks will be a major catalyst for crypto in 2025. Mainstream era beginning.” Meanwhile, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, remarked, “Massive wave incoming over next 6-18 months. Most aren’t aware of the scale of it.” Joe Consorti, head of growth at They, underscored the potential breadth of bank offerings: “Banks can custody bitcoin on behalf of clients, create structured bitcoin financial products, and allow customers to buy bitcoin. Even Powell isn’t badmouthing it anymore. Vibe shift.” Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair also signaled the convergence of regulatory and market forces, stating, “FASB + repeal of SAB 121 + In-Kind redemptions for ETFs. Banks are here.” Powell’s comments arrive at a moment when several regulatory and accounting changes are poised to reshape how banks handle digital assets. In August 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a standardized framework for accounting cryptocurrencies on company balance sheets. This was a landmark step, as it establishes clarity on reporting practices—a crucial component for banks considering offering crypto services. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously imposed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in March 2022, requiring financial firms to record customer-held cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. On January 23, 2025, the SEC repealed this rule through SAB 122. This move simplifies the custody process for digital assets, removing a substantial reporting burden and paving the way for more financial institutions to engage in crypto. Moreover, in-kind redemptions for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially Bitcoin ETFs, are set to become a reality under the Trump administration. Instead of using cash, this mechanism allows ETF shares to be exchanged for the underlying assets—aligning smoothly with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and offering potential tax benefits. BlackRock recently applied for a rule change at the SEC for its spot Bitcoin ETF. Taken together, these regulatory evolutions—coupled with Powell’s supportive tone—signal a turning point for banks considering entry into crypto markets. Industry observers suggest that, with obstacles like SAB 121 removed and transparent FASB rules in place, US banks could become leading participants in the next wave of crypto adoption. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.49 trillion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Czech Central Bank Governor To Propose Stunning $7 Billion Bitcoin Reserve Plan
URL: https://zycrypto.com/czech-central-bank-governor-to-propose-stunning-7-billion-bitcoin-reserve-plan/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T11:42:56Z
Full Content:
Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl said in a recent interview that he is set to present a Bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank potentially acquire $7 billion in BTC as part of its diversification strategy. This would make CNB the first central bank to hold the premier crypto. Speaking with Financial Times (FT), Czech central bank chief Aleš Michl revealed that he wants to add billions of dollars worth of the country’s reserves into Bitcoin. Michl will submit a plan to allocate as much as 5% of its €140 billion (or $146 billion) of the bank’s reserves to BTC. For perspective, such a Bitcoin buy would be equivalent to around 5.3 months of newly minted BTC, as noted by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise. Michl acknowledged Bitcoin’s significant volatility and limited track record but noted increased investor appetite since BlackRock and other investment managers listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and President Donald Trump’s campaign promises on crypto deregulation, and the establishment of a national BTC stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told FT, adding that he had a different stance than other central bankers in matters of crypto. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle or the pioneer. I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” President Trump’s return to the White House has bolstered optimism in the crypto industry due to heightened expectations of a more lenient regulatory environment for digital assets. Michl believes Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will potentially light a fire under the bulls, setting up the crypto for a break to new sky-high levels. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The CNB governor further suggested that more central banks around the world could follow his example in the coming five years, but he also cautioned that the investment could end up being worthless. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” The world’s largest crypto briefly hit a record $108,786 just before President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 but has since retraced to $105,251 as of publication time.

New Year’s Eve at Villa Vecchia is a delirious blur of orange and gold, a scene straight out of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s most opulent fantasies. More than 500 people crowd onto the manicured lawns of the century-old Miami Beach estate with its Versailles-inspired ballroom that once welcomed luminaries including Margaret Thatcher, Henry Kissinger and Mikhail Gorbachev. Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000—not the dawn of 2025—is the real raison d’être for the bash. Servers glide around with champagne on silver trays, hors d’oeuvres are stamped with the omnipresent B and dancers in golden bodysuits undulate with glowing orange orbs in homage to bitcoin’s signature hue. At the center of the garden looms a massive playing card, the king’s face replaced with a brazen B. jamel toppin for forbes On the water, the party continues aboard the Usher. The 154-foot superyacht, which was featured in the 2015 film Entourage, glistens against the Miami skyline. A constant stream of shuttles disgorges an unending parade of bitcoin executives, influencers and, most importantly, institutional investors, all decked out in “bitcoin chic” (tangerine suits, B-logo bling). Two giant projectors flash clips forecasting bitcoin’s rise into the millions, while a DJ clad in a space helmet directs bass-heavy tracks between the swaying palms. “I kind of feel a little sick of winning,” quips one reveler in a black cap emblazoned with SATOSHI NAKAMOTO—the handle of bitcoin’s anonymous creator. The partygoers all have crypto cred: The guy in the Nakamoto hat is David Bailey, the 34-year old CEO of BTC Inc., publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, who hosted the Bitcoin Conference in July at which Donald Trump vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a national bitcoin stockpile. Villa Vecchia’s owner and host, Michael Saylor, 59, moves through the revelry clad in his signature black blazer, blue jeans and T-shirt whose front sports (of course) a B. He graciously accepts handshakes and requests for selfies. Here, bitcoin is God—and Saylor is its prophet. Crypto is a second coming of sorts for Saylor, given that he made and lost more than $10 billion during the original dot-com bubble. Back then, MicroStrategy, the Tysons Corner, Virginia–based software firm he cofounded in 1989 fresh out of MIT, was in the data mining and business intelligence software business before running afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices. In 2000, the company paid a fine, settled with the feds and restated its results for the preceding couple years. Forbes For the next two decades MicroStrategy languished with tepid sales and a market cap hovering around $1 billion. That all changed in 2020, when Saylor decided that going all in on bitcoin would be MicroStrategy’s core strategy. Last year, after the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, the crypto­currency’s price skyrocketed, more than doubling over 12 months and breaking through $100,000 in early December. Just before Christmas, Micro­Strategy joined the Nasdaq 100, spurring even more demand for its stock, which is up more than 700% in the last year, as it issued debt and accumulated more bitcoin (it now owns 471,107). Saylor’s company is now the largest holder of the digital asset outside of the elusive Nakamoto, who is said to hold 1 million tokens. During 2024, Saylor’s net worth jumped from $1.9 billion to $7.6 billion. A month into the new year he is worth $9.4 billion. MicroStrategy’s eye-popping gains have stirred up a swarm of critics and short sellers unable to fathom how a tiny software company holding only $48 billion in actual bitcoin could have a market capitalization of $84 billion. But what Saylor’s detractors fail to understand is that Micro­Strategy is brilliantly straddling two realms: one bound by the rules of traditional finance, in which companies issue debt and equity bought and sold by hedge funds, traders and other institutions, and the second governed by the faithful, unwavering believers in a better world brought to you by bitcoin. The fuel propelling MicroStrategy’s success is its embrace and cultivation of volatility, the defining characteristic of its core asset. Volatility is anathema to traditional investors, but it’s a great friend of the options traders, hedge funds and retail speculators that have helped make Micro­Strategy among the most active stocks in the market. With its relatively tiny annual revenue of $496 million, it has a daily trading volume that rivals that of any of the Magnificent 7 tech giants (Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia). “People think that’s crazy,” Saylor says. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? It’s because we put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company, pull capital in and then we spin it. That puts volatility in the equity, and that makes our options and convertible bonds the most interesting and highest-performing in the market.” Michael Saylor is 100 percent correct when it comes to the desirability of the $7.3 billion in convertible bonds his company has issued since 2021. Every minute of the trading day, MicroStrategy’s stock price is being amplified in real time by bitcoin’s constant gyrations, increasing what’s known as the implied volatility of the call option inherent in its convertible bonds. That’s because unlike straight bonds, convertibles give debt holders safety, with the option of exchanging their notes for Micro­Strategy stock at predetermined prices until maturity. Every trader schooled in the Black-Scholes options pricing formula knows that high implied volatility increases the value of an option. Thus Saylor has been able to issue his convertible debt at almost no interest cost. So far MicroStrategy’s six convertible notes, issued with maturities from 2027 to 2032, have interest rates ranging from 0% to 2.25%. In public bond markets, where liquidity has been shrinking thanks to the boom in private credit, institutional investors are starving for excess returns. MicroStrategy’s bonds not only represent one of the only ways big investors like German insurer Allianz and State Street can invest in digital assets, but they’ve also been one of the market’s top performers, clocking returns in excess of 250% since issuance. Even the $3 billion five-year notes MicroStrategy issued in November, with their 0% coupon and strike price of $672 (80% above MicroStrategy’s current share price) are up 89% in just a few months. Saylor understands that institutional investors, who are measured against quarterly benchmarks, will keep buying his high-octane paper to boost their portfolio returns. Issuing huge amounts of convertible bonds, as MicroStrategy has, is normally dilutive for a company’s stock, but in this case it has had a bullish effect because the notes represent future stock demand at increasingly higher prices. Through secondary offerings and convertible issuance, MicroStrategy’s outstanding shares have grown since 2020 from 97 million to 246 million. Over the same period, its stock has appreciated 2,666%. In late January, its shareholders voted to vastly increase the company’s authorized shares to 10.3 billion. The cycle feeds itself: Issue billions in low- or no-cost debt and equity, drive bitcoin pri­ces higher with large purchases and catapult MicroStrategy’s hyper­volatile stock. Rinse and repeat. “What they found is a monetary glitch in the financial markets that they’re taking advantage of,” marvels Richard Byworth, former conver­tible bonds trader at Nomura and managing partner at Zurich, Switzerland–based alternative investment firm Syz Capital. Saylor is understandably unabashed in his hyping of bitcoin. Last August he invented an entirely new financial metric dubbed Bitcoin Yield or BTC Yield. This sort of “yield” has nothing to do with any income being generated but simply measures the percentage change in the ratio of the company’s bitcoin holdings to the company’s fully diluted shares over time. His initial targets for the measure were 4% to 8% growth annually, but in January MicroStrategy reported a BTC Yield of 48% for Q4 and 74.3% for all of 2024—big but meaningless numbers he has fed like chum to his adoring followers. Try to put a value on MicroStrategy the old-fashioned way and you’ll lose your marbles, according to Ben Werkman, a former commercial banker, consultant and early investor in the company’s bitcoin strategy. Saylor “turned off the income statement thinking and said ‘We’re going to attack the net worth side of the company, focus on leveraging the strength that we have on our balance sheet,’ and in this case, that means acquiring more bitcoin.” Which is exactly what MicroStrategy is doing. In October, Saylor unveiled a plan called “21/21” to raise a whopping $42 billion—half through equity, half through debt—over the next three years to buy more bitcoin. In November and December alone, the firm scooped up nearly 200,000 coins worth roughly $18 billion. It all works out brilliantly as long as the price of bitcoin keeps rising, but what if it collapses, as it has many times before? “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. MicroStrategy is singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market.” Unless it’s a true apocalypse, MicroStrategy should be okay. Bitcoin would need to fall by more than 80% from its current $100,000-plus level and stay that way for at least two years for Micro­Strategy to fall short on its ability to cover its current debt obligations. Here again Saylor has shown genius in exploiting the capital markets and the behavior of bond investors. All of the $7 billion in debt MicroStrategy has issued is unsecured and not technically backed by any of the bitcoin in its coffers. Moreover, at the company’s current stock price of $373, more than $4 billion of its debt is already “in the money” or, effectively, equity. “Actually, there is very little debt on Micro­Strategy’s balance sheet,” says Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, a San Francisco–based crypto asset manager, noting that a forced liquidation of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings would be unlikely because institutional bondholders have high tolerance for refinancings, even in worst-case bankruptcy scenarios. What is stopping other companies from copying Saylor’s bitcoin-fueled financial engineering? Nothing. And many are starting to do exactly that. According to Park, Bitwise counts about 90 public companies, including well-known names Tesla and Block, that have added bitcoin to their balance sheets. In March, his company will launch the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which will be a bitcoin holdings-weighted index of 35 public companies in possession of at least 1,000 bitcoin (roughly $100 million) in their treasuries. MicroStrategy will domi­nate the index. The copycats are giving ammunition to Micro­Strategy haters. “The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” according to Kerrisdale Capital, a Miami-based investment firm that issued a short thesis on the stock in March. But Park argues that like Netflix in streaming, Micro­Strategy’s first-mover advantage and size set it apart. “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. They are singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market,” Park says. “The options market for Micro­Strategy is by far the deepest single name options market in the entire world.” MicroStrategy’s frenetic options have even spawned a fund called YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, which sells call options to generate income. The year-old fund has an annual yield of 106% and has already amassed $1.9 billion in assets. Sitting by the pool at Villa Vecchia, with his crypto-named parrots Hodl, Satoshi and Max chattering away in the background, Saylor waves off his critics. “Conventional wisdom in business for the last 40 years was that capital is a liability and volatility is bad. The bitcoin standard dictates capital is an asset and volatility is good—it’s a feature,” he insists. “They’re living in flatland, a pre-Copernican world. We’re on a train going 60 miles an hour, spinning a gyro with a 30-ton weight on it, and the rest of the world is standing by the side of the track, stationary.” This isn’t the first time Michael Saylor has flown close to the sun. He was born in 1965 on an Air Force base in Lincoln, Nebraska, and his early years were steeped in military discipline. His father, a chief master sergeant, moved the family between Air Force bases around the world before settling near Wright-Patterson in Ohio—home of the Wright Brothers’ aviation school—where Saylor gradua­ted high school as valedictorian and class marshal, voted “most likely to succeed” by his peers. He went on to study aeronautics and astronautics at MIT on a full Air Force ROTC scholarship and wrote a thesis on a computer simulation of a Renaissance Italian city-state. In his free time, he played guitar in a rock band and flew gliders. He graduated in 1987 with highest honors and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force, but his dream of becoming a fighter pilot was grounded by a heart murmur, which turned out to be a misdiagnosis. At age 24, he cofounded MicroStrategy with his MIT fraternity brother Sanju Bansal. The company tapped into data analytics at a time when few understood that discipline’s potential. Riding the dot-com wave, the company went public in 1998, and by 2000, its market cap soared past $24 billion. With his net worth rising to a peak of nearly $14 billion, Saylor became a tech evangelist heralding a world in which data would flow “like water.” “We’re going to use our technology to obliterate entire supply chains,” Saylor told Forbes in late 1998. “We’re playing for all the marbles to essentially win the entire industry worldwide, forever.” Then came the crash. On March 10, 2000, Micro­Strategy’s stock hit a peak of $313 per share—more than 60 times its IPO price. Within two weeks it plummeted to $72, following the company’s announcement that it would need to restate its financial results. The SEC accused Saylor and others of accounting fraud, charges MicroStrategy later settled for $11 million. Within two years its stock price had fallen below $1. Saylor’s $13 billion fortune evaporated. “It was the darkest part of my life,” he says. “When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst.” In 2020, after the government followed years of quantitative easing with trillions of dollars in Covid-19-related stimulus, Saylor became convinced that the best use for the remaining $530 million in cash and short-term investments on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet was investing in bitcoin. The U.S. government could print as many dollars as it wanted—and it was hard at work doing just that—but, by design, bitcoin comes with a hard cap: There will never be more than 21 million in existence. If the price of bitcoin plummets, MicroStrategy’s stock will fall harder and faster than the token itself. But be careful about dismissing Saylor as yet another too-smart-for-his-own good entrepreneur gone off the rails. Many others are following the lead of MicroStrategy—which now bills itself “the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury.” Some public companies, like Metaplanet, owe their very survival to bitcoin. The Tokyo-based hotel chain faced an existential crisis during the pandemic when Japan closed its borders to tourists. The small hotelier sold all but one of its ten properties and issued shares and debt to finance $70 million in bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet’s shares, which trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and over the counter, gained 2,600% in 2024, and its market capitalization is now $1 billion, despite holding only $183 million worth of bitcoin. The company’s homepage now reads “Secure the Future with Bitcoin” and barely mentions hotels. “We owe a lot to Michael Saylor for the business plan, which he has created for the rest of the world to follow,” says Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet and a guest at Saylor’s New Year’s bash. “I invented 20 things, tried to make them successful and really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared. It’s made me more successful than every one of my ideas.” It is unlikely many corporations will go to Metaplanet’s extreme, but more bitcoin converts are almost a certainty. In January, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changed a rule that previously permitted companies to record crypto value declines only as losses in quarterly reports, so that now holdings will be marked to market, allowing for reversal of losses and gains as well. For MicroStrategy, which lobbied for the change, it’s likely to mean numerous profitable quarters ahead—and possible inclusion in the S&P 500. Today hundreds of sizable public companies around the world are sitting on more than twice the cash they need to finance current operations and liabilities, according to data from YCharts. Most prominent among them is Berkshire Hathaway, which currently holds $320 billion in cash. Given the $35 trillion (and growing) national debt, Saylor’s mantra has long been “cash is trash.” “Financial repression is an eternal phenomenon,” insists Bitwise’s Park, referring to the inevitability of government-induced lower interest rates. “We are living in this hyper-financialized world where the real economy has fundamentally detached itself from the financial economy. You actually can’t service the level of debt without printing more money, and if you believe you have to continue printing more money, then you better believe there’s going to be yield curve repression.” For Saylor, Villa Vecchia itself is Exhibit A. The 18,000-square-foot mansion on Miami’s “Millionaire’s Row” was built for the president of F.W. Woolworth in 1928; Saylor bought it for $13 million in 2012. This house “was $100,000 in 1930. It was appraised at $46 million a few years ago,” said Saylor during a 2023 podcast interview. “Do the calculation—it’s on a path to be worth $100 million, which means that the U.S. dollar will have lost 99.9% of its value over 100 years. The bottom line is: Your money in the bank isn’t money.” The coming Trump years are likely to be good for MicroStrategy and bitcoin. Despite all his bluster about “government efficiency,” Trump was a huge spendthrift during his first presidency: In the four years of Trump 1.0, the national debt increased by $8.4 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And although he famously called bitcoin a “scam” competing against the dollar in 2021, Trump is all in on crypto these days. In fact, his son Eric recently posted a picture with Saylor at Mar-a-Lago captioned “Two friends, one passion: bitcoin.” Not only is the value of the dollar likely to further erode over the next four years, but Saylor’s relentless proselytizing aligns perfectly with the dystopian MAGA worldview. “The human condition has been plagued by dirt: toxic food, toxic liquid, and the economic condition of the human race has been plagued by toxic capital. I’m on a mission to evangelize nontoxic capital for the world,” he preaches. But even Michael Saylor occasionally steps down from his soapbox to reflect on his corporate journey. “We adopted bitcoin out of frustration and desperation, and then it became an opportunity, and then it became a strategy, and then it became an identity, and then it became a mission,” he says. “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” And a reminder that lightning can indeed strike the same place twice, especially when there is a shrewd and opportunistic steward at the helm.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities Amid DeepSeek Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First American Financial Corporation (NYSE:FAF) stands against other non-tech AI opportunities amid DeepSeek selloff. Investors are searching for safer ways to capitalize on the AI boom beyond traditional tech stocks. Towards the back end of last year, Goldman Sachs highlighted sectors such as utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare as key beneficiaries of AI-driven productivity gains and cost reductions. While companies like NVIDIA have surged in value due to their role in AI hardware, Goldman analysts suggest the market has yet to fully recognize the potential of downstream AI-exposed industries. David Kostin, Goldman’s chief US equity strategist, outlines four phases of the AI boom. The first phase revolves around NVIDIA and AI chipmakers, while the second phase focuses on AI infrastructure, including semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security firms. These stocks have significantly outperformed market benchmarks in 2024. The third phase will involve companies integrating AI into their products to drive revenue growth. While these firms have lagged behind pure AI plays, their time is expected to come. The fourth phase includes businesses that will realize long-term productivity gains from AI adoption. Currently overlooked by the market, these companies are expected to see valuation expansions over time. The industrial sector exemplifies this trend. Since early 2023, industrial stocks have gained nearly 30%, with AI-exposed firms more than doubling in value. In Q4 2023, AI mentions in industrial earnings reports rose from 10% to over 30%. Goldman Sachs anticipates these trends will continue, with downstream AI stocks eventually rallying as their AI-driven efficiencies translate into earnings growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. As the sudden popularity of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek ignites a tech selloff in the US stock market, investors are closely monitoring the non-tech AI opportunities that hold explosive growth potential. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs released an investor note detailing some of the non-tech beneficiaries of the AI boom. Per the bank, the rise of AI-driven data centers was fueling a massive increase in electricity demand, with power needs expected to grow by over 160% by 2030. Nuclear energy is poised to play a critical role in meeting this demand, but it won’t be the sole solution. Natural gas, renewables, and battery storage will also be essential, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The report notes that big tech companies have already signed contracts for over 10 GW of potential new nuclear capacity in the US, with three nuclear plants possibly coming online by 2030. Globally, governments are becoming more supportive of nuclear power, with the COP28 summit setting a goal to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050. However, challenges such as labor shortages, permitting difficulties, and uranium supply constraints may slow progress, the report warned. Renewables will also be a major part of the energy mix, with 40% of new capacity expected to come from wind and solar. However, their intermittent nature means they must be paired with battery storage and baseload sources like nuclear or natural gas. Despite lower energy costs for renewables, transmission and storage limitations pose challenges.

For this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A modern office tower overlooking a city skyline, illustrating the power of its financial services division. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 First American Financial Corporation (NYSE:FAF) provides financial services. There are numerous reasons why investing in this company is worthwhile. The report for the third quarter of 2024 shows the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders through share repurchases while managing earnings performance. For instance, the adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.34 suggests the company’s underlying profitability remains strong. Moreover, First American Financial (NYSE:FAF) repurchased 293,155 shares for a total of $16 million at an average price of $54.96. In addition, the company and Simplex 3D have launched a cutting-edge 3D platform for real estate professionals with data-rich visualizations of New York City and the Greater Metro Area. This initiative reflects the company’s commitment to leveraging AI and advanced technologies to deliver innovative solutions to its clients. Overall, FAF ranks 33rd on our list of non-tech AI opportunities amid DeepSeek selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of FAF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than FAF but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: No More Bitcoin Bear Markets Ever? Fund CIO Explores New Market Reality
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/no-more-bitcoin-bear-market-fund-cio/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T07:45:19Z
Full Content:
In a new investor note published on January 29, 2025, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, questioned whether the historical four-year market cycle of Bitcoin could finally be coming to an end. His reasoning is rooted in seismic shifts in US policy toward crypto, highlighted by a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at solidifying the nation’s leadership in digital assets. Hougan’s note begins with an explanation of the so-called “four-year cycle,” where Bitcoin has typically seen three years of substantial gains followed by a pullback. This cycle, he explains, mirrors broader boom-bust patterns in traditional markets:“The four-year cycle in crypto is driven by the same forces that drive broader cycles of growth and recession in the general economy,” he wrote. These expansions, fueled by technological breakthroughs or increased investor interest, often lead to over-leverage, occasionally resulting in fraud or industry-wide strain. Eventually, something “breaks” and triggers a market correction—such as the 2014 Mt. Gox collapse or the 2018 SEC crackdown on ICOs. Hougan describes the current crypto upswing as the “Mainstream Cycle,” emerging out of 2022’s “massive deleveraging” caused by failures like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and others. According to him, the latest bull phase took off in March 2023, when Grayscale convincingly “won the opening argument” in its legal challenge against the SEC over a spot Bitcoin ETF. “Bitcoin was trading at $22,218 when Grayscale mounted its argument. It’s trading at $102,674 today. The mainstream era has arrived.” Once a spot Bitcoin ETF was approved and launched in January 2024, investor inflows surged, further cementing Bitcoin’s acceptance among both retail and institutional players. The most striking component of Hougan’s analysis is his examination of last week’s executive order issued by President Trump. The order not only deemed the development of the US digital asset ecosystem a “national priority,” but it also set in motion a clearer regulatory framework for crypto. “Last week, President Trump issued an executive order that was so overwhelmingly bullish for the space that it’s making me wonder,” Hougan wrote, noting how the document outlines plans for a potential “national crypto stockpile” and encourages banks and financial institutions to accelerate their adoption of digital assets. Combined with a now more welcoming stance from the SEC, Hougan believes these measures could unleash trillions in new investment over the coming years, far surpassing the hundreds of billions that an ETF-driven market was already expected to generate. Hougan’s analysis acknowledges that Bitcoin has historically followed its pattern of eventual pullbacks after surging bull runs. But with Wall Street behemoths and major banks preparing to integrate crypto at every level, there’s a growing possibility that the market may not face the traditional plunge in 2026: “If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new ‘crypto winter’ in 2026?” he posited. “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While he concedes that leverage continues to build in the system—citing an uptick in Bitcoin-backed lending programs, derivatives, and levered exchange-traded products—he also highlights an increasingly diverse pool of crypto investors. This diversity, he argues, could dampen severe drawdowns. “My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis,” Hougan argued. However, Hougan expects that any future market correction will be “shorter and shallower” than previous cycles. With the industry’s infrastructure now significantly more robust and mainstream participants treating crypto as a legitimate asset class, a dramatic bear market akin to those of 2014 or 2018 may be less likely. “As for now, it’s full steam ahead,” he concluded. “The crypto train is leaving the station.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,275.

Title: Festivals in Ireland 2025: From Longitude to All Together Now - a guide to 80 of the best

From heavy hitters such as Electric Picnic and Dublin Theatre Festival to more esoteric gatherings, the Irish festival calendar has something for everyone. The list below offers just a taste of the cultural showcases coming up in 2025. Lots of festivals won’t announce their programmes until later in the year, so keep an eye on their websites and social media. The Chinese Year of the Snake symbolises wisdom, transformation and resilience. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they are symbols of rebirth, immortality and healing. The Lunar New Year celebrations culminate on Sunday, February 2nd, with the festival’s flagship event, a day of festivities in Meeting House Square. Classics NowJanuary 31st-February 2nd, Dublin, classicsnow.ieThis year’s festival, which includes talks, dance, drama and film, features the novelists Pat Barker and Ferdia Lennon, the classicist Edith Hall, the dramatist Gavin Kostick, the dance-theatre artist Luke Murphy and the Jordanian playwright Raphaël Khouri. The fourth Brigit: Dublin City Celebrating Women festival features more than 80 events. Honouring the Celtic goddess Brigid, who embodies inspiration, healing, magic, smithcraft, wisdom, poetry, protection, fire and earth, it showcases women’s contributions, past and present, with a citywide programme spotlighting women’s stories, underscoring their impact on society and heralding the arrival of spring. Celebrate St Brigid’s legacy with a star-studded line-up of Irish talent, intimate concerts, cultural events and family activities across Kildare. More than 470 young players from across Ireland take to the stage of the National Concert Hall to perform classical works and modern arrangements at this family-friendly event. Eleven days of Irish and international cinema, featuring red-carpet premieres, masterclasses from Oscar-winning directors, and the best of global storytelling on the big screen. The festival began in 1984 as the Kate O’Brien Weekend, to celebrate the writer. The name changed in 2015 to broaden the reach of the festival, which is run by readers for readers. The main speaker at this year’s festival is the economist and Irish Times columnist David McWilliams. Look out for a Heaney in Translation event, introduced by Niall MacMonagle and featuring John McIntyre, Zoe Conway and Eleanor Methven. Venues around the city will host world-class musicians at seven intimate concerts of repertoire from Mozart to Brahms, plus world premieres. Festival highlights include a night at Blackrock Castle and a classical-trad fusion concert at Dripsey Castle. A packed programme of international and local performances and events for children and their adults. Now in its eighth year, this festival celebrates music by women across eras and genres – classical, contemporary, jazz and traditional – with four days of top Irish and international performers at venues around Clonmel.

Title: Elegant Victorian with showstopper potential on Donnybrook’s Marlborough Road for €1.95m

In their lifetime, many of the large Victorian properties on Marlborough Road in Donnybrook have transitioned from family homes to flats and back again. Number 102, which was built in 1856, falls somewhere in between. It has been owned by the same family for several years, and has been adapted over time for different life stages. While it is not set out in self-contained units per se, separate living spaces have been created inside the two-storey over-basement redbrick. With a floor area of 285sq m (3,067sq ft) and a total of six bedrooms, the Dublin 4 property is in good condition, with many original features intact and well-maintained. It is on the market through Mullery O’Gara with an asking price of €1.95 million. Marlborough Road is a long, tree-lined street in Dublin 4 with Morehampton Road at one end and Sandford Road at the other, effectively connecting Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. Most homes along the road that were converted into flats in years gone by have now been returned to family homes. Taking number 102 back to a family home in its entirety would not require too much work. The house has not been carved out into individual flats, so new owners could move in following a little reconfiguring. The granite steps lead up to the main entrance, with the Victorian architecture evident from the minute you walk into the hallway. The ornate coving, detailed architraves and original stained-glass window have all been restored and showcased. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] To the left is the drawingroom, which has not lost any of its grandeur during the property’s many guises, with high ceilings, sash windows and the original granite fireplace remaining the standout features. Straight ahead is a study with a long sash window looking out over the rear garden. Beside this is a less formal reception room with a beautiful marble fireplace. The independent living spaces are downstairs at garden level. There is a separate entrance to this floor that has two bedrooms with their own bathrooms and living areas with kitchenette. If new owners wished to turn this house back to a cohesive home, this level would probably be where they would house the kitchen with access to the garden. With the 32m-long south-facing garden, extending further out would be an option, subject to planning permission. There are many homes on the road that have done exactly this, so a quick knock into the neighbours may provide some design inspiration. Out front, there is parking for several cars in the gravel driveway. Although the road can get busy, particularly with school runs in the morning, the house is set back enough for the passing cars to go more or less unnoticed. Upstairs on the first floor there are four bedrooms, each with a cast-iron fireplace. There is also a shower room and separate WC that would benefit from an upgrade. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] There is so much potential at number 102 to create a home that will grow with a family, from toddlers needing room to play to young adults looking for a bit of independence within the home. The property is Ber-exempt, but as it currently uses electric storage heaters, new owners will probably want to investigate retrofitting. Recent sales on the road include number 59, which sold last summer for more than €1.515 million, according to the Property Price Register. This was a midterrace two-storey-over-basement property that was set out in flats and in need of renovation. Number 75 sold for €1.925 million last September. It was also midterrace and smaller than number 102, but restored to a high level. Interest in Marlborough Road is not just for the fine houses. The location in Dublin 4 is a huge pull when it comes to potential buyers. The street may feel exclusive and private, yet it is only 3km from St Stephen’s Green. For families with children of school-going age, Muckross Park College is on the road, while Sandford Park and Gonzaga are just across the way. Herbert Park is a short walk away, as are Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. At weekends and on long summer evenings, the kids can turn left and be at Scoop in Ranelagh for a gelato in five minutes, while the adults can turn right and enjoy the short walk to Donnybrook Fair for a more sophisticated treat.

Title: Upgraded and extended home in Clonskeagh for €1.25m

Number 2 Beechmount Drive was a very different house in 2015. When the current owners bought the property 10 years ago, it had been lived in by two friends. The friends divided the house in two so they could both have their own living spaces, which resulted in a house that had two of everything, from doorbells to bathrooms. It has since undergone a complete renovation, with not much left of the original house, bar the door frame and the external walls at the front. The ground floor was extended, and the garage was converted, with extra accommodation added above it. With a floor area of 205sq m (2,207sq ft), the semidetached home is on the market through DNG, seeking €1.25m. The new layout downstairs caters for every situation. At the back is a large open-plan kitchen with units by Glenwise in Kimmage. There is enough room for a living area and dining area, which is ideal when entertaining. Through sliding pocket doors is a cosy TV room with bespoke storage units, also making it a good option for a playroom. At the front of the house is a livingroom with solid-fuel stove and an office on the other side of the hallway. There is also a guest loo and utility room on the ground floor. Upstairs there are three double bedrooms. The original box room was taken out and used as an en suite and dressingroom for the main bedroom, as well as to make room for a staircase up to the converted attic. The main bathroom has a separate bath and shower, and the attic has also been plumbed, so new owners could add another bathroom. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] The house was renovated with a view that the owners would stay forever, so they put the best of everything into it. There are small things in the house that will make a big difference to daily life such as the laundry chute in the hot press upstairs that goes down to the utility room, and the charging drawer in the kitchen where you can plug in your devices. The Ber rating was brought up to an impressive B2 following the renovations, which included high levels of insulation, the installation of underfloor heating on the ground floor as well as solar panels on the roof that heat the water. An electric car charging point has also been fitted in the front driveway. Double doors from the kitchen open out to a patio, which steps down to the lawn of the 40m garden. The mature trees in neighbouring gardens create a real sense of privacy when out in the east-facing garden. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] The area is very popular with families as it has schools, parks, playgrounds, UCD and cafes. Windy Arbour Luas stop is a five-minute walk away. The bus stop around the corner from the house on Bird Avenue is served by the new S4 bus route that runs from UCD to Liffey Valley, as well as the 142, which starts in Portmarnock and ends at UCD. When the owners completed the project on their home on Beechmount Drive, they thought they would never leave. Their heads have been turned by another house in need of renovation, however, so they feel the time is right to get their hands dirty once again.

Title: Chasing the Don: How EU politicians are jockeying for position with Trump

From Nigel Farage to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, here are the competitors for the position of Europe's Trump whisperer. By NICHOLAS VINOCUR and JACOPO BARIGAZZI AI generated Text-to-speech Europe has discovered a new competitive sport: jockeying to get close to United States President Donald Trump. The first high-stakes interaction seemed to go badly. The fiery phone call between Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was so alarming that she promptly set off on a European tour to shore up support in Berlin, Brussels and Paris against America seizing Greenland. For other leaders, the big fear is that the newly installed president could impose punishing tariffs. But will he actually listen? Is there anyone in Brussels or elsewhere in Europe who really has his ear? European politicians are lining up to explain why they should be the ones to “interpret” the bloc’s thorny politics to the U.S. president. The invitation list for his inauguration, however, suggested the Trump camp was closer to several far-right politicians than mainstream national leaders. In an attempt to shed light on who stands where in Trump’s international pecking order, POLITICO has put together a guide to the key aspiring “Trump whisperers” in Europe and ranked them on their “Trump-compatibility.” Here we go: When it comes to currying favor with Trump, Italy’s right-wing prime minister is at the front of the line. Before she became the only European Union leader to be invited to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni met with the Republican leader during a huddle facilitated by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the reopening of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in December. Then there was a private huddle earlier this month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, following which he called Meloni “a fantastic woman” and gave her a domestic win by helping her negotiate a hostage release in Iran. Trump’s willingness to meet Meloni face-to-face puts her in a league of her own in terms of access compared to other European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron or German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Significantly, Meloni’s foreign minister is one of only four EU ministers to have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio since Jan. 20. That said, it remains to be seen just how deep Meloni’s connection goes. She also maintained close ties with the administration of previous U.S. President Joe Biden before Trump’s election victory, a point that may be held against her by Trump’s MAGA entourage. Another black mark: Italy’s defense spending, which is below 2 percent of gross domestic product and will shrink in 2025, is far from Trump’s desired goal of 5 percent of GDP for European countries. Finally, Meloni’s coziness with Musk could become a disadvantage if the tech mogul suddenly loses sway with Trump. But what look like drawbacks may well help Meloni in the end, argues Beniamino Irdi, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. Low defense spending “puts her in the unique position of being perhaps the only one amongst the bad players [like Spain or Belgium] who speaks the same language as Trump. And she has a very big stake in trying to valorize this affinity,” he said. — By Hannah Roberts Trump compatibility score: Hungary’s strongman leader is another contender for the position of Trump’s “chief whisperer” in Europe. The illiberal ruler of Hungary bagged not one but two invitations to Mar-a-Lago in 2024, and has been effusive in his praise of the MAGA leader for years. Trump has returned the favor by repeatedly name-checking Orbán in his speeches, even calling him a “great man.” There are also extensive contacts between Trump allies in Washington and Orbán’s friends in Budapest, who contributed to the “Project 2025” plan for Trump’s second term prepared by the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank. However, Orbán’s pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies may put a serious damper on his popularity with Trump in office. While Trump threatens sanctions against Russia to force it to stop its war against Ukraine, Hungary has stood in the way, this week threatening to block the rollover of EU sanctions against Moscow. Orbán has also gone out of his way to court Chinese business interests, inviting Beijing-backed corporations to build railways and electric vehicle factories in his country. What’s more, the prime minister has publicly pushed back on Trump’s request that EU countries spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense. At this stage, even the Hungarians are hedging about their Trump-compatibility. “The question of becoming a bridge between the U.S. administration and the EU is relevant only if the U.S. administration is looking for such a bridge, which cannot be taken for granted,” said János Bóka, Hungary’s EU affairs minister. Hungary doesn’t “pretend to speak on behalf of the European Union, and we don’t pretend to have a mandate to negotiate or to facilitate any agreement between the European Union and the United States,” he told a small group of journalists last week. Move to the back of the line, Viktor. — By Jacopo Barigazzi Trump compatibility score: These Polish right-wingers are as MAGA-compatible as it gets. Speaking to POLITICO in December, Morawiecki said that together with Italian Prime Minister Meloni, he would be “an ideal intermediary between the United States and Europe.” That must have pleased some people close to Trump because Morawiecki, along with other hard-right EU politicians, scored an invitation to the inauguration. To prove his loyalty, Morawiecki posted a picture of himself in front of Trump and Vice President JD Vance, writing that a “wind of change” was blowing “faster and faster toward Poland.” Duda, for his part, is among the European leaders Trump knows best after meeting him several times during his first term. (That said, Duda is leaving office in May, and Trump didn’t have any time to spare for him in September when he abruptly canceled a planned meeting.) For now, Poland’s MAGA allies are playing second fiddle to Meloni, even though Warsaw is doing far better than Rome in terms of defense spending. The big question now is whether one of Duda and Morawiecki’s allies will win a presidential election in May. If Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by their Law and Justice party, becomes Polish president, the bridge to Trump may be preserved. If not, that privilege will likely be lost to Poland’s current prime minister, Donald Tusk. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: The Brexiteer-in-chief has long boasted of his friendship with Trump, celebrating the latter’s win on election night in Mar-a-Lago and joining the inauguration glitz as part of a cast of global right-wingers. He has even talked up the idea he would do a better job as U.S. ambassador than Britain’s actual pick — and Trump has returned the favor by praising him as a “handsome” man after his own image. The pair’s politics are firmly aligned, and Farage has long plied the same smash-the-establishment message as Trump as he tries to unsettle Britain’s Labour government. Yet it’s not all sweetness and light: The Reform UK leader has found himself decidedly out of favor of late with Trump’s right hand man, Musk, with the pair clashing over Musk’s backing of a jailed British far-right agitator deemed too extreme for Farage. Add to that the fact that Farage isn’t a head of state or government and comes from an island nation that has commanded steadily less of Trump’s attention. — By Matt Honeycombe-Foster Trump compatibility score: The French far-right flamethrower’s relationship with Trump dates back to at least 2022, when Éric Zemmour let it be known that he was getting political advice from the man who would become the 47th president of the United States. The revelation came as something of a surprise. Though Zemmour had modeled his presidential campaign on Trump’s, embracing the role of a culture warrior unafraid to create buzz by being controversial, the then-ex president’s reputation was at its lowest. At the time, a Trump return to the White House seemed a pipe dream after a second impeachment, making the idea of the French commentator-turned-presidential-candidate’s aligning himself with a disgraced leader seem foolish. Zemmour’s campaign eventually petered out, and so did his political relevance. So it came as a surprise when POLITICO discovered that Zemmour and his political and romantic partner, member of the European Parliament Sarah Knafo, had got their hands on tickets to the inauguration. In terms of politics, Trump and Zemmour aren’t a perfect fit, as Trump’s protectionist economic beliefs align better with Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement, the National Rally, than with those of Zemmour’s party, Reconquest. But Trump has made it clear he values loyalty and respect, and it was Zemmour who reached out during the president’s darkest days. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: A teacher by trade who embodies plucky bonhomie, Rutte isn’t the most obvious sparring partner for Trump. But thanks to his lengthy leadership experience in the Netherlands, where he was prime minister for 14 years, and his current big job at NATO, Mark Rutte may be at the front of the line when it comes to whispering in POTUS’s ear. Quite simply, Rutte is the man Trump is relying on to force Europeans to start spending more on defense. The Dutchman has taken to this role with relish, telling locals that Donald is “right” when it comes to Europeans taking more responsibility for their own defense, and warning them that Russia may be knocking on their doors next if they fail to step up. He’s also one of the few Europeans to have been invited to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. To be sure, Trump held back on praising Rutte after their meeting. The Dutchman is also a lifelong centrist and doesn’t share any obvious ideological similarities with Trump. But Rutte, like Trump, is a dealmaker who has something to offer. And that could prove more valuable in the long run than political alignment. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: This pairing isn’t a natural fit for Trump. As former head of the European Council (an institution Trump has taken to ignoring) and an opponent of the Law and Justice party, Donald Tusk is at odds with Trump’s natural hard-right allies in Poland (see above). Meanwhile, Radosław Sikorski is an Atlanticist whose wife, The Atlantic writer Anne Applebaum, is a prominent Trump critic. However, as with Rutte, Trump’s need to engage with key defensive players in Europe means the U.S. president may look beyond any ideological difference and end up having more to do with this pair than with other EU leaders. Indeed, Sikorski was one of the first European foreign ministers to speak to Marco Rubio following his confirmation as secretary of state. It helps that Poland is on course to meet Trump’s defense spending target of 5 percent of GDP before any other European country, making Warsaw “top of the class” in Washington’s eyes. Some commentators have latched on to this fact, dubbing Tusk the “most likely to become Trump’s whisperer” in Europe. What could spoil the party, however, is if Law and Justice candidate Nawrocki becomes Polish president in an upcoming election. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: Friedrich Merz’s connection with Trump is all about power and position. Put simply, Merz is on course to become leader of Europe’s top economy, which would make him a natural counterpart for the U.S. president. Merz himself has recognized this role, saying in an interview last week that “Germany must take on a leading role” in negotiations with Trump. This could happen, he has said, if Germany bought F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. but maintained them at home, building any necessary factories: “That would be a good deal for both sides,” he claimed. The conservative heavyweight’s confidence seems to flow mostly from his business background. Merz is a corporate lawyer by trade who has spent most of the past two decades quietly stewing while sitting on company boards — including at BlackRock — and making a small fortune. He’s also known for bashing the progressive left for its gender debates while talking up his anti-immigration credentials. Remarkably, he has been spared from the attacks of Musk, who has referred to the incumbent center-left chancellor, Scholz, as “a fool,” while endorsing far-right German politician Alice Weidel. Whether Merz will be capable of turning the page when it comes to dealing with Trump remains questionable. Trump notoriously detested former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and while Merz tried to approach Trump via a handwritten letter congratulating him on his inauguration, there has been no known contact between the two men. That said, Trump likes power. And as of Feb. 24, Merz may well be Europe’s most powerful politician. — By Nette Nöstlinger Trump compatibility score: The French president is giving Trump a dose of “je t’aime, moi non plus.” (“I love you, me neither,” the title of an old Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot song.) After rushing to congratulate Trump on his election victory in November, Emmanuel Macron also warned that Europe needs to start flexing its muscles if it wants to earn the respect of the new U.S. president. Macron was not present at Trump’s inauguration, nor did he receive an official invitation, according to French diplomats. But insiders point to Trump’s decision to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral as a sign of Macron’s influence with the new U.S. administration. It was on the sidelines of that visit that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Macron’s tough-love approach might work with the Donald, who clearly appeared to enjoy knuckle-crunching handshakes with the French president in his first mandate (these handshake battles have also resumed). Trump has called Macron a “very nice guy” but also a “wise guy,” and loves to boast that he got Macron to fold in an escalating trade war with France. But with Trump putting even more emphasis on allegiance in his second mandate, it’s unlikely Macron has the right recipe to get through to him. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: This trio is at the top of the food chain when it comes to power in the EU institutions. For Trump, however, they’re at the bottom of the pile of preferred foreign partners. Commenting on Trump’s preference for engaging with national leaders rather than with the EU, one EU diplomat said: “He’s clearly shown that he wants to do bilateral relations. This may be a negotiating tactic, as he knows he will have to deal with the EU on trade, but it’s potentially problematic.” Indeed, in the face of Trump’s cold shoulder, top EU representatives are trying out two — seemingly contradictory — strategies. The first is to signal openness to engage with Trump, and Kaja Kallas invited his top diplomat to attend a high-level European gathering. The second is to signal to Trump that Europe has relationships with other powerful countries around the world, as Ursula von der Leyen did in a recent speech in Davos, Switzerland, where she touted EU relations with India and Latin America over the United States. At the end of the day, Trump will have to speak to the EU. But the first days of his presidency have made it clear where he places the bloc on his list of priorities: Way down at the bottom. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score:

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.

Title: Robinhood CEO warns US risks losing financial edge without tokenization clarity

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev warned that the US could lose its competitive edge in financial markets if regulators fail to provide clear rules for tokenized securities. In a Jan. 28 op-ed for The Washington Post, Tenev argued that blockchain-based financial assets could broaden investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to participate in the early growth of high-profile private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe. He highlighted that these firms have increasingly avoided public markets, limiting investment access to only the wealthiest individuals and widening the gap between institutional and retail investors. According to Tenev: “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind. It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” Tenev outlined a path for regulators to integrate tokenized securities into the financial system, proposing a security token registration framework as an alternative to traditional IPOs. He argued that companies should have a regulated option to issue tokenized equity, which would provide retail investors with early access to high-growth firms while maintaining proper disclosures and investor protections. Additionally, he called for clear guidelines that would allow exchanges and broker-dealers to facilitate the trading of tokenized assets, ensuring liquidity and market stability. Tenev also noted that the SEC’s accredited investor rule, which currently restricts private market investments to individuals meeting high-income or net-worth thresholds, is another critical issue for the industry. He suggested updating the rule to allow broader participation based on financial literacy rather than wealth alone, a move he believes would democratize investment opportunities and bring US markets in line with other jurisdictions that have adopted more inclusive policies. Tenev’s remarks reflect a growing push among financial leaders for regulatory clarity on tokenization. He recently urged the SEC to approve tokenization efforts to modernize traditional finance. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called tokenized securities the “next frontier” in financial markets, arguing that the tokenization of stocks and bonds could make capital markets more efficient. Industry analysts expect tokenization to become a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, with McKinsey, BCG, and Bernstein forecasting a rapid expansion of blockchain-based real-world assets. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization for bonds, funds, commodities, and real estate, seeking faster settlement times and broader investor participation. Despite mounting industry support, US regulators have yet to establish a clear framework, raising concerns that the country could fall behind financial hubs like the EU, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi. Tenev warned that unless the US acts swiftly, it risks losing its leadership in capital markets as other jurisdictions embrace the next phase of financial innovation.

Title: Bond Traders Are Kept in Limbo After Powell Offers Few Clues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bond traders emerged from the Federal Reserve’s meeting exactly where they were before it began: with little conviction about where interest rates are headed as President Donald Trump casts uncertainty over the direction of the economy. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo US Students’ Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Treasury yields briefly jumped after the central bank’s statement appeared to indicate that it held rates steady because its progress on taming inflation had ebbed. But Chair Jerome Powell quickly swatted away those worries — saying he expects consumer-price increases to continue to slow — and yields came back down, ending the day virtually unchanged and echoing the swings in the US equity market. “This is a Fed that’s not in a hurry to take any further action,” Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. The Fed’s decision to pause the cycle of interest-rate cuts it kicked off in September was already widely anticipated on Wall Street. Since late last year, yields have risen sharply on expectations that the resilient economy, sticky inflation and policy shifts by Trump would prevent the US central bank from easing monetary policy much further. The repricing had left traders largely in sync with the Fed, which has adopted a wait-and-see approach as it watches for inflation to come back closer to its 2% target. Trump has also cast considerable uncertainty over the outlook by threatening to slap tariffs on imports and promising to lower taxes, both of which could put upward pressure on inflation and pour another round of stimulus onto the economy. Powell did little to chart the bond market’s direction one way or the other. He said he expects that the still-restrictive level of interest rates will continue to slow inflation, which appeared to ease some concern that the Fed could shift gears to raising interest rates again. He also declined to comment on how Trump’s policies may affect the Fed’s path, underscoring that the bank will follow where the data lead. “This does not sound like a Fed that’s looking for the next opportunity to cut rates,” Bob Michele, JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, said on Bloomberg Television. After Powell’s comments supported that speculation, swaps traders pared back their expectations for rate reductions this year by pricing in 43 basis points of cuts compared to 48 before the Fed’s announcement, with the first not coming until mid-2025. That shows traders anticipate just one quarter-point reduction this year, with the potential of a second such move. The stock market’s reaction was similar to the bond market’s. The S&P 500 Index dropped after the Fed’s announcement only to recover once Powell spoke. It ended slightly lower on the day, held down by worries about Trump’s still-unclear tariff policies and the threat to tech stocks posed by a Chinese company’s rollout of a low-cost artificial intelligence product. Treasury bonds ended Wednesday’s session little changed across the curve. The benchmark 10-year note — a key baseline for other debt — was flat at 4.53%, while the yield on two-year Treasuries was up 2 basis points at around 4.2%. What Bloomberg strategists say... “Policymakers are in a wait-and-see mode on how Trump’s policies play out. Powell also noted there have been two good inflation readings in a row and importantly expectations at the back-end are not going up, where it really matters.” — Alyce Andres, strategist. Read more on MLIV. For the bond market, the focus remains squarely on whether — and when — the Fed will cut rates next. “There’s heightened caution in the bond market at the moment,” said Lon Erickson, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “There’s nervousness around the outcome of those policies of the administration.” While expectations for a March rate reduction had increased earlier this week during a tech-driven rout in stocks that fueled demand for Treasuries, the swaps market is now pricing only a narrow chance of such a reduction. Still, traders had ratcheted up bullish bets on Treasuries in the leadup to the meeting in hopes of a signal from the Fed that a move in March was on the table. Wall Street economists, meanwhile, have diverged on their forecasts for the Fed’s policy path, though most have trimmed their expectations in recent months. Ahead of the January meeting, only Morgan Stanley was among major Wall Street banks that still saw a potential reduction at the next gathering in March. “For the bond market, we think it’s a holding pattern for the next couple of quarters,” Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said just ahead of the decision. “We think the Fed is on hold for the remainder of 2025.” --With assistance from Kristine Aquino and Edward Bolingbroke.
