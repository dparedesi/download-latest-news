Title: Why BlackRock’s $1B crypto bet could shape markets in 2026
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-blackrocks-1b-crypto-bet-could-shape-markets-in-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T14:00:16Z

BlackRock’s latest move signals a pivotal moment for the 2026 bull cycle – Here’s what you should know. BlackRock has officially ended its silence. After a period of strategic inactivity, the world’s largest asset manager has re‑entered the market, beginning a high‑conviction accumulation phase. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that over the last 72 hours, BlackRock has absorbed nearly $1 billion in digital assets. The firm transferred 9,619 BTC valued at $878 million and 46,851 ETH worth $149 million into its custody. This three-day blitz signals a decisive pivot from the choppy outflows of late 2025 into a concentrated ‘ETF 2.0’ era for 2026. To understand why BlackRock goes through long periods of flatlining followed by massive spikes, let’s view the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a global liquidity grocery store. During mute weeks, the store isn’t empty; it’s simply operating off the inventory kept in the backroom. In technical terms, this is the secondary market buffer. Authorized Participants (APs) often hold a surplus of shares or Bitcoin [BTC], allowing them to satisfy buy orders without the ETF ever needing to interact with the underlying spot market. To the outside observer, BlackRock appears inactive. But, in reality, the backroom supply is being quietly absorbed by investors. This is when the accumulation week triggers as the shelves run bare. When internal liquidity is exhausted or when quarterly rebalancing cycles converge, BlackRock is forced to enter the spot market to restock. This creates the massive green bars we see in the data, not necessarily representing a sudden change in sentiment, but the visible fulfillment of weeks of pent-up institutional demand. Needless to say, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF also falls into the same analysis. This comes at a time when, after a surge of optimism kicked off 2026, the market has hit a technical speed bump. Despite the three-day accumulation streak, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded outflows worth $130 million, cooling off from the inflows seen in the first week of the New Year. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETHA also saw $6.6 million in outflows this week, following a strong opening week. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the market was feeling the weight of this consolidation. Bitcoin was trading at $90,245.14, down by 2.41% in 24 hours, while Ethereum [ETH] has slipped to $3,118.03, a 4.99% drop during the same period. When such movements happen, these prices typically move sideways. The lack of aggressive selling from institutional giants prevents a total collapse, stabilizing the market at these higher valuations. For traders, this is the calm before the shock. History also shows that once BlackRock finishes this quiet accumulation, the resulting supply squeeze is often what pushes Bitcoin through major resistance levels, like the current $94,500 barrier.

Share this article BlackRock, the global investment management firm, moved about 3,064 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $276 million, along with 26,723 Ethereum worth more than $83 million, to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The latest transfers come as ETF flows in early 2026 turned volatile, with strong inflows at the start of January quickly giving way to sharp outflows. After solid buying on Jan 2 and Jan 5, sentiment reversed sharply on Jan 6 and Jan 7, resulting in net outflows for the period, per Farside Investors. IBIT, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, posted $130 million in redemptions yesterday as US spot Bitcoin funds suffered $486 million in net outflows, their biggest daily outflow since late November.

Title: Ethereum – Will the $3,400-level hold after whales, institutions’ latest bet?

Key resistance tests await the world’s largest altcoin. On 07 January 2026, Ethereum’s price surged to a critical $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone, with the market teetering on the edge. With liquidity building up around this level, the question remains – Can ETH break through this resistance, or would a pullback be imminent? James Wynn is in the news today after his 25x leveraged Ethereum long position, securing $87,594 in Bitcoin profits before diving into ETH. His floating profit of $172k from his $PEPE position was a testament to his aggressive strategy. Source: Onchain Lens Wynn’s bold approach highlights his confidence in Ethereum’s potential, especially as the digital asset is challenged by its key resistance levels. His aggressive positioning at these levels is a sign of optimism among crypto traders about the altcoin’s future. Ethereum’s bullish momentum surged on the back of record $114M inflows into Ethereum [ETH] ETFs on 06 January. Institutional investments, led by BlackRock, have spurred its credibility over the past few weeks and months. Source: Ted Pillows The recent hike in interest could be the start of a larger market rally, with liquidity building up to potentially break through resistance levels. Soon after James Wynn’s whale rotation, World Liberty Financial also signaled the same kind of move with a significant purchase of Ethereum. They swapped $2.5 million in WBTC for 770 ETH, further demonstrating the growing shift of institutional capital towards Ethereum. World Liberty Financial’s strategic move to acquire Ethereum is a sign of broader market sentiment that ETH may be ready for further growth on the price charts. On the back of greater institutional participation, this can be seen as a very bullish sign for the altcoin. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price seemed to be at a critical point, with liquidity clusters forming around the $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone. Source: CoinGlass Failure to break this range could pull the price down back to $3,000. The RSI stood at 61.72, indicating overbought conditions, while the MACD’s readings highlighted positive momentum. Source: TradingView A breakout could propel Ethereum to $3,800, but a reversal is also possible if the resistance holds.

Title: Trump calls for ban on ‘large institutional investors’ buying single-family homes

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/07/2026 9:15:41 PM PST by SeekAndFind President Trump on Wednesday called for a ban on “large institutional investors” buying single-family homes in a bid to address the issue of affordability. “I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he will discuss the topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. The proposed ban could prove to be a way in for Trump and Republicans to address the issue of affordability ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The president and his Republican allies have struggled to message on the issue as inflation persists and as Democrats have won a number of special and off-year elections by zeroing in on the topic. Several private equity firms and real estate trusts have swept-up up a considerable amount of single-family homes that are then turned around to rent. That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he will discuss the topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. The proposed ban could prove to be a way in for Trump and Republicans to address the issue of affordability ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The president and his Republican allies have struggled to message on the issue as inflation persists and as Democrats have won a number of special and off-year elections by zeroing in on the topic. Several private equity firms and real estate trusts have swept-up up a considerable amount of single-family homes that are then turned around to rent. That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

Title: War for Ukraine Day 1,413: A Brief Wednesday Night Update

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| January 7, 202611:41 pm| 17 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine I know it’s been a long, tragic, horrifying, day that has everyone one a fine edge, so I’m just going to run through the basics really quickly and call it a night. I do want to start with this excerpt from Lincoln’s speech at the Cooper Union: Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events. Back to the topic at hand. Imagine that: US did NOT SIGN the Paris “letter of intent” that describes how peace in Ukraine will be monitored by the US while Europe provides troops etc – distancing itself from the EU. In fact, US hasn’t signed anything that the coalition of willing has agreed to. [image or embed] — Olga Nesterova (@onestpress.onestnetwork.com) January 7, 2026 at 8:18 AM As I wrote last night: As with all of these leaks of what the US will do, might do, could do, etc, I’ll believe it when I see it. And as usual, we’re not going to see it. However we’ve not got Jared’s sex pest convicted extortionist father involved in trying to shake down the Ukrainians: Now Kushner Sr is part of these “discussions”? US hasn’t signed a single document that the coalition of the willing signed yesterday. In particular, the one where US is mentioned to be “overseeing” potential ceasefire. Come on. Too many words to say that you discussed Blackrock owning UA assets. [image or embed] — Olga Nesterova (@onestpress.onestnetwork.com) January 7, 2026 at 10:51 AM I’m pretty sure that if you could explain what the Kushner family has become and then ask the Bielskys whether it was worth the risk to rescue Jared’s grandparents, they’d say no. President Zelenskyy did not make a daily address today as he was again traveling. In this case to a meeting of the Council of Europe where he made an address to that body. Video below, English transcript after the jump. 7 January 2026 – 21:44 Thank you very much! Mr. President – Nikos, thank you for today’s visit, for the invitation, and our conversation. First of all, what I want to say, we are grateful to Denmark for its presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. And we appreciate the beginning of the Cyprus presidency. And we respect its territorial integrity and sovereignty. We are Ukraine, please respect our territorial integrity and sovereignty. And dear Mr. President – Nikos, Ursula, António, our friends, thanks for today’s meeting! Dear Maia! Presidents and Excellencies! I’m glad to be here as Cyprus begins its presidency of the Council of the European Union. And this is a presidency we all expect a lot from. For Ukraine, this moment is really very, very meaningful – just as it is for Cyprus – a member state that, unfortunately, remains divided, but committed to lasting peace – and is fully equal in Europe. And a country that may be smaller in size but has an equal voice in European institutions. This says a lot about what Europe truly is – that every nation matters, and every free country in Europe deserves to be part of our shared European home. And that is what makes Europe stable and peaceful. Ukraine also deserves this – to be an equal part of our common European home. And we hope that your presidency will be productive in moving us forward on this path. Nikos and I discussed this today. It is very important that Ukraine is among the priorities of the Cyprus presidency. And we are grateful for what the President has said – that we should aim to open negotiation clusters at the same time during your presidency – for both, of course, for both, Ukraine and our friends – Moldova. And this is a strong and positive ambition. And during your presidency, we hope to see the start of the implementation of the €90 billion support package for Ukraine – funding that strengthens our resilience, and with it, the resilience of all of Europe. And thank you again, Ursula, thank you, António, thank you for your support, and all the European leaders, for the decision, a very important decision – how to save Ukraine, it means how to save Europe. We need a practical mechanism that will allow these funds to truly help Ukraine. This mechanism must be designed not to create problems, of course, but to reduce the challenges we already face. And we are doing everything required on our side in the negotiation process, and we expect that no additional or excessive demands will be placed on Ukraine. At the same time, as Cyprus begins its presidency, peace negotiations have reached a new level of intensity. We work very, very actively – Ukraine, our European partners, and of course, the United States, and all members of our Coalition of the Willing – from Canada to Japan, from the EU to Australia. And it is possible – and we sincerely hope – that this war could end during your presidency. And of course, only if enough pressure is put on the aggressor. And we all understand how wars like this one – Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, our people, our children – come to an end. And when pressure is strong enough to exhaust the source of the war, peace comes. That pressure exists now, and the EU plays a key role in maintaining it. And I thank you for your willingness to help. Sanctions on Russia, support for Ukraine, strengthening our defense together – all of this works for peace, of course. And we have discussed – at the EU level, within the Coalition of the Willing, and in our bilateral work with Cyprus – that sanctions need to be upgraded. A new package is being prepared. And many steps are being taken to target Russia’s shadow fleet, and this will work. Every dollar Russia loses is a dollar that does not fuel the aggressor. It’s extremely important that we continue receiving support – both for our defense and for our diplomacy – equally from all parts of Europe. That’s why your support matters to us – your recent visit to Ukraine, Mr. President, and the unity we’re showing now, at the start of the Cyprus presidency. This year, one of the new European initiatives, very important – the SAFE program – must also prove its effectiveness. If it succeeds, Europe will become stronger. And in many ways, this depends on your presidency, Mr. President. And we hope that together with you – with Cyprus and with every EU country – we can work productively, of course. And I wish you a very successful presidency. I truly hope that during these months, Europe will become stronger, of course, and that people across our continent will feel that tomorrow can be safer, more stable, and better than today.

He grew up within the overlap of the Cuban revolutionaries that emerged from the Bay of Pigs fiasco and then became central players in the narco-cartels. Rubio is where he is today because a carteled up local high net worth individual in Miami wanted his own state legislator and then US Senator. So Lil Narco was protected from the crimes he himself committed while others were sacrificed to the criminal justice system.

And everyone in NATO provided some form of support. Second, the reason that the Russians don’t own all of Ukraine is because of the efforts of the Ukrainians with assistance from many others, including, but not limited to the US. Assistance, however, that does not, has not, and will not include actual military assistance as in having allies send their forces to come and fight alongside the Ukrainians. Third, what US assistance had been provided, which was always too little and far too often too late, has now essentially been stopped by Trump and his natsec team. “No new air defense systems have arrived from the U.S.; missiles are coming in bit by bit, but we want to speed it up.” – Zelenskyy. — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) January 7, 2026 at 8:14 AM Trump has had a wild day and evening on social media, I’m not going to get into the rest.

AlaskaReader January 8, 2026 at 12:14 am Thanks Adam YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:22 am Trump also claimed on Truth Social that he wants the defense budget to go from US$ 1T to US$ 1.5T. Leaving aside whether Congress will agree to fund such a massive increase (& I hope the Congressional Dems will be united in opposing such an increase), most of the pathologies the US military & MIC suffer from cannot be solved by shoveling more units of exchange into the machine. More funding can increase pay, that could help w/ recruitment & retention. More funding can boost stockpiling of spare parts, & that could help w/ equipment availability. Beyond that, the US faces real constraints in industrial capacity & human capital. Unless those bottlenecks are eased 1st (which takes years, if not decades), more money just means faster price inflation for weapons & munitions. See cost of tertiary education in the US. Spending 5% of GDP while the PRC spends < 2%, from a position of significant disadvantage in industrial capacity (weapons manufacturing accounts for 25% of all US manufacturing, vs. 4% in the PRC) & human capital, is also a recipe for a Soviet like decline. The bond market might also balk at taking on so much more debt, though you can bet the reactionaries will also leverage the “necessity” of military spending to gut social welfare further. The late stage Soviet Union vibes keep getting stronger & stronger. Adam L Silverman January 8, 2026 at 12:26 am @Westyny: You’re welcome.

Along with whatever instructions he’s issued by EO to defense contractors. YY_Sima Qian January 8, 2026 at 12:34 am @Adam L Silverman: That’s the next rung up the escalation ladder. Also, I think the US still brings critical capabilities to monitor Russian naval & air activities going into North Atlantic, I am not sure Denmank or European NATO is ready to just take over those capabilities & responsibilities. Europe is indeed between a rock & a hard place, so we have the farcical situation of Europe desperate trying to keep the US engaged in Ukraine, but also desperately trying to keep the US out of Greenland. As you’ve written repeatedly, Trump does not want to engage in Ukraine. Perhaps it is time Europe comes to grip w/ that fact, & stop trying to placate Trump. If Trump is willing to continue to sell US made weapons & munitions to Europe, for Europe to then donate to Ukraine, that is probably the best that can be hoped for.

Title: Why WisdomTree pulled its XRP ETF just as institutional demand peaked
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-wisdomtree-pulled-its-xrp-etf-just-as-institutional-demand-peaked/

WisdomTree used Rule 477 to avoid a public SEC setback, raising deeper questions about regulatory pressure. In the first week of 2026, XRP has taken center stage, becoming one of the most talked-about assets in the market. Analysts are calling it the “hottest trade” of the year, as it quickly outpaced Bitcoin’s early gains thanks to strong ETF inflows and its appeal as a less crowded alternative. But just as the momentum reached a fever pitch, a sudden regulatory U-turn has reminded investors that institutional adoption is rarely a straight line. According to an RW filing with the U.S. SEC, WisdomTree has formally withdrawn its registration statement for the WisdomTree XRP Fund (Form S-1). While “withdrawal” might sound like hitting a simple delete button, invoking Rule 477 serves as a strategic legal safeguard. Under the Securities Act of 1933, this rule lets an issuer pull a registration statement before it becomes effective and before any securities are sold. In this case, WisdomTree withdrew its Form S-1, originally filed on 2nd December 2024. By asking the Commission to withdraw “all exhibits and amendments,” WisdomTree has also reset its regulatory clock. This move also stops the SEC from issuing a formal “order of stop” or a public rejection, outcomes that could create a lasting negative precedent for the firm’s future crypto ambitions. It noted, “The Trust is requesting withdrawal of the Registration Statement because it has determined not to proceed at this time with the offering covered by the Registration Statement.” In the meantime, it can be said that WisdomTree’s retreat aligns with the standards set by BlackRock, though there’s no clear evidence to support that. Despite the frenzy of the 2026 altcoin ETF rush, BlackRock has remained absent from the XRP and Solana [SOL] race, appearing content to maintain its dominance solely within the Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] markets. This comes at a time when XRP ETFs are breaking records. On the 6th of January alone, XRP ETFs recorded $19.12 million in net inflows, with Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ recording $7.35 million in inflows, followed by Canary’s XRPC with $6.49 million and Bitwise with $3.54 million. Yet, despite a Cumulative Total Net Inflow sitting at a staggering $1.25 billion, the asset’s price action tells a different story. At press time, XRP slipped to $2.25, marking a 4.9% drop in just 24 hours. However, while some institutions are pulling back, others remain historically bullish. In a significant note to clients last year, Standard Chartered issued one of the most aggressive calls for the altcoin, setting a bold price target of $8 by the end of 2026. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s Head of Digital Assets Research, put it best when he said, “Improving U.S. regulatory clarity has made it easier for institutions to take exposure and has given Ripple and the XRP ecosystem room to build without constant litigation risk.” With an $8 target implying approximately 300% upside from current support levels, the stakes for 2026 couldn’t be higher.

“Adde parvum parvo magnus acervus erit.” –Ovid Do you like the world around you? Are you eager to take another trip around the sun? Like it or not. Eager or not. The New Year is here… We intend to make the best of it. We suppose you do too. Where to begin? Silver delivered some excitement to close out the year. After skyrocketing past $80 per ounce, the grey metal (Ag) has been on a volatile ride between liquidity squeezes and midnight margin calls. Behind the scenes, naked shorting – the fraudulent move where big banks sell silver they haven’t even borrowed – pushed the financial system to the breaking point. When prices spiked, these paper bets got torched. To maintain solvency, it is suspected the banks took to the overnight repo market for instant cash to cover their short positions. This may have provided a temporary solution. But the Federal Reserve, via the overnight repo market, cannot print silver. It can merely extend credit. We believe the market disorder that hit the day after Christmas will return in the New Year. And it’s only a matter of time before one of the big banks will be caught swimming with its pants down. As we enter 2026, it’s quite evident that the global landscape stands at a precarious crossroads. From our vantage point in Southern Appalachia, we see the convergence of a bursting technological bubble, a seismic shift in geopolitical aggression, and a radical transformation of the very nature of money and securities. Through ongoing discussions with our friend Dick, we’ve distilled this down to roughly four themes we expect will dominate in 2026. These four themes are presented herein. And, as a special bonus for reading to the end, we’ve included a practical recommendation for off-grid survival. So put on your favorite work boots – the older the better – and grab a shovel. It’s time to dig into the New Year’s edition of the Economic Prism. First off… There will be a broad realization in 2026 that the rapid buildout of AI has been a giant waste of money. That the trillions of dollars in capital piled into data centers and chips has been set on fire. This realization will appear in the form of a mega, AI driven stock market crash and associated debt crisis and economic contraction. We’re not predicting the end of AI. We’re merely suggesting that AI is something much different than what’s been advertised. Without question, AI can and will support many useful applications. When integrated into processes and systems where outcomes are dependent on data and logically defined protocols, AI has demonstrated abilities to quickly complete tasks. However, returns from the development of AI enabled tools are nowhere near what’s needed to justify the capital being expended. A recent study from MIT, for example, found that 95 percent of enterprise AI pilots fail to deliver a measurable return on investment. AI tools and applications may ultimately become ubiquitous. But unless something dramatically changes with the technology, above and beyond addressing degradation and hallucinations, AI will never be a form of actual intelligence or a replacement for the human ability to ask questions, innovate, and invent. Robert Gore, at Straight Line Logic, explains: “At root, the problem is that although AI can answer a seemingly infinite number of questions, it can’t ask a single one. It can be programmed to spot and attempt to resolve conflicts within data, but it doesn’t autonomously ask questions. From birth, the human mind is an autonomous question generator; it’s how we learn. […]. Curiosity and questions are the foundation of learning and intelligence. Reading even a page of something interesting or provocative will generate questions. Generative AI ‘reads’ trillions of pages without an iota of curiosity. No one who either hails or warns of AI surpassing human intelligence (HI) has explained how it will do so while bypassing the foundation of HI.” This critical defect is why AI will not live up to the expectations placed upon it. Moreover, when the realization hits that AI isn’t the immediate productivity miracle promised, the $5 trillion valuations we’re seeing will evaporate. Since AI-related stocks drove nearly 80 percent of market gains in 2025, a tech correction will trigger a broad market crash. As capital dries up, companies will cut spending and jobs, leading to a sharp recession or depression. The central planners in government generally respond to economic depressions in three ways. Through printing massive amounts of money, starting or escalating wars, or fabricating a pandemic. The money printing serves to bail out the big banks while a burgeoning war or faux pandemic, with the right propaganda, distracts the population from the problems at home, while also justifying massive money printing. This leads us to our next theme for 2026… For years, the focus was on the Forever Wars of the Middle East. Then it was the ongoing proxy war with Russia via Ukraine. But as we head into 2026, the Trump administration has executed a massive strategic pivot. The new front line? Venezuela. White House advisor Stephen Miller recently set the tone for this new focus with intense rhetoric on the history of Venezuelan energy. He stated: “American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs.” By highlighting the nationalization of oil as a direct theft from the American people, the White House makes a moral and legal case for more aggressive intervention and gunboat diplomacy. Under Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. has moved a massive naval force into the Caribbean, including the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group. Over the last few months, the U.S. has conducted dozens of maritime strikes against what it says are narco-terrorist vessels. In reality, this strategic focus on Venezuela has little to do with drugs and has everything to do with Venezuelan oil exports to China. President Trump has effectively declared a maritime blockade, with the Navy now authorized to seize sanctioned tankers. This is because despite heavy sanctions, China remains the primary buyer of Venezuelan crude, importing roughly 570,000 barrels per day. By blockading these waters, the U.S. isn’t just targeting the Maduro government of Venezuela. It’s cutting off a critical energy artery for Beijing. The administration’s Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine essentially warns that the Western Hemisphere is closed to Chinese strategic investment. The New Cold War is about more than semiconductors and TikTok. The waters off the coast of Venezuela are now the location of the global power struggle between Washington and Beijing. China isn’t just a casual observer in Caracas. It is the country’s greatest financier. Over the last two decades, Beijing has poured over $60 billion into Venezuela, much of it structured as ‘oil-for-loan’ deals. When Stephen Miller talks about the “tyrannical expropriation” of American assets, he’s also pointing to who moved in after the U.S. left (i.e., China). By keeping the Maduro government afloat with infrastructure projects and debt extensions, China secured a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere – in what the U.S. traditionally considers its backyard. Operation Southern Spear is a direct shot at China’s energy security. The U.S. is now physically seizing tankers like the Centuries, which was intercepted in late December carrying nearly 2 million barrels of oil bound for China. By stopping these shipments, President Trump is forcing Beijing to choose between backing Venezuela and risking a direct naval confrontation or losing billions in invested capital and an important source of oil. As this escalates in 2026, it will provide cover for the U.S. government to, once again, radically change the form and feel of money, which is our next theme for 2026. Several weeks ago, we talked about how the GENIUS Act, which was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025, requires stablecoins to be backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars or other low-risk assets, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries. We noted that this policy commences the next shift in American money. If you haven’t been keeping up with this development, join the club. The idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar, and creating massive new demand for U.S. Treasuries, sounds enigmatic. Perhaps this is why hardly anyone is talking about it. Quite frankly, we don’t like the idea and would rather ignore it. But, alas, this is happening whether we like it or not. And it will be a major theme in 2026. Stablecoins, as we understand them, are issued by private entities not by central banks. They are not a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Their issuance is driven by market demand, not monetary policy. When stablecoin issuers back their tokens with Treasury securities, they own the Treasury asset. Any interest payments from those Treasuries go to the issuer because the issuer holds the asset. In fact, the GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield directly to stablecoin holders as part of the stablecoin product. The GENIUS Act also requires a stablecoin issuer to publicly disclose reserves each month certified by executives. Larger issuers face additional auditing requirements. To add confusion, there are stablecoins that operate outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S. and are not compliant with the GENIUS Act. Tether, for example, issues a popular stablecoin called USDT and maintains a stable value pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Tether, at the same time, has essentially told Uncle Sam and its GENIUS Act to pound sand. Rather than backing its tokens exclusively with U.S. Treasuries, as required by the Genius Act, Tether keeps a chunk of its reserves in bitcoin and precious metals. In Q3 2025, Tether was the biggest buyer of gold, buying more gold than any central bank. Also, rather than providing audits, per the GENIUS Act, Tether prefers quarterly attestations. And, because it’s headquartered in El Salvador, it doesn’t meet the US-based requirement. Does that mean that USDT is better or worse than the USDC stablecoin issued by Circle, which is based in the U.S. and fully compliant with the GENIUS Act? Perhaps Tether’s existence as an offshore international digital dollar that operates outside of the U.S. government’s control, and with some of its reserves in gold, is an advantage. This, too, could be its demise. Remember, the Trump administration’s objective with the GENIUS Act is to create a new source of Treasury demand funded by private issuers so that America’s massive debt can be financed and an explicit default can be avoided. This is a power preserving adaptation. Tether is out of line with this objective. We believe the next shock event – economic recession, war escalation, or another pandemic – will serve as a midwife to stablecoin implementation. People rarely change their financial habits when things are going well. It takes a shock to compel them from an old system into a new one. Stablecoins, for instance, could be the perfect vehicle for sending and receiving government stimulus checks. They could also provide refuge during a banking crisis, where people can hold their cash outside the traditional fractional-reserve banking system. This will also come with countless hazards. Systemic risks of a run on stablecoin reserves and how this spills over into the Treasury market are still unknown. In short, as with all financial assets, and especially the new, untested variety, if stablecoin adoption accelerates, diversification across various stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, is advised. Lastly, stablecoins factor into another one of our themes for 2026… Asset tokenization has been in the works for many years. If you recall, during the covid pandemic mania of 2020-21, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) of art or collectibles became all the rage. The use of blockchain technology to record ownership allowed NFTs to be bought, sold, and traded. This technological application caught the attention of the big financial directors. Not for art and collectibles, but for major financial assets. Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, said in January 2024: “We believe the next step going forward will be the tokenization of financial assets, and that means every stock, every bond … will be on one general ledger.” Asset tokenization, in short, is the process of turning a real-world building, a stock, a bond, or a gold bar into a digital chip. And stablecoins are the money used to play the game. Before the GENIUS Act, big banks were hesitant to touch tokenization because they didn’t have a legal version of digital cash to use for settlement. The GENIUS Act created Payment Stablecoins (like the compliant version of USDC). Now, a bank like JPMorgan can tokenize a US Treasury bond and feel safe accepting a compliant stablecoin as payment, knowing the coin meets federal reserve and audit standards. What’s more, a tokenized bond using stablecoins can be issued without a single human accountant being involved. Imagine a corporation wants to borrow money. Instead of a traditional bank loan, they issue a Tokenized Bond on the blockchain. First, the corporation sets up a Smart Contract for the bond. The contract could say: “I am borrowing 1,000,000 USDC. I will pay 5 percent interest annually. Payments happen every 30 days.” In the traditional banking world, a bank would have to manually calculate interest for thousands of bondholders and mail checks or process wires. In the tokenized world, at midnight on the payment date, the Smart Contract takes a digital snapshot of every wallet holding the bond tokens. It instantly calculates how much interest each person is owed. The contract then automatically pulls the interest amount from the corporation’s stablecoin reserve and pushes it into the bondholders’ wallets in USDC. As we said at the outset, we don’t like the idea of stablecoins becoming a de facto digital dollar. Its advancement via the GENIUS Act is for the purpose of allowing the federal government to keep running up massive deficits. We consider this to be deceitful. We’d rather ignore it. But we can’t. The legislative framework is in place, and the big banks are moving forward. At this point we have more questions than answers. Namely, by tokenizing assets, which can then be traded, and can act as collateral, won’t the growth of money explode? What will this do to consumer price inflation, and the value of dollars people hold in their traditional bank accounts? There are also issues of privacy. The complete digitization of money and tokenization of assets comes with full system surveillance and tracking. How will a person’s spending be tracked? Will spending be tied to a social credit score with preprogrammed allowances and restrictions? Will the loss of financial privacy destroy what’s left of freedom and liberty for American citizens? What are the systemic risks inherent to building such a complex digital financial world? What happens if there’s a major black sky event where power and communications are disrupted for an extended period of time, whether from a geomagnetic storm, cascading grid failure, or a coordinated cyber-attack? No doubt, we’ll be monitoring and tracking the greater adoption of stablecoins and development of asset tokenization as they take shape throughout the year. We’ll look to adapt accordingly, while also maintaining diversification across both old money and new money systems. Certainly, maintaining wealth that is completely off-grid and outside of the banking system, like physical gold and silver, is of critical importance. Before we close, we’d like to leave you with one practical action you can take to prepare for war, inflation, or the breakdown of an ever-increasing complex digital world. Assuming you have food storage, and some basic backup power such as a simple battery storage system that can charge with portable solar panels, there is the critical, and often overlooked need for micronutrients. After two weeks, no matter how much protein and carbs you have, you need micronutrients for your brain and body, or you start losing mental clarity, strength, and a well-functioning digestive system. The simple solution is sprouting. When the time comes, the ability to be a ‘jar farmer’ to sustain health via sprouts will be essential. To get started, take a look at Sprout People. There you will find a great education section and a large variety of nutrients you probably never imagined could be sprouted.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum, And XRP ETFs Are Back: Over $800 Million Signal Investor Return
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-etfs/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T22:00:17Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs are seeing renewed institutional interest to start the year, providing a bullish outlook for the crypto market. This development comes amid BTC’s rally above $90,000, with the flagship crypto now targeting new 2026 highs. SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP ETFs saw over $800 million in daily net inflows on January 5. The BTC ETFs took in $697.25 million, led by BlackRock and Fidelity’s fund. This inflow was notably the largest since the October 10 crypto crash, marking a huge positive for the Bitcoin price. Notably, BTC has reached a 2026 high above $94,000 amid these inflows, with sustained demand likely contributing to higher prices. Furthermore, the Ethereum ETFs recorded daily net inflows of $168.13 million, building on the $174.43 million inflows on January 2. The net inflows recorded on January 2 were the largest since December 9. These inflows of the ETH ETFs come as ETH staking demand rises, with the staking entry queue now over 200x larger than the staking exit queue. This is significant as the institutional and staking demand could both contribute to a supply shock for the ETH price. Meanwhile, just like the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETFs also recorded significant inflows on January 5. These funds took in $46.10 million on the day, marking their highest flows in the last month. It is worth noting that these XRP funds have not recorded daily net outflows since they launched in November. This has likely contributed to XRP’s outperformance following Bitcoin’s rally above $90,000 to start the year. The altcoin currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 20%, outperforming all crypto assets in the top 10 ranking except Dogecoin. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion. This came as he noted that they had taken in over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of the year, with every fund seeing considerable flows. Based on this, the Bloomberg analyst noted that they are on pace to take $150 billion in inflows in 2026. “If they can take in $22b when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he added. Meanwhile, Balchunas stated that the total 2026 flows for these Bitcoin ETFs will depend on price. Although he noted it wasn’t a formal prediction, the Bloomberg analyst mentioned that they could take in between $20 and $70 billion in inflows if the BTC price underperforms. On the other hand, if BTC rises to around $130,000 and $140,000, Balchunas believes that the ETFs could record up to $70 billion in inflows this year.

Title: Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes

Posted on 01/07/2026 11:43:41 AM PST by ducttape45 Trump to ban large institutional investors from buying up single-family homes Trump said that he would discuss the announcement further at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is taking immediate steps to ban large institutional investors from purchasing additional single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans. In a post shared Tuesday afternoon, Trump said buying and owning a home was long considered “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but claimed that record-high inflation under the Biden administration and congressional Democrats has made that goal increasingly unattainable, particularly for younger Americans. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,” Trump wrote. “But now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people.” Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Trump said he would move to prohibit large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes and urged Congress to codify the policy into law. “People live in homes, not corporations,” he wrote. Trump also noted that he would discuss the announcement at his speech in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Large institutional investors now control a meaningful share of America’s single-family housing stock, a trend that has accelerated over the past decade. Research compiled from Zillow, Redfin, CoreLogic, and the American Enterprise Institute shows that institutional investors own roughly 3–4 percent of all US single-family homes, translating to more than 500,000 houses nationwide. While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

While that may appear modest at the national level, the concentration is far higher in certain metro areas, particularly in fast-growing Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, Tampa, and Charlotte. Investor activity surged following the 2008 financial crisis and spiked again during the pandemic-era housing boom. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency and Redfin data, investors accounted for 25–30 percent of home purchases in some markets during peak periods in 2021 and 2022. A significant portion of those purchases came from large corporate buyers, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, many of which targeted lower-priced and entry-level homes suitable for conversion into single-family rentals. Housing analysts note that institutional ownership is disproportionately focused on the rental market, where growth has been strongest. CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

CoreLogic estimates that the institutional single-family rental sector nearly tripled in size between 2012 and 2024. Studies from the Urban Institute and AEI have linked heavy investor activity to reduced housing supply for first-time buyers, faster price appreciation, and rising rents in markets with high corporate concentration.

I didn't put the word "BREAKING" in the title cuz I hate it when I see that. Thoughts? This will be an OUTSTANDING move by Trump. MonCommie of NYC is moving in the opposite direction and wants government and blackrock to buy up all the housing. Guess Mundane-u will be breaking the law then. One company near a relative’s home in a major city only winds up renting to what become a dozen illegals, causing even a local news story, when police show up. An older couple used to own it. You can find used condoms near their house on the street, as illegals go there for sex romps. The bigger city won’t let the police do anything to stop it, because, well, illegals are gonna illegal. I agree it would be a good thing. But I question if the Federal Government has such authority. I can't think of anything in the Constitution that would grant them such authority. and 1 individual(Bill Gates) from buying up Farmland ? It’s a popular move that puts TDS uniparty memebers on the wrong side of another 80/20 issue ahead of the midterms. 😆 MonCommie of NYC is moving in the opposite direction and wants government and blackrock to buy up all the housing. and they’ll end up in the hands of muslims The Chinese have had their finger in this for a long time, in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and elsewhere. Although a great idea, only Congress can enact that law, not the President. So I am to be restricted as to whom I can sell my house; I am not to be allowed to seek the best offer I can get??? As much as I do think corporate buyers have “bid up” home values in some areas, by their buying coming in where private individual buyers might have been unwilling to pay the asking price, and that activity has, in some areas, “saved” some price inflation that had been going on (the corporate buyer has the resources to pay a higher price and hang on to the property until the natural market of private buyers is willing to pay that much; in part by just renting the property until then). However, I am still not in love with the law intervening on what we can and cannot do when choosing to whom we can sell our own property. I believe this is good. To get a good idea of the cost of housing I look at the median wage of the community and that will offer some idea of the housing prices. The large investors are able to bid the prices for SFR beyond that threshold resulting in a potential buyer being able to only rent for long periods. The on the ground issue will aways be that that large investors have much more capital and can bid the price of a property up beyond the ability of the local purchaser. The irony is that much of the capital used to price the homes out of market tolerance comes from retirement funds which some of might have come from the exact community. EXCELLENT! I’ve called for this for a long time. This will be MASSIVELY popular with younger voters as well as blue collar voters - across all ethnic groups. Dang! There goes my 2026 financial plan.../s worst idea ever, and would result in the complete collapse of the real estate market and wipe out the net worth of most in or near retirement that have all their networth tied up in their homes. Write to your congressman? Yeah, that's the ticket.

He says owning a home is part of the American Dream. Big real estate investors have bought many homes, pushing prices up. Trump will share more housing ideas at Davos.

Title: Trump says he’s banning institutional investors from scooping up single-family homes

Full Content:
President Trump said Wednesday he will seek to ban large investors from buying and then renting out single-family homes – in a bold attempt to tackle the US housing crisis. Trump did not say exactly how his plan would work, but it represents a major new initiative to lower the cost of homeownership after roughly a decade of large investors and private-equity firms buying up hundreds of thousands of single-family homes. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.” Trump said he would discuss the ban – along with other affordability efforts – at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in two weeks. Shares in Invitation Homes, the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, plunged 6% after Trump’s announcement. Blackstone and Apollo Global Management also fell roughly 6% and 5%, respectively. Invitation Homes and Apollo Global Management did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. After the 2008 financial crisis sent home prices nosediving, major investment firms swooped in to buy up the leftover inventory – often purchasing properties in bulk at foreclosures. Housing advocates have argued that widespread corporate ownership can reduce supply and inflate prices, pushing homeownership even further out of reach. In early 2025, investors of all sizes – including a small sliver of larger firms – accounted for roughly 30% of single-family US home purchases, according to a report from CJ Patrick Co. But in certain cities, investment firms hold much larger chunks of what historically would be starter homes – accounting for more than 20% of all home sales in Houston, Miami, Phoenix and Las Vegas during the pandemic, for example. In 2024, institutional investors owned 25% of rental homes in Atlanta and 18% in Charlotte, according to a US Government Accountability Office analysis. Stephen Schwarzman’s Blackstone is among those hoovering up homes – last year controlling more than 230,000 units as the largest private-equity owner of US apartments, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. A Blackstone spokesperson told The Post the company has been a net seller of homes for the past decade and its holdings are down by more than one-fifth. “That said, we believe our current portfolio is poised to continue to perform quite well and operate at the highest standards for residents,” the spokesperson added. These Wall Street bigwigs often come equipped with huge all-cash offers, making it difficult for first-time buyers to compete. These pressures – combined with falling construction rates and pandemic-era strains – pushed the national median single-family home price to $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors. It hit a record high of $435,300 over the summer. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily. In another troubling sign for America’s residential real estate market, the median age for a first-time homebuyer hit 40 years olds in 2025, according to the NAR. That’s up from 38 years old in 2024 and 33 in 2020. First-time buyers accounted for just 21% of all US home purchases in 2025 – a new record-low, the NAR said. It’s unclear if Trump’s ban on institutional investor homebuying is possible without congressional approval. “I understand the purpose is to remove corporate competition to keep home prices more affordable, and that is a good intention, but it will be very hard to execute,” Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told The Post. Trump has sought to blunt Democrats’ election-year criticism of his economic records with a number of other proposals intended to lower costs — including using tariff threats to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices and vowing to do the same with oil and health insurance firms. He has also pressured the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates at a faster pace and called for streamlining construction rules. Advertisement

Title: JPMorgan’s 5% Bond ETF Looks Like A Coiled Spring Right Now

Investing EMB delivered 13% returns in 2025 but is flat in early 2026 despite offering a 5.5% yield. Fed rate cuts make EMB’s yield more attractive relative to falling Treasury yields. Venezuelan bonds doubled since August after Maduro’s removal. This shows political risk premiums can compress quickly. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. If you’re hunting for yield in 2026, emerging market bonds just became more interesting. The iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:EMB) offers a 5.5% dividend yield as the asset class experiences a fundamental shift. The fund delivered 13% returns in 2025 but has gone quiet in early 2026, up just 0.07% year-to-date. That pause might not last. The catalyst? Venezuela’s defaulted bonds surged to 43 cents on the dollar after President Nicolás Maduro’s surprise removal in early January, more than doubling since August. While EMB holds 658 emerging market bonds across dozens of countries, the Venezuela situation illustrates a broader truth: political risk that seemed permanent can evaporate overnight, unlocking value income investors had written off. The biggest factor for EMB in 2026 is the Federal Reserve’s rate trajectory. Emerging market bonds historically rally when the Fed pivots dovish, and expectations are building for additional rate cuts this year. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)’s outlook suggests the central bank will bring rates down from the current 3.50% to 3.75% range, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a 50 basis point reduction to 3% to 3.25%. Here’s why that matters: when U.S. Treasury yields fall, EMB’s 5.5% yield becomes dramatically more attractive. Investors seeking income start looking beyond domestic bonds, and emerging market debt becomes competitive again. The fund’s 13% gain in 2025 coincided with the Fed’s initial rate cuts. If the easing cycle continues in 2026, EMB could see renewed inflows from institutions rotating out of lower-yielding developed market bonds. Watch the Federal Reserve’s FOMC statements and quarterly Summary of Economic Projections for rate guidance. These releases happen roughly every six weeks and directly influence emerging market bond pricing within hours. EMB holds USD-denominated sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds from emerging markets, eliminating direct currency risk for U.S. investors. With $15.7 billion in assets and a 0.39% expense ratio, it’s a liquid, low-turnover fund operating since 2007. The micro factor to watch is the fund’s country allocation and credit quality mix. Bond ETF compositions shift as countries issue new debt, ratings change, and geopolitical situations evolve. BlackRock publishes updated holdings files monthly on the fund’s webpage, revealing which countries are gaining or losing weight in the portfolio. If you see increased allocations to countries with improving credit ratings or reduced exposure to deteriorating situations, that’s a positive signal. Conversely, concentration in higher-risk issuers could indicate the fund is reaching for yield in a way that increases volatility. The Vanguard Emerging Markets Government Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VWOB) offers similar exposure with a lower 0.25% expense ratio and slightly higher 5.7% yield. With $5.8 billion in assets, it’s smaller than EMB but still highly liquid. VWOB pays monthly distributions, and Vanguard’s lower fee structure means more bond income flows to shareholders over time. For long-term holders focused purely on income efficiency, VWOB deserves consideration. EMB delivered strong 2025 returns but has stalled in early 2026, creating potential entry opportunity for investors seeking 5.5% yield with upside if Fed rate cuts resume and emerging market fundamentals continue improving. The Venezuela situation proves political risk premiums can compress quickly, and with the Fed likely to ease further this year, the macro environment favors emerging market bonds more than it has in years.

Title: Morgan Stanley Files for Spot Ethereum ETFs as TradFi Deepens Crypto Exposure

Written & Edited byCamila Grigera Naón Morgan Stanley filed for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday, becoming the latest American bank to do so. The move is designed to track ETH’s price while passing staking rewards through to shareholders. The news comes just days after Bank of America also expanded client access to crypto amid rising institutional demand. In addition to Ethereum, Morgan Stanley also submitted ETF applications linked to Bitcoin and Solana on Tuesday. A relatively late entrant to the crypto space, the bank’s move represents its first involvement in this segment of the ETF market. The announcement arrived about two years after crypto-focused ETFs in the US started to proliferate. Morgan Stanley’s S-1 filing marks a significant step in integrating cryptocurrency within traditional finance. Managing $1.6 trillion in assets, the bank is broadening client exposure to crypto via regulated investment products. Back in October, Morgan Stanley dropped restrictions on financial advisors recommending crypto ETFs…Now launching their own.Makes sense given Morgan’s massive distribution. Clearly they were seeing meaningful demand from clients for crypto ETFs. https://t.co/9vIroWf8y9 The submission reflects a broader shift among established Wall Street institutions toward greater involvement in digital assets. On Monday, BeInCrypto reported that Bank of America began authorizing wealth management advisors to recommend a portfolio allocation of 1% to 4% in cryptocurrency. Before that, firms including BlackRock, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup also launched trading operations and tokenization services. While banks appear increasingly driven by a fear of missing out on crypto-related opportunities, the broader market has been underperforming, particularly in recent months. While Morgan Stanley’s endorsement supports broader mainstream acceptance, it arrives during a period of heightened volatility. Most spot Bitcoin ETF assets remain concentrated among retail investors, many of whom have faced recent losses. This environment has accelerated a shift toward professional holders, with institutional ownership rising from 20% to 28%, reflecting a gradual rebalancing of market participation. At the same time, the broader crypto market has shed roughly $600 billion in Bitcoin market capitalization since October. Small-cap indices have fallen to levels last seen in November 2020, while newly launched altcoin ETFs have quickly slipped into negative territory. Further uncertainty looms as US President Donald Trump is expected to announce his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair as soon as Friday. Kevin Hassett has emerged as a leading contender to replace Jerome Powell. If he is appointed, markets will anticipate a more dovish monetary stance.

Title: Terrified Investors Are Bracing for an AI Bubble “Reckoning”

By Victor Tangermann Published Jan 7, 2026 1:08 PM EST Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount. For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate. Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit. Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices. “Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT. One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.” GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings. “Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said. At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse. “We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.” Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now. “2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo. Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained. In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.” But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” More on the AI bubble: AI Investors Furious at Suggestion That There’s an AI Bubble I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: Jamie Dimon’s bombshell on proxy advisory delivers a body blow to the firms he called ‘incompetent’
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-asset-management-proxy-advisory-iss-glass-lewis-what-it-means/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T17:30:01Z
Full Content:
In a break that shapes the architecture of shareholder power, JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages more than $7 trillion in client assets — severed all ties this week with proxy advisory giants ISS and Glass Lewis. It will now rely solely on an internal, AI-driven voting platform called Proxy IQ — the first such move by a major asset manager. It comes days after President Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to investigate proxy advisers, citing concerns that their influence on board votes, CEO pay, and ESG policies is driven more by political agendas than fiduciary duty. Together, Trump and JPMorgan waged a two-front assault on the proxy advisory industry — one political, one financial. Trump’s order adds regulatory firepower. Dimon’s decision delivers a market blow. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, relentless critic of proxy advisers, called these firms “incompetent” and their dominance “done with.” The bank’s full exit marks a direct challenge to a system many view as opaque and obsolete. Yet in dismantling the old gatekeepers, JPMorgan may be quietly installing itself as a new one. By replacing outside advisers with its own AI platform, it now controls the very machinery of shareholder voting it once condemned. What began as a crusade against centralized influence may be remembered as a corporate land grab. These developments underscore the rise of a more decentralized and digitally engaged electorate — part of a broader shift toward democratization of investing, as individuals gain real-time access to ballots and influence decisions once shaped by a handful of power brokers. This spring’s proxy season may not hinge on an activist’s letter, banker spreadsheets or hedge fund media blitzes … but instead on the quick, quiet clicks of individual investors — each with a few hundred shares — voting between Zoom calls and scrolling through message board threads. In March 2025, ExxonMobil moved to elevate individual investors — still shaped by its 2021 clash with Engine No. 1 — even without adopting default proxy instructions. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a program that lets individual stakeholders automatically follow board recommendations, aiming to counter chronically low voting turnout and disproportionate influence of institutional and activist investors. And Exxon isn’t alone. Small investors blocked a share conversion at AMC in August 2023, triggering a lawsuit and court-approved settlement. The conversion and split took effect, revealing the persistence of a shareholder base once hailed as the company’s savior. At Disney in April 2024, Nelson Peltz’s proxy fight culminated in a vote that drew support from fans-turned-shareholders mobilizing around board accountability and creative direction. While Peltz lost, Disney revamped investor engagement. Main Street investors rallied behind Elon Musk’s billion-dollar pay package at Tesla in June 2024 and again in October 2025, circulating voting instructions and videos across social media. This outreach momentum carried into the subsequent vote. One important new mechanism drawing attention is pass-through proxy voting — allowing mutual fund and ETF investors to vote their shares directly instead of delegating authority to fund managers. It gives individuals direct control over votes attached to their assets. But it still only matters if they vote. Many independent shareholders skip proxy voting, as notices go unread. Engagement usually emerges in a contested election, as investors hold their ballots to see how the fight unfolds. As of March 2024, BlackRock expanded its Voting Choice program to U.S. individual investors in select funds, enabling direct proxy voting. This marked the first major rollout of pass-through voting within fund structures. Still, only 8% of BlackRock funds offer it, but it is increasing pressure across the industry as analysis grows around individual investor inclusion. But Waiting for Godot is a mistake. Regulation can tweak the system, but real change begins when investors are brought in early, understand the stakes, trust the process and choose to engage. Funds should … Implement full pass-through voting across all funds in 2026. BlackRock’s Larry Fink, Vanguard’s Salim Ramji, Fidelity’s Abigail Johnson, State Street’s Yie-Hsin Hung and J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon can set standards now. Every individual investor’s capital carries its own vote. Boards in parallel should … Influence doesn’t begin with a proxy. It starts with a viral post that reframes a proposal in plain English, sharp YouTube explainer or social threads that turn legalese into a clear takeaway. This is where shareholder sentiment is formed and fortified. As proxy season approaches, the same question looms: Do we have the votes? This year, outcomes may hinge on stakeholders who rarely join investor calls. “Trust is like the air we breathe — when it’s present, nobody really notices. But when it’s absent, everybody notices.” — Warren Buffett The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.

January 07, 2026 11:28 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Market Regime Detection Artificial Intelligence (AI) Global Market Report 2025" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global market regime detection artificial intelligence (AI) market is experiencing robust growth, projected to expand from $1.49 billion in 2024 to $1.84 billion in 2025, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.8%. This growth is fueled by rising demand for adaptive investment strategies, predictive analytics in asset management, and a focus on early detection of market shifts. As the market continues its upward trajectory, it is set to reach $4.28 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 23.4%. Driving factors include adoption of AI-powered tools for portfolio optimization, automated identification of market regimes, and enhanced cloud-based analytics. Significant sector trends include advancements in AI-driven predictive modeling and machine learning for regime detection. Real-time analytics is a key growth driver, enabling market participants to respond rapidly to market conditions. For example, in 2023, 59% of financial sector supervisory authorities embraced SupTech applications, highlighting the increasing reliance on AI for supervision. Key industry players are leveraging advanced AI models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), to maintain a competitive edge.

Title: Popular collective crypto trading strategy is vulnerable to losses and insider exploitation, according to new research

About us Copy link A new academic paper warns that collective crypto trading schemes — which pool user funds and trade automatically with them — are inherently vulnerable to losing profits and being exploited by insiders, no matter how they are designed. These findings come from research by academics at Cornell Tech. In their research, they examined the fundamental trade-offs between profitability and economic fairness in such systems. The team of eight researchers who co-authored the January 2 paper found that these Collective Investment Algorithms, or CoinAlgs, posed unavoidable risks, regardless of whether they choose to keep their trading strategies private or opt for full transparency. “CoinAlgs can either be transparent, and risk losing profits; or be private, and open the door for unfair value extraction by insiders,” the researchers said. “Even in scenarios where a CoinAlg may seem benign, subtle backdoors can be inserted that lead to profits from adversaries.” Collective Investment Algorithms are not a new phenomenon. They have existed in the traditional financial world for years, and are used at asset management firms like BlackRock and Renaissance Technologies to execute trades across multiple client portfolios. But in crypto trading circles they’ve surged in popularity in recent years, supercharged by the proliferation of artificial intelligence. They promise to place institutional-grade investment strategies or specialised trading intelligence within the reach of retail investors, although these tools often lack the investor protections of regulated intermediaries. Many CoinAlgs operating across DeFi skew heavily towards speculative assets, with a preference for emerging tokens and highly volatile memecoins. The researchers used historical transaction data from Uniswap, the biggest decentralised exchange, to simulate a profitable CoinAlg that correctly predicts future asset prices. In this situation, they found that even minimal information leakage from a private CoinAlg Enabled significant value extraction by arbitrageurs, investors who exploit temporary price differences to make small but consistent profits. At the same time, those who use private CoinAlgs experience the additional risk of insiders using privileged information to conduct similar arbitrage or frontrunning trades to extract profits. Transparent CoinAlgs didn’t fare much better. They avoid issues of insider trading by ensuring all algorithmic trading models and data is open source and public. Yet this makes it even easier for arbitrageurs to extract profits from the CoinAlgs’s trades, with little ability for recourse. “Even moderate defensive strategies against arbitrage incur a significant cost of transparency and thus [eroding] profits,” the researchers said. Yet despite the issues, CoinAlgs are likely here to stay. Many investors are drawn to them because they advertise the ability to generate lucrative returns by outsourcing difficult investment decisions to AI algorithms. The interest in such products is only set to increase as companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google continue to pour money and resources into AI development. “CoinAlgs are an inevitable part of the financial landscape,” the researchers said. “The search for principled guardrails remains an important avenue for future work.” Tim Craig is DL News’ Edinburgh-based DeFi Correspondent.

Title: Ethereum Staking Queue Grows: What Does This Mean For ETH Prices Moving Forward?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As Ethereum (ETH) recently reclaimed key levels above $3,200, the dynamics within its staking system have shifted significantly. For the first time in nearly six months, the entry queue for staking Ethereum now exceeds the exit queue, a development viewed by many as a bullish indicator for ETH prices. Currently, a substantial 1.32 million ETH is waiting to be staked, with an average wait time of 23 days, while only about 3,000 ETH are queued for withdrawal, which takes merely an hour, indicating a net increase in locked ETH rather than unlocked coins. Analysts at Bull Theory suggest that historically, significant spikes in entry queues occur when investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential rises. In contrast, increases in exit queues are often associated with market fear or forced sell-offs. Presently, the landscape shows rising entry demand, decreasing exit pressure, and an overall increase in net lock-up, a combination that has frequently been observed before stronger bullish cycles for ETH. Compounding this positive sentiment is the current high level of network activity. Daily transactions on the Ethereum network are trending upwards, indicating that market participants are actively engaging with the platform rather than leaving it. Enhanced network usage leads to increased ETH burning, contributing to a supply crunch that further supports the asset’s value. According to the analysts, institutional investment is one of the notable drivers behind the current surge in staking. In just the past two weeks, BitMine – the public company with the largest Ethereum holdings – has staked around $2.58 billion worth of ETH, signaling a long-term commitment to the asset and suggesting growing institutional interest in the digital asset. This development comes ahead of potential catalysts that could further boost staking demand. While the BlackRock Ethereum staking ETF is still awaiting approval, its eventual green light could grant access to a broader pool of traditional capital, thereby enhancing the overall staking demand for ETH. Additionally, ETH has successfully broken out of a three-month downward trend. If it can reclaim levels between $3,500 and $3,600, the analysts predict that a substantial rally could follow. As of now, ETH has recovered by 11% in the past two weeks according to CoinGecko data, positioning the token just below these key levels at $3,270. This performance has even surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC), which has recorded gains of just 6% in the same time frame. Taking into account additional factors such as the anticipated approval of the BlackRock ETF and the potential for regulatory clarity through the passing of the Market Structure Bill, also known as the Clarity Act, Ethereum appears to be in a strong position to experience a significant rally in 2026.

Title: Morgan Stanley Pushes Past Crypto Blues to Build its First Bitcoin ETF

Bitcoin ETFs just notched $697 million worth of inflows on Monday, their biggest gain since early October. Jamie Wilde Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Morgan Stanley has become the first big US bank to seek Securities and Exchange Commission approval for crypto ETFs, products it designed to track the prices of bitcoin and solana. The latest move by the Wall Street firm, which opened access to crypto funds for all its clients last fall after previously making them available only to high-net-worth investors, comes as the finance industry expands crypto offerings despite tepid interest from retail investors burned by a selloff last fall. It’s been two years since spot bitcoin ETFs were first listed in the US, and major financial companies including BlackRock and Fidelity have rolled out their own products since. Banks, however, have hung back from ETFs, instead directing their advisors to offer clients options from other companies. Bank of America yesterday started letting its advisors do just that. But Morgan Stanley’s move could tap into a rapidly growing opportunity: Bitcoin ETFs notched $697 million worth of inflows Monday, their biggest gain since early October. That’s before money started flowing out as the price of bitcoin slipped, dragging investor optimism down with it. This year, so far, seems like a turnaround: Cautiously Optimistic: As money poured into bitcoin ETFs, the price of bitcoin also rose, climbing about 6% for the year as of yesterday afternoon. While retail traders still seem hesitant to dive all the way back into crypto, ETFs offer an investing option with a degree of separation from the volatile assets. And institutional interest, which judging from recent news is still high, could signal brighter long-term prospects for the sector. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs proved they’re still the go-to middlemen for Wall Street deals amid a near-record $4.8 trillion global M&A bonanza For the first time since 2018, the Wells Fargo stagecoach is rolling into a new year without the burden of a Federal Reserve asset cap. Forecasters predict gold’s rally will stretch through December 2026, although one analysis says there’s reason for caution. Despite a recent pickup in dealmaking, the industry is sitting on a backlog of at least 31,000 companies valued at $3.7 trillion. Commerce Department data released this week showed US GDP rose 4.3% in the third quarter, with the American consumer to thank for it. Standout deals included Union Pacific’s $88 billion purchase of Norfolk Southern and the $56.6 billion deal to take Electronic Arts private. Innovative as the tokenized funds may be for JPMorgan, the bank is actually chasing an existing trend on Wall Street. Bank of America analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings will grow 14% next year, and sees the index reaching 7,100. Morgan Stanley cut its rating of Tesla for the first time in two years on Monday to “equal weight,” which is equivalent to a hold. Connecticut claims Kalshi, Robinhood and Crypto.com don’t have the proper licenses to handle sports wagers in the state. As bitcoin struggles to recoup some of this year’s dramatic losses, ETFs based on Ethereum and Solana are gaining ground. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: Bitcoin ETFs come into year 'like a lion’: 600% surge at current pace

US spot bitcoin ETFs attracted over $1.2 billion in the first two trading days of 2026, with analysts projecting annual inflows could reach $150 billion. Cointelegraph in your social feed US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have started the year at an explosive pace that could, if maintained, see it blow out total inflows from 2025. “The spot Bitcoin ETFs are coming into 2026 like a lion,” said Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on Tuesday. He pointed out that there have been more than $1.2 billion in inflows in the first two trading days of the year, “with everyone eating,” meaning nearly all funds have seen inflows. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) was the exception. Balchunas observed that if this pace is maintained, it would mean $150 billion in annual inflows, which is around 600% more than the total inflow for 2025. “Told ya’ll if they can take in $22 billion when it’s raining, imagine when the sun is shining,” he said. Spot BTC ETFs in the US saw net inflows of $21.4 billion in 2025, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) taking the lion’s share. However, it marks a decline from the $35.2 billion net inflows seen in 2024. Monday’s whopping $697 million net inflow was the largest for three months as BTC prices returned to and remained above $90,000 again following a tumultuous fortnight to end 2025. Related: Investors funnel $32B into US crypto ETFs despite year-end pullback According to Fabian Dori, CIO at Sygnum, this renewed ETF demand is increasingly relevant for market structure. He noted that ETF demand is steadily absorbing circulating supply, pointing to a potential long-term demand shock, rather than short-term speculative flows. Momentum appeared to be cooling on Tuesday, however, with preliminary figures showing an increasing likelihood of an outflow day due to a large exodus from the Fidelity fund, pending data from BlackRock. Multi-trillion-dollar asset manager Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC on Tuesday to launch Bitcoin and Solana ETFs. This move places the Wall Street giant alongside BlackRock and Fidelity in the crypto ETF space. According to the filing, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust is a passive investment vehicle designed to track Bitcoin’s spot price and will not use leverage or derivatives. “I like this move by them. It's smart,” opined Balchunas. “They have like $8T in advisory assets, and they already OK'd those advisors to allocate, so might as well be in their own branded fund vs paying BlackRock or someone else,” he added.

Title: Trump Admin Endorses Plan For ‘Binding’ Ukraine Security Guarantees

The U.S. on Tuesday joined a coalition of nations in committing to “binding” long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, marking the first time Washington has officially endorsed a specific security framework. The joint declaration, issued by major NATO allies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. and U.S. negotiators, followed a high-level summit in Paris aimed at solidifying post-war security arrangements for Ukraine should a ceasefire with Moscow be reached. The five-point plan includes “binding commitments” to support Ukraine against any future Russian aggression. Zelensky, who has had a turbulent relationship with Trump, met with the president at Mar-a-Lago on Dec. 28. Following that meeting, Trump signaled that the deal to end the nearly four-year war is “95%” complete, and Zelensky said the U.S. would be offering long-term security guarantees. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said after Tuesday’s Paris meeting that President Donald Trump is fully supportive of the security framework discussed by allies. “We have made significant progress on several critical workstreams, including our bilateral security guarantee framework and a prosperity plan,” Witkoff wrote on X. “We agree with the Coalition that durable security guarantees and robust prosperity commitments are essential to a lasting peace in the Ukraine and we will continue to work together on this effort.” (RELATED: Eurocrats Melt Down Over Trump Barring Censorship Police From US) Today, the US delegation met in Paris with the constituents of the Coalition of the Willing as well as the Ukrainian delegation to advance President Trump’s peace plan on Ukraine. The US delegation included Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, General Alex Grynkewich,… — Special Envoy Steve Witkoff (@SEPeaceMissions) January 6, 2026 The plan states that all parties have agreed to finalize binding commitments “setting out our approach to support Ukraine and to restore peace and security in the case of a future armed attack by Russia,” which may include “the use of military capabilities, intelligence and logistical support, diplomatic initiatives, adoption of additional sanctions.” Other elements of the plan include “critical long term military assistance and armament to the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” a “European-led” multinational peacekeeping force, as well “mutually beneficial” defense, intelligence, military training, and military cooperation with Ukraine. The draft statement also calls for a U.S.-led “ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” to “address any breaches, attribute responsibility, and determine remedies.” “We stand ready to commit to a system of politically and legally binding guarantees that will be activated once a ceasefire enters into force, in addition to bilateral security agreements and in accordance with our respective legal and constitutional arrangements,” the members agreed in the “Paris Declaration.” UK and French leaders separately signed a declaration of intent to deploy troops to monitor Ukraine if a ceasefire is reached. Representing the U.S. alongside Witkoff were Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, General Alex Grynkewich, Ambassador Charles Kushner and White House advisor Josh Gruenbaum. “I think today was a very, very big milestone,” Jared Kushner told reporters. “This does not mean that we will make peace, but peace would not be possible without the progress that was made here today.” In addition to security guarantees, Witkoff also unveiled a post-war “prosperity agreement” to rebuild Ukraine’s economy. “It will aspirationally mean large, large possibilities for the Ukrainian people, for people coming home from war who will find wonderful jobs out there. We’re working with BlackRock, Larry Fink, in this endeavor, and we think it’s going to be very, very important for the people of Ukraine, and we believe that a robust economy correlates and works directly with these security protocols,” Witkoff said. Witkoff noted, however, that land disputes with Russia remain a sticking point in reaching a ceasefire.

Title: Trump Expands Tough 'Travel Ban,' Progressives Are Weirdly Quiet
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/06/trump-expands-tough-travel-ban-progressives-are-weirdly-quiet/

President Donald Trump has expanded his regulatory curbs on migration to 39 countries, and the new rules could slash the inflow of Islamic migrants by 40 percent, according to the pro-migration Cato Institute. Yet pro-migration advocates have been almost silent about the dramatic new rules, even though they staged frenzied 2017 protests against a “Muslim travel ban” when Trump imposed softer curbs in his first year in office. For example, the National Immigration Law Center issued a mere three-sentence condemnation when the new rules were first announced. The progressive passivity is notable, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “No question, and [the 2026 rule] is much broader too,” he added. Trump’s upgraded and expanded 2026 rule even blocks the spouses and kids of legalized migrants, The silence is dramatic and important because it shows how far Trump and his voters have successfully shifted the national debate over legal and illegal migration since he was first elected in 2016. The travel curbs come after Trump basically halted illegal migration through the southern border, reversed quasi-legal status for more than one million “inadmissible” migrants, and enforced popular laws requiring the fast-track deportation of millions of illegal migrants. He has also begun slowly curbing the kick-back-generating visa programs — such as the H-1B program — that prevent skilled Americans from raising the productivity and prosperity of ordinary Americans. Forty Percent Cutback In Muslim Migration The estimate of a 40 percent cutback comes from a business-backed, pro-migration advocate at the Cato Institute, who wrote: President Trump signed a new proclamation that bans nearly all legal immigration from about 40 countries, covering about one in five legal immigrants from abroad and nearly 400,000 legal immigrants over three years. Although it exempts some foreign workers and travelers from certain countries, this ban does not include any categorical exemption or waiver for spouses, minor children, or parents of US citizens or legal permanent residents, making it far harsher than his prior bans. … Overall, one in five (19 percent) of all legal permanent immigrant visas would be affected by the ban. That includes 33 percent of African immigrants and 42 percent of legal immigrants from majority Muslim countries. The curb will slow the inflow of Muslim migrants into major U.S. cities, including New York, where Muslim migrants played a key role in defeating other ethnic groups as they elected Muslim candidate Zohran Mamdani to the mayorship last November, according to the Washington Post: “We have built a neighborhood and community here,” said [Othman] Alahlemi, a Yemeni immigrant who looked up at a flag from his native country that hangs on a street once dominated by Italian immigrants. “We are going to have a bigger space, where we can also teach our children, and Muslims from all over will be coming here.” … [Mamdami] “used the word ‘socialist’ and that meant five fundamental things — the right to food, clothing, education, health and shelter,” said [M. Anwar] Khandker, who was especially drawn to Mamdani’s pledge of universal child care. “It’s economic sense, because Islam says the same thing.” Mamdani’s win was preceded by a national wave of threatening and violent demonstrations and attacks by Muslims — and younger progressive Americans — in the United States. Those Muslim assaults were prompted by Hamas’s jihad-style murder of more than 800 Jewish civilians on October 7, 2023. Muslims in many states repeatedly say they will use migration to win more power in the United States: Many prominent business leaders have stepped back from pro-migration advocacy in the wake of the anti-Israel frenzy, political shifts in other Islamic-influenced U.S. states, and amid Trump’s reelection and reforms. The quieter elites include Larry Fink, founder of the giant BlackRock investment firm, Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook and Meta, investor David Sacks, and Palantir CEO Alex Karp. Similarly, many writers and advocates have stepped back from full-throated advocacy for migration. “A nation, fundamentally, is an exclusive club,” wrote Noah Smith, a virulently pro-migration advocate, just before the 2024 election. But Democrats should “change America’s immigration system to make it more congruent with the democratic will.” Jared Bernstein, an economic advisor to President Joe Biden, dropped any mention of migration in a New York Times article about how Democrats can reduce consumers’ costs. Even former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stated the obvious just before he died in 2023: “It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.” It is also true that many elites continue to demand more migrants, even from Islamic communities that do not try to assimilate into America’s citizenship culture of reciprocal obligations and rights. “Minnesota’s Fraud Problem Isn’t Immigrants: It’s the vast size of the welfare state that corrupts them,” the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board wrote on January 2. Moreover, some elites who want curbs on Muslim migration also demand an increase in other non-Muslim migrants. That shift would not reduce migration’s huge economic burden on ordinary Americans The muted progressive response to Trump’s curbs likely has many causes, Krikorian told Breitbart News. The administration has justified the travel curbs by carefully documenting the rate at which travelers from many countries overstay their temporary visas, he said. “The travel ban has been much better explained by giving actual visa overstay rates … the rationale has been laid out more thoroughly and in a way that’s harder to caricature.” “There are so many other things going on that [issue] lost interest” for progressives, he added: Biden was so bad [on immigration], and his defenders so humiliated themselves, that there’s a hangover where the people who are opposing [Trump’s] immigration policies are looking for the most sympathetic cases to complain about, rather than more abstract policy issues … they’re chastened to some degree, but I don’t think they’ve changed their thinking. The evidence of a progressive rethink is thin, he said, adding “Here’s hoping, but I’m skeptical, and I’ll believe it when I see it.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Witkoff, Kushner ink 5-point plan in Paris on Ukraine security guarantees

Full Content:
WASHINGTON — President Trump’s peace envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner signed onto a five-point plan with European leaders in Paris Tuesday to enhance “security guarantees” for Ukraine if it reaches terms to end Russia’s nearly four-year invasion. The joint statement by major NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is vague on some details but represents a step forward, including specifying a “US-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism” that would “address any breaches, attribute responsibility, and determine remedies.” Other points pledge “critical long term military assistance” to Kyiv, a “European-led” multinational peacekeeping force, additional military aid and sanctions in the “case of a future armed attack by Russia,” as well as “mutually beneficial defence [sic] cooperation with Ukraine.” Key points remain unresolved, including Zelensky’s recent proposal for both Ukrainian and Russian forces to withdraw from frontlines in order to establish a demilitarized zone — as an alternative to agreeing to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand that Ukraine cede the north of Donetsk province. UK and French leaders separately firmed up their offer to dispatch troops to monitor the frontlines if a cease-fire is reached. Witkoff said in a statement that he and Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, would have further talks with Zelensky on Tuesday night and into Wednesday — teasing business pledges to rebuild Ukraine. “We think we’re largely finished with security protocols, which are important so that the people of Ukraine know that when this ends, it ends forever,” Witkoff said at a press conference alongside Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chanceller Friedrich Merz. “We also think critically that we are very, very close to finishing up as robust a prosperity agreement as any country has ever seen coming out of conflicts like this,” Witkoff said. “It will aspirationally mean large, large possibilities for the Ukrainian people, for people coming home from war who will find wonderful jobs out there. We’re working with BlackRock, Larry Fink, in this endeavor, and we think it’s going to be very, very important for the people of Ukraine, and we believe that a robust economy correlates and works directly with these security protocols.” Witkoff said that resolving land disputes with Russia remains a sticking point. “We heard President Zelensky and some of the other people here talking about land options. That will be the most critical issue,” he said. “And we’re going to be continuing with those discussions, and hopefully we’ll be able to meet or come up with certain compromises with regard to that.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Witkoff said the security framework discussed Tuesday was “meant to A) deter any attacks, any further attacks in Ukraine, and B) if there are any attacks, they’re meant to defend, and they will do both. They are as strong as anyone has ever seen… [Trump] does not back down from his commitments.” President Trump has sought to cajole Zelensky and Putin to reach a peace agreement throughout his first year back in power and has grown frustrated at points. Zelensky met with Trump on Dec. 28 at the president’s Palm Beach, Fla., residence — with Trump saying he was again optimistic. “You can say 95 percent, but I don’t like to say percentages. I just think we’re doing very well,” Trump said. “We could be very close. There are one or two very thorny issues, very tough issues. But I think we’re doing very well.” Advertisement

(REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz) Fred Lucas / @FredLucasWH Fred Lucas is chief news correspondent and manager of the Investigative Reporting Project for The Daily Signal. He is the author of “The Myth of Voter Suppression: The Left’s Assault on Clean Elections.” Send an email to Fred. FIRST ON THE DAILY SIGNAL – The Securities and Exchange Commission could make it tougher for shareholders to challenge left-leaning corporate policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as environmental issues, a conservative watchdog group asserts. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins in November suggested making it easier for corporations to block shareholder proposals from being heard and voted on at annual shareholder meetings. Atkins, appointed by President Donald Trump in January and confirmed by the Senate in April, also suggested allowing the state where a company is based to decide what is appropriate for shareholder consideration. However, in a 10-page letter to Atkins shared with The Daily Signal, National Legal and Policy Center President Peter Flaherty argued that conservatives have successfully challenged DEI, and ESG–short for environment, social governance–policies at large, publicly traded companies. Atkins’ proposals could remove the very tools conservatives used to stop these policies, he added. “We share your concerns about the proliferation of proposals that appear to advance irrelevant ideological agendas. However, the solution cannot be to dismantle the mechanism itself,” Flaherty wrote. Specifically at issue is SEC Rule 14a-8, which is the mechanism for shareholders to submit proposals for a publicly traded company’s annual meeting. The rule also includes guidelines for a company to exclude the proposal from the annual meeting if it is determined irrelevant to the company’s business. Flaherty described the shareholder process as “an explicitly capitalist institution” when “properly constrained.”“It is voluntary, firm-specific, and mediated by the discipline of capital markets,” he wrote. Flaherty warned that the proposed changes to thwart more shareholder proposals would weaken the rights of ordinary investors and could effectively entrench the power of large investment institutions such as BlackRock. The National Legal and Policy Center has pointed to recent conservative victories in pushing corporations such as Target and Cracker Barrel to abandon leftist policies. Numerous other companies rolled back DEI policies in 2024 and 2025, according to Forbes. The policy change floated would also affect shareholder proposals coming from the left. Yet Flaherty argued that corporate managers are still largely inclined to push these policies, and shareholders need a tool to push back. “When Chairman Atkins suppresses the dissent of shareholders and makes corporate managers less accountable, he is not supporting our side,” Flaherty told The Daily Signal. “The managerial class is overwhelmingly liberal. They know each other, went to the same schools, and serve on each other’s boards.” “Taking on DEI, ESG, and stopping debanking are all part of the president’s agenda,” Flaherty added. “It’s a shame [Atkins] is undercutting our efforts.” In a speech at the University of Delaware in October, Atkins also suggested a shareholder proposal might not be proper for consideration if it isn’t permissible under state law. “State law governs whether a proposal is a ‘proper subject,’” Atkins said, adding that “it is appropriate for the agency to defer to those who practice Delaware law” to determine whether a proposal could be considered there. Then on Nov. 17, the SEC announced a policy change whereby it would acknowledge a company’s intent to exclude shareholder proposals, but would not make a ruling on it. Conservative watchdogs like Flaherty consider that effectively a rubber stamp for the company and a departure from the past, when the shareholder and company would submit legal arguments to exclude proposals and the SEC would decide. Audrey Barr, senior communications advisor for the SEC, declined to comment on the issues raised by Flaherty. Flaherty noted in the letter that providing more deference to states could give the state of Delaware enhanced influence, since so many companies are incorporated in the state. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Martin and Xi say they read it as teens - but what is The Gadfly and who is its Cork-born author?

THE TAOISEACH’S MEETING with China President Xi Jinping yesterday threw up a surprise: it turns out the Chinese leader says he is a fan of an Irish novel. Xi credited the 1897 book The Gadfly – by Cork-born author Ethel Voynich – as sustaining him during his traumatic teenage years when his family suffered under a purge by the Communist Party leadership. Micheál Martin told Irish media yesterday that he and Xi found the book was common ground during his visit to Beijing, as the Fianna Fáil leader had also read it when he was a teenager. “It was unusual that we ended up discussing The Gadfly and its impact on both of us, but there you are,” Martin said. As a boy, Xi found himself cast out of any comforts enjoyed by his family after his father fell foul during a purge of supposed internal rivals by party leader Mao Zedong, with the future president reportedly having to sleep in a cave at points during his exile. However, what’s arguably more surprising about Xi’s recall of the book is that it didn’t come as all that much of a surprise to some observers. This is because The Gadfly carries a different weight depending on where you are in the world – having sold over 5 million copies in the Soviet Union alone. According to historian Donal Fallon, its author Voynich is one of a number of Irish writers who enjoyed broader readerships in the likes of China and the Soviet Union than you might first expect. “The Gadfly found its audience in different continents, not least China, and even finding an English language copy was sometimes tricky in the past,” Fallon told The Journal. Advertisement While it has remained little known to a general Irish audience, it did find itself cited by leftists at home as well as abroad – partly because of their educational value to socialists as much as their literary merit was. “The Gadfly also gets mention in the memoir of Peadar O’Donnell, Anti-Treaty Republican, who recalled ‘the Gadfly was being widely read in C Wing: It is a tale of Italian revolution with a ghastly execution scene’,” Fallon added, referring to O’Donnell’s time in prison in Ireland. A copy of the book. File photo Alamy Alamy The book follows a young Englishman who goes to 1840s Italy to study to become a priest but finds himself caught up in the radical politics of the era, while also navigating a relationship with another revolutionary. Born in 1864 in Blackrock in Cork as Ethel Lilian Boole, her family moved to Lancashire, England after her mathematician father George Boole died when she was an infant. (Boole’s name adorns a well-known building used to this day by students on the campus of University College Cork) Voynich was in her early 30s when The Gadfly was published, with speculation that it may have been partly inspired by her own involvement with similar revolutionaries. Historian Maurice Casey described Voynich to The Journal as a “one-woman node in a global network” in her own era, with her book’s citing by China’s leader speaking to Ireland’s global cultural influence. “Her comrades included Ukrainian and Russian socialists – and she married a Polish political exile,” said Casey, whose 2024 book Hotel Lux looked at the forgotten Irish radicals and their lives and loves in Russia during the rise of socialism. Casey added that for the book to arise in the exchange between Martin and Xi – both whom recalling reading it as teenagers – is a way of reminding us that The Gadfly’s success “lay in Voynich’s ability to portray common experiences of a revolutionary life”. This ranged from commitment to a cause, to sacrifice and even romance, Casey said, all features that may well have bolstered the nineteenth century novel’s appeal to any young person with an interest in politics, “whether surviving the Cultural Revolution in China or a teenager in Cork city during the 1970s”.

If you ask Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for its Americas division, the answer is yes — at least for now. For decades, bonds have acted as a buffer for the volatility of investors' stock positions. Your stock allocation would handle the growth, while the bond allocation would play defense by locking in a steady return and promising the chance to sell for a profit if the stock market went through a rough patch. An allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a cornerstone of portfolio construction. But in 2022, the strategy didn't work. Inflation soared, causing the Federal Reserve to hike rates, torpedoing stocks. At the same time, long-term bond yields rose to match inflation expectations, crushing the value of bonds bought at lower interest rates. In other words, stocks and bonds sold off simultaneously, leaving portfolios in tatters. The same thing happened in early 2025. As President Donald Trump launched an ambitious trade war, rising inflation concerns pushed up bond yields and tanked stocks. Morningstar pointed out that it was the worst stretch for the 60/40 in 150 years. Every time William publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. However, those days should be behind us now, Chaudhuri says. While she's bullish on the equity market in 2026, investors should once again be able to count on bonds as a hedge if things don't work out for stocks. "If we do see a shock, we think bonds can be that protection or that balance," Chaudhuri told Business Insider on Monday. One reason for that is that interest rates are starting the year higher than they were in 2022, giving them room to move lower. The Fed is also slashing interest rates, whereas it had been hiking them a few years ago. This has pushed the correlation between stocks and long-end bonds back into negative territory, where they move in different directions. As for where to put your money in the bond market, Chaudhuri said she likes the middle of the yield curve, where investors can still find attractive yields without having to necessarily take on the duration risk associated with the longer end of the curve. "We do think if you are allocated to that five-year part of the yield curve or even that 10-year part of the yield curve, you do have that negative correlation that's coming back, which we think can be a big difference, especially from previous sell-offs like in 2022 and 2025, she said. Meanwhile, in stocks, Chaudhuri said the value factor is attractive. "We don't think this is the end of the AI trade by any means, but one way in which we're talking about things a little differently in 2026 is there are opportunities beyond AI," Chaudhuri said. She continued: "If you just look at a stand alone basis of what you're getting in terms of earnings growth in that value sector, you're getting about a 12% expectation in earnings growth." Examples of funds that offer exposure to the trades above include the Schwab Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury ETF (SCHR), the iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEI), the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV), and the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor ETF (VLUE).

Telegram’s H1 2025 revenue climbed 65% to $870 million, while Toncoin write-downs and $500 million in frozen bonds have added pressure. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan. 6, 1:20 pm UTC): This article has been updated with a statement from Telegram. Cryptocurrency-friendly messenger Telegram boosted its operating revenue in 2025 as it explores a potential initial public offering (IPO). Telegram’s revenues hit $870 million in the first half of 2025, up 65% from $525 million a year earlier, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unaudited financial statements. About a third of that, or $300 million, came from “exclusivity agreements,” linked to earnings related to Telegram-connected cryptocurrency Toncoin (TON). The report also said that $500 million of Telegram’s bonds have been frozen in Russia’s central securities depository due to Western sanctions, the FT said, citing anonymous sources. Telegram posted a net loss of more than $220 million in H1 2025, compared with a $334 net profit in the first half of the previous year. The company targets $2 billion in revenue in 2025. The loss reportedly came from Telegram having to write down the value of its holdings in Toncoin, which lost 69% of its value in 2025, according to CoinGecko. “The company told investors it had sold more than $450 million in Toncoin in the year to date,” the report said. By publishing time, the amount would account for about 10% of TON’s market capitalization of $4.6 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Addressing the bond freeze in Russia, a spokesperson for Telegram said that $500 million figure refers to a bond issue from 2021. The representative noted that Telegram’s latest bond offering in 2025 excluded participation by Russian investors. “Telegram is not dependent on Russia or Russian capital and does not face bond-related issues due to sanctions,” the spokesperson said, adding: Telegram launched several bond offerings in recent years, including a $1.7 billion convertible bond offering issued in May 2025. The sale reportedly featured existing backers, including investment giant BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala. According to FT sources, Telegram bought back most of the bonds maturing in 2026. Related: ‘Mixed year for IPOs’ as crypto pulls down US IPO performance The report comes amid Telegram CEO Pavel Durov remaining under formal investigation in France over the platform’s alleged failure to address criminality, including child abuse content. In a recent call with some bondholders, Telegram reportedly said it continued to cooperate with authorities regarding Durov’s case and that it needed more resolution before the company could proceed with a public market listing. Cointelegraph also sought comment from Telegram on its 2025 financials and TON holdings, but the company did not address either in its response.

Title: Morgan Stanley files S-1s for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs in latest crypto push

The investment banking giant’s filings for Bitcoin and Solana ETFs follow an uptick in investor demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles, driven by the new year’s “clean-slate” effect. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update Jan. 6, 12:57 p.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include a paragraph on Morgan Stanley’s prior involvement with cryptocurrency funds. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), one tied to Bitcoin and the other to Solana, as Wall Street firms push deeper into regulated digital-asset products. The proposed Morgan Stanley Bitcoin (BTC) Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana (SOL) Trust will function as “passive investment” vehicles that hold and track the performance of the underlying tokens, according to Tuesday’s filings with the SEC. The two funds seek to list their shares on public exchanges, which are usually specified in later 19b-4 filings, not the initial S-1 forms. If approved, the funds could bring new inflows to Bitcoin and Solana from Morgan Stanley’s over 19 million clients served through its wealth management division as of April 2025, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.1 billion in inflows during the first two trading days of 2026, as analysts pointed to renewed digital asset appetite due to the new year’s “clean-slate effect.” Related: Strategy kickstarts 2026 with $116M Bitcoin buy as Q4 paper loss hits $17B Morgan Stanley Investment Management is listed as the sponsor for both proposed trusts. CSC Delaware Trust Company is named as the Delaware trustee. Key service providers, including certain custodial arrangements, were not fully specified in the preliminary documents. Morgan Stanley said it will keep a “substantial portion of the private keys” in cold storage with a “remainder” held in hot wallets. The two funds won’t seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of the underlying asset, meaning that the sponsor won’t “speculatively sell” the spot tokens. Morgan Stanley has been deepening its involvement with the cryptocurrency industry along with other big financial institutions. In October, the wealth manager reportedly enabled its financial advisors to recommend crypto funds to clients with individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k)s, marking a significant policy shift from previously restricting access to high-net-worth individuals with over $1.5 million in assets.

It comes a day after the second-largest US bank, Bank of America, began allowing advisers in its wealth management businesses to recommend exposure to four Bitcoin ETFs, Cointelegraph reported on Monday. The move allows the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which can now be recommended by the bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers across its Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients in December 2025, a year after BlackRock recommended an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, as the first large financial institution to do so, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024.

What changed in the first week of 2026? Institutional capital is coming back, and it’s largely going through BlackRock. Following a choppy Q4 in 2025, where ETF volumes struggled to find a floor, the first week of 2026 has delivered a massive liquidity injection. On-chain data and fund flows confirm that BlackRock clients have snapped up 3,948 Bitcoin [BTC] worth $371.89 million and 31,737 Ethereum [ETH] worth $100.23 million. This signals that institutions don’t drop half a billion dollars unless they expect the market to strengthen. In fact, this kind of synchronized BTC + ETH accumulation often happens when institutions expect higher prices soon. On the ETF front, the 5th of January marked a rebound for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Data from Farside Investors shows an extraordinary $697.2 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows in a single day. BlackRock’s IBIT alone accounted for $372.5 million, over half of all inflows. Meanwhile, its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, secured $102.9 million out of the sector’s $168 million total. This surge in capital coincided with a broader market recovery, pushing Bitcoin to $93,700.64 and Ethereum to $3,234.78. At the same time, corporate holders are also signaling renewed confidence. Strategy, despite suffering a steep 43% stock decline during the 2025 crypto downturn, remains the world’s largest public Bitcoin treasury with over 673,783 BTC. In fact, on the 4th of January, Michael Saylor reignited speculation when he hinted at further Bitcoin accumulation on X. Yet perhaps the most transformative development comes from Grayscale. On the 5th of January, the firm announced the first-ever U.S. spot crypto ETP payout derived from staking rewards for its Ethereum Staking ETF (ETHE). Investors received $0.083178 per share, with the distribution covering rewards accrued from October to December 2025. This introduces passive income to Ethereum holders within traditional brokerage accounts, shifting ETH from a purely speculative asset to a yield-generating one. These developments follow a dramatic year-end contrast between two of the market’s biggest players. During the holiday slowdown, BlackRock quietly shifted $214 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime to manage ETF redemptions. Meanwhile, on the other hand, Saylor’s Strategy moved in the opposite direction. On the same day, Strategy purchased 1,229 BTC worth $108.85 million, boosting its holdings to 672,497 BTC. All this combined signals that the weak hands are exiting and the strongest hands are accumulating, setting the tone for what may come next in 2026.

Title: XRP Surges Towards $2.20: Leading Monday Gains And Driving Crypto ETF Inflows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In 2025, XRP emerged as the best-performing token among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies, outpacing gains from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As the first week of 2026 unfolds, XRP has continued this upward trend, recording a 17% surge over the past week that has propelled its price back above the key $2.20 threshold. One of the prominent factors contributing to this surge is the strong performance of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which became a standout in the market by attracting $483 million over the past weeks. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant outflow of $1.09 billion, while Ethereum products faced a loss of $564 million. XRP funds not only achieved $483 million in inflows during December but also maintained a steady influx for 30 consecutive trading days. This streak finally ended on December 26 with the first day of zero inflows. Overall, since their launch in November, total inflows into XRP exchange-traded funds have amassed to $1.3 billion, marking the fastest adoption rate for any altcoin ETF to date. Looking ahead, reports suggest that the ETF landscape could be pivotal in shaping bullish scenarios for XRP. A potential filing by BlackRock for an XRP ETF could serve as a significant credibility boost, attracting conservative institutional investors to the space. BlackRock’s own $40 billion Bitcoin ETF exemplifies the capacity to mobilize capital effectively through its Aladdin platform connections. Additionally, the scaling of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin into banking and remittance services could generate ongoing demand for XRP as a critical bridge asset. There are also signs that the Federal Reserve could implement several rate cuts in 2026, which would lower the opportunity cost of investing in risk assets. Under such conditions, it is alleged that the XRP price might break through its all-time high of $3.84, potentially escalating toward the $4.00 to $5.00 range by year-end. When it comes to price action, market analyst Dark Defender, active on the social media platform X (previously Twitter), recently highlighted XRP’s price action by providing a three-month time frame update. The analyst noted that a newly initiated green candle in January exhibits a bullish Relative Strength Index (RSI). According to Dark Defender, surpassing the $2.22 level is crucial for XRP. He further suggested that XRP could be on the brink of a significant surge, similar to silver, and pointed to ambitious targets such as $6 and even as high as $20 in the future. Achieving $6 would represent a notable 171% increase from current trading prices, while reaching the $20 mark would indicate a staggering 800% rise. While trading at $2.21 at the time of writing, the token is still facing $2.22 as the next major short-term resistance level, and is also trading at 40% below its all-time high.

Title: Ice warning may cause further disruption as cold snap continues

A fresh weather warning for icy conditions in Northern Ireland has come into force as the cold snap continues to cause disruption. More than 200 schools in Northern Ireland were closed on Tuesday and a number of Translink services were affected. The police warned that some roads in County Fermanagh were "impassable due to treacherous icy conditions" including Moybrone Road, Letterbreen and Tiravally Road, and Florencecourt. A yellow weather warning for ice ended at 10:00 GMT on Tuesday but a new one is in place from 18:00 until 11:00 on Wednesday. A fresh dusting of snow can also be expected in some areas. The Met Office has urged the public to take care on slippery footpaths and untreated roads. Tuesday's school closures were mainly in the north east, north west and west of Northern Ireland. Three schools in Northern Ireland are due to be closed on Wednesday. Bin collections in various council areas have been disrupted by the weather. In Derry and Strabane District Council all cemeteries remain closed on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Recycling centres there have reopened, with the exception of Spamont and Park. Sports pitches at Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council remain closed. Donemana sheep farmer Matthew Craig said it had been difficult to get about to feed his animals in recent days. "It's really been like an ice rink," he said. Craig is also balancing childcare and farming as daughters Anna and Beth have been off school, while their mum has been working. Brian Guthrie, the principal of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, had hoped to reopen on Tuesday but conditions did not allow it. "I spent a good bit of time on site yesterday, clearing pathways and so on to make it safe but, unfortunately, as the day went on it seemed more and more schools were making a call to close," he told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. He said the Foyle Learning Community – a network of 13 schools, which includes Foyle College – made a decision to close, so he was left with no choice but to do the same. "It isn't an easy decision and I know it has an impact on parents, the children and learning and apologies for that but it's really about making sure our school community is safe." Emma Tsang has three children and lives in the Ballymoney area. A number of local schools were closed, including those attended by her children, as well as their childcare facility. Tsang said she respected the decision to close schools, as the safety of children and staff is paramount, but added it was "not ideal". "It's a difficult situation for working parents to organise alternative childcare at short notice," she said. St Brigid's Primary School in Tirkane in County Londonderry was among the closed schools. Its principal Ursula O'Hanlon said the snow and ice had not thawed, adding that she could not expect parents to get children to school when buses were not servicing local roads. "Nobody wants to be responsible for opening a school and hearing then that someone had an accident," she said. Paddy Lavery, a principal engineer at the Department of Infrastructure, said there were more than 300 staff members working to keep the main roads open and safe. Lavery said rural schools will always be a "difficulty" but there are special arrangements to treat some roads. They follow a scoring mechanism to decide where resources will be deployed. This includes assessing whether there has been a history of snow and ice around the school, if there is a bus with over 40 seats travelling to the school and the number of vehicles travelling to the school. Lavery said there is an application process for rural roads to be treated, adding that over 50 schools are treated under special arrangements. Hospital entrances are also treated under these arrangements. Scarlett,10, Alesha, 6, and Dan, 8, were playing in the snow in Cullybackey. "Well what I love about the snow is that I can get it and throw it at him [Dan]," Scarlett told BBC News NI. She added that they had sleighs at their granny's house which is "the best thing". Dan said he likes to throw snowballs at his sister and "push her down in the snow because I know she won't get hurt". Their father, Steven, said the children are "having a lot of fun" but they do love school. In County Down, the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team was deployed to help health workers and carers make essential calls to patients' homes. Volunteers used 4x4 rescue vehicles to transport carers to houses that are difficult to reach in icy weather. "A lot of the side roads and laneways and so on have become very treacherous," said Martin McMullan from the team. "There's obviously a lot of people living in our community now, particularly in the rural community, with quite acute care needs - not just the elderly." Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Older People, Siobhan Casey, called on people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the cold snap. NI Water urged people to be careful around its outdoor sites, particularly reservoirs and dams, where winter conditions can create hazards. Reservoir safety and compliance area manager Derek McKane said ice was "nearly always treacherous" and people should not attempt to walk or skate on iced-over reservoirs. "Reservoirs are not safe places to play at any time of year, but winter brings extra dangers," he added. The Met Office issues yellow warnings for snow and ice across much of the country for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The crew were treating a route at Wigmore on Thursday when the lorry had to take "evasive action". Aberdeenshire teenager Jamie Monaghan has been working day and night on his dad's gritter lorry during Scotland's big freeze. A gust of 99mph is recorded in the Isles of Scilly as the storm brings heavy snow and rain to the UK. Some train services are cancelled causing delays. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Chinese EV maker BYD pulls ahead as Tesla sales slump

Chinese automaker BYD reported a nearly 28% increase in December sales, with total 2025 deliveries (BEVs and plug-in hybrids) reaching 4.6 million vehicles, while Tesla's 2026 projected sales are 1.6 millionÂ â down from 1.79 million in 2024. BYD offers a wide range of vehicles, including compact cars, sedans, SUVs, buses and commercial EVs, whereas Tesla's lineup is limited to the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck (with future models not yet mainstream). Analysts link Teslaâs sales decline partly to Elon Musk's political engagement, including controversial statements on European politics, immigration and diversity following his acquisition of X (formerly Twitter). A Yale University study estimated Teslaâs sales could have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding 1â1.26 million vehicles. Musk's actions reportedly boosted sales of rival electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market.

Once the benchmark for EV innovation, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding product range and strong sales growth are reshaping the global electric vehicle market. The global electric vehicle (EV) market appears to be tilting in favor of Chinese automaker BYD, as Tesla struggles to maintain its once-dominant position. Tesla sold an estimated 480,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the third quarter of 2025 and around 400,000 in the fourth quarter. Total sales for 2026 are projected at 1.6 million units, down from approximately 1.79 million in 2024. In contrast, BYD sold roughly 1.7 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in 2024 and around 2.25 million in 2025, with total deliveries, including BEVs and plug-in hybrids, reaching 4.6 million vehicles in 2025. BYD, as per BrightU.AI's Enoch, is a Chinese multinational automotive manufacturer established in 1995. It initially focused on battery production before expanding intoÂ EVs and plug-in hybrids. BYD's diverse lineup includes compact city cars, premium sedans, large SUVs, hybrid models and electric buses and commercial vehicles, giving it a broad presence in markets worldwide. Meanwhile, Tesla's current portfolio consists of the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck in limited volumes, with vehicles like the Roadster and low-cost robotaxi-style EVs not yet available to mainstream buyers. Analysts: Musk's politics cost Tesla over a million sales Analysts suggest that Tesla's sales underperformance is partly linked to founder Elon Musk's high-profile political activities. Following his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk increasingly voiced opinions on European politics, immigration and diversity initiatives, drawing criticism and controversy. A Yale University study published in October found that Tesla's sales would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding one million to 1.26 million vehicles sold. The study also concluded that Musk's actions boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%. "This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be," the researchers wrote. "We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business." Musk further amplified his political engagement by backing President Donald Trump and Republican causes, including a reported $288 million contribution to Trump-aligned committees during the 2024 election cycle. After Trump's return to office, Musk was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Once regarded as the benchmark for cutting-edge EV technology and environmental progress, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding range and consistent sales growth highlight the shifting dynamics of the global electric vehicle market.

Musk further amplified his political engagement by backing President Donald Trump and Republican causes, including a reported $288 million contribution to Trump-aligned committees during the 2024 election cycle. After Trump's return to office, Musk was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which oversaw the dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Once regarded as the benchmark for cutting-edge EV technology and environmental progress, Tesla now faces growing competition from BYD, whose expanding range and consistent sales growth highlight the shifting dynamics of the global electric vehicle market. Watch JD Rucker discussing how BlackRock â which owns nearly two percent of BYD â is helping China own the American EV market. This video is from the JD Rucker channel onÂ Brighteon.com. Sources include: Finance.Yahoo.com CBSNews.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com BYD, as per BrightU.AI's Enoch, is a Chinese multinational automotive manufacturer established in 1995. It initially focused on battery production before expanding intoÂ EVs and plug-in hybrids. BYD's diverse lineup includes compact city cars, premium sedans, large SUVs, hybrid models and electric buses and commercial vehicles, giving it a broad presence in markets worldwide. Meanwhile, Tesla's current portfolio consists of the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and the Cybertruck in limited volumes, with vehicles like the Roadster and low-cost robotaxi-style EVs not yet available to mainstream buyers. Analysts: Musk's politics cost Tesla over a million sales Analysts suggest that Tesla's sales underperformance is partly linked to founder Elon Musk's high-profile political activities. Following his $44 billion acquisition of X, formerly known as Twitter, in 2022, Musk increasingly voiced opinions on European politics, immigration and diversity initiatives, drawing criticism and controversy. A Yale University study published in October found that Tesla's sales would have been 67% to 83% higher without Musk's political involvement, potentially adding one million to 1.26 million vehicles sold. The study also concluded that Musk's actions boosted sales of other electric and hybrid vehicles by 17% to 22%.
