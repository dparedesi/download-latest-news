Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. It was a stellar year for investors here and abroad, with some stand-out stocks on our market as interest rate cuts start to relieve some economic pressure. In January, the Herald asked professional stock pickers which companies they were backing on the New Zealand, Australia and US stock markets. This article reveals how their picks performed in the year to December, and the stocks they’re picking for 2025. Scroll to the end to see a graphic of all the results and picks. It was a year of two halves for our share market with almost all of the gains coming after interest rates were cut, although economic challenges saw many companies dim their lights this year, including some notable names. Spark suffered under the weight of reduced corporate and Government spending, but its loss was Infratil’s gain as the owner of One NZ saw its early data centre bets pay off. Surprisingly, stock brokers remain committed to some of the poorest performers, such as retirement village operator Ryman Healthcare, with optimism that interest rate cuts may finally result in improved finances, especially in an industry tied to the housing market. Energy was a consistent pick for the new year, with Contact and Mercury specifically in sight, after a crisis period that made electricity generation’s importance clear. Firms were increasingly investing in companies offshore, with some firms' picks for 2025 allocated entirely internationally where they could get more exposure to technology. “The global economy is expected to grow at around 3% in 2025, with inflation continuing to normalise after the highs of recent years,” Hamilton Hindin Green investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “However, growth may be uneven across regions due to varying impacts of tariff and immigration policies, particularly in the US and China. “Despite these challenges, the ongoing recovery and advancements in technology offer significant opportunities for growth and development. Retirement village operator Summerset was a favourite for the new year, following its outperformance in 2024. The company made a total shareholder return of 26.6% in the year to December 9, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs Investment Partner’s head of private wealth research Hamish Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Infratil was another crowd favourite for a repeated year with firms expecting it could keep building on top of this year’s 23.3% total return and its addition to the MSCI World Index. “The demand for and valuation of data centres is central to Infratil’s positive outlook,” Nikko Asset Management’s head of New Zealand equities Michael Shrerrock said. “Furthermore, should Contact’s takeover of Manawa Energy be approved by [the] Commerce Commission, then Infratil will receive Contact shares and cash for its Manawa holding.” Nikko and Forsyth Barr both had Contact on their lists for the new year, after it added more geothermal generation to its portfolio. “Contact Energy trades at a significant discount to Mercury and Meridian Energy and offers similar or better earnings growth.” Forsyth Barr senior equities analyst Aaron Ibbotson said. Although, Salt Funds was picking Mercury as its power play, purely because it was priced cheap. “Occasionally, the forced idiocy of passive funds gives active investors a free hit in large cap stocks,” Salt’s managing director Matt Goodson said. Stock broking firm Hamilton Hindin Greene picked only international stocks for 2025, with United States household names Walmart and BlackRock among its picks. “Walmart had a strong fiscal year 2024, with a 6% increase in revenue to US$648.1 billion,” Investment adviser Jeremy Sulllivan said. “The company also saw significant growth in its eCommerce sales, which surpassed $100 billion for the year.” Hamilton Hindin Greene’s Australian-listed picks included Xero and WiseTech Global. “Xero’s focus on expanding its subscriber base and enhancing its product offerings, particularly in the US market, is expected to drive growth,” Sullivan said. Some of the firms also had an international technology play in their investment line-up, including Amazon and Uber. The well-known ride-share app “getting good traction with its loyalty scheme and with selling advertising, which is very profitable,” Forsyth Barr’s Ibbotson explained. Getting the bad news out of the way first, Spark and Ryman Healthcare turned out to be poor performers, despite some firms backing them at the outset of 2024. The telecommunications company Spark was deemed somewhat defensive in an economic downturn, however, it had suffered more than stock pickers expected, with its share price hitting its lowest level since 2015 this year. Spark’s total shareholder return for the year to December 9 was -40.2%, including its share price fall buffered by any dividends paid, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “It’s fair to say that Spark surprised and disappointed the market with its poor earnings result,” Nikko Asset Management’s Michael Sherrock said of its early 2024 pick. “Its removal from the MSCI World Index, which forced a significant sell down of stock, further weakened its share price.” The company recently sold the rest of its cell tower infrastructure business and announced an earnings and dividend downgrade. “The board and management acknowledge that our current financial performance falls short of what is acceptable, and we understand the disappointment our shareholders will be feeling,” Spark chairwoman Justine Smyth said in October. However, two analysts have since upgraded their rating on Spark’s stock, suggesting it could be oversold. On a similar note, retirement village developer and operator Ryman’s total return for the year to December was -28.8%, making it among one of the worst performing on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) this year. Chairman Dean Hamilton recently announced a near halving in its half-year net profit and rising vacancies across its properties. Its struggles speak to the housing-tied difficulties more broadly, where higher interest rates may still be having an impact, but much of Ryman’s problems were its own doing, as Hamilton explained to the Herald in June. “The financial performance has slowly deteriorated,” the chairman said. “A bit like being in a boiling pot and then when you look at it five years later you go, ‘how did the business get to this position?’” It surprised stock pickers at Forsyth Barr who were backing the company to be one of the best performing this year as interest rates were expected to come down. “We believe Ryman to be the most attractive mid to large-cap opportunity in New Zealand over the coming 12 months,” Forsyth Barr senior equity analyst Aaron Ibbotson said in January. One month after making that statement, the company raised $902 million from investors to help repay debt, followed by its chief executive resigning. In Ibbotson’s defence, he was sticking with the stock for 2025. Another of Forsyth Barr’s picks did not play out as hoped, with AFT Pharmaceuticals making a -18.2% total return in the year. The Maxigesic pain-relief producer announced a significant operating profit downgrade in November. Hamilton Hindin Greene’s own property pick played out poorly - Vital Healthcare, which owns medical properties such as private hospitals, made a -12.1% total return. “Despite a solid dividend yield of 6.42%, the stock’s capital value declined,” Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “The company focused on divesting non-core assets and reinvesting in new developments, which, while strategically sound, impacted short-term performance.” Sky Television was among the favourites for both Craigs and Nikko Asset, who liked it because of its dividend payout potential. While the media company did pay a solid dividend, it failed to help the share price, finishing the year to December with a total return of just 0.2%. “Sky has not been immune to a weak economy, and has bounced around over the year a bit like a rugby ball,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. “Sky Network Television has been a disappointing pick,” Craigs’ Hamish Don said. “In August, the company reported slightly lower-than-expected profit and tempered investor expectations by reducing its revenue guidance.” Both raised investor concerns about renewing expensive New Zealand rugby rights going forward, although they both believed its decent dividend of 30 cents per share next year was attractive. “We continue to see value in Sky Network Television,” Don said. Nikko was sticking with Sky as a top pick for 2025. Despite Ryman’s woes, a competing retirement village developer was one of the best performing picks for the year. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs’ Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Both Craigs and Nikko cited official interest rate cuts as benefiting the company’s position. “These rate cuts oil the wheels of the housing market, increasing turnover, and making it easier for retirees to sell up and move into retirement villages, therefore stock sentiment continues to improve,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. Infratil was the most shared pick for the year and played out as expected with a 23.3% total return, largely due to a higher revaluation of its CDC data centres investment. “Although, CDC didn’t catch quite the degree of euphoria and hype that propelled some other data centre names around the world,” Salt Funds Management’s Matt Goodson said of his team’s pick. In comparison to Spark, Infratil, which owns the telecommunications company One New Zealand, was added to the MSCI World index, which resulted in a large amount of stock buying. Salt Funds was the best-performing stock picker of the year, with its backing of insurer Tower, which managed to hike premiums on the back of a tough period of claim volumes following Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding events. Tower’s total return came in at 127.8% in 2024, making it a market stand out. “Tower played out as well as we could have hoped with a very supportive insurance cycle for the first time in years,” Goodson said. “Having no major [weather] events was a piece of overdue luck. “We still see Tower as being cheap. Premium growth will be a lot slower from here, but they have a number of growth levers and the market still values them as though they get hit by their full retained exposure to large disasters each and every year forever.” Salt’s outperformance was also bolstered by its Freightways pick, which made a total return of 27.8%, “despite the hideously weak NZ economy," Goodson said. “October onwards has been a lot better for many cyclical companies as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand reverses its earlier over-tightening.” Salt was continuing to back Freightways in 2025. Another benefiter of interest rate cuts was Contact Energy, which made a bullish $1.86 billion takeover offer for retail power player Manawa and opened its new geothermal station outside of Taupō in the year. The power player was picked by both Craigs and Nikko Asset this year, and Nikko and Forsyth Barr had it as a top pick for 2025. “Performance has been supported by solid customer demand and sales channel options, confirmation that the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter will keep operating for a further 20 years, and the RBNZ lowering the Official Cash Rate,” Craigs’ Don said. On its potential Manawa purchase which was yet to be approved, Don said: “The generation assets of these businesses are complementary and we think there is a high probability the Commerce Commission will approve the transaction.” Forsyth Barr’s best pick for the year turned out to be a2 Milk, which by mid-year was the best performing stock on the NZX. It defied concerns of the impact a declining birth rate in China could have on its infant formula product, and was now sitting on $1b in cash and looking to pay a dividend for the first time in its 20-year history. Hamilton Hindin Greene made a bold bet on the market itself in 2024, picking the NZX to be a stand out - and it was. “The company’s revenue and net income saw significant growth, driven by increased trading volumes and new product offerings,” Jeremy Sullivan said. “This strong financial performance was reflected in the substantial capital appreciation and a healthy dividend yield.” In total, the NZX Top 50 index was sitting 9.7% higher by mid-December, on par with Australia’s Top 200 index, but well below the major US market, the S&P500, which had returned 27% year to date by December. The offshore outperformance in 2024 paid off for investors with international exposure, especially for those in technology stocks. Craigs' US-based pick Amazon “has had an excellent year and has consistently outperformed analyst estimates,” Hamish Don said, with a total shareholder return of 51.5%. While it was commonly known for its online retail business, the technology giant’s data centre and artificial intelligence division, Amazon Web Services, was increasingly impressive. “AWS is an exceptional business with growing earnings and margins,” Don said. “The company should benefit from ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and management is becoming more convinced of the opportunities that AI presents.” Australia delivered for Forsyth Barr, with its Fisher & Paykel Healthcare competitor pick ResMed returning 50.6%. Although healthcare was inconsistent, with Johnson & Johnson coming in negative for the year for Hamilton Hindin Greene. The best-performing stock-picking firm for 2024 was Salt Funds Management, with an average total shareholder return of 36%. Salt knocked Forsyth Barr from its previously highly ranked spot - it made the smallest return for the year with a, still positive, 13.7%.

At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy.

Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs. This evolution underscores a future where AI goes beyond text-based applications, becoming a cornerstone for innovation across various industries.

The firm also named the company its “Top Pick.” Concerns include slower demand for previous-generation Hopper products and staggered availability of Blackwell versions. The firm sees this as a natural phase-out rather than a revenue decline, given a substantial backlog expected to sustain sales for several quarters Despite these challenges, the firm expects strong demand for Blackwell to persist and continues to rate Nvidia shares as Overweight, adjusting the price target slightly to $166 from $168.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks. AI stocks are stealing the spotlight today as the appetite for these services continues to gain traction globally. This surge in interest has temporarily diverted investor attention from dividend-paying equities. This year, dividend stocks have once again lagged behind the market, a trend highlighted by Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, during a recent interview with the firm. Here are some commeants from the analyst: “I just want to mention two interesting observations. One, interest rates have come down this year, yet dividend-paying stocks have underperformed. There’s this conventional wisdom that we’ve talked about in the past that falling rates are good for dividend payers and rising rates are bad for dividend payers, yet dividend stocks have underperformed in a falling rate environment. Second, outside of the US, dividend stocks are a little bit ahead of the broad market. We can table those, but I just thought they’re interesting to note.” That said, analysts predict this trend won't persist, as dividend stocks are expected to regain their strength and prominence soon. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon suggested that a dividend revival might be on the horizon. His team anticipates a 10% increase in overall dividends from the companies in the broader market in 2025, driven by investors' growing preference for cash. Highlighting this trend, major tech firms began paying dividends for the first time this year. According to Janus Henderson, these tech giants accounted for roughly 25% of the total underlying dividend growth in the US during the third quarter. Also read: 10 Best European Dividend Stocks To Buy When it comes to dividend stocks, analysts consistently recommend prioritizing dividend growth over chasing high yields. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar's Index team, emphasized this approach, pointing out that dividend growth is a completely different ball game compared to high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth signals a company's strong competitive position and improving prospects. A dividend-growth portfolio typically mirrors the market more closely in terms of sector exposure and growth-versus-value traits, including metrics like price-to-earnings ratios. While it maintains a value bias, it leans more toward the core market than a high-dividend portfolio. Over the years, companies with a track record of steadily increasing their dividends have generally outperformed non-dividend-paying firms while experiencing lower volatility. Although dividends are not set in stone and can vary, as seen in the current climate, they have significantly contributed to overall equity returns over time. Between 1930 and 2023, dividends and their reinvestment made up 40% of the annualized total returns in the broader market, with the rest driven by capital gains. Maintaining steady dividend growth is a demanding goal, as it necessitates exceptional financial stability. For businesses still in their growth phase with relatively lower stock prices, assessing the sustainability of their dividends becomes an essential and simple factor to analyze. This article explores some of the top dividend stocks currently priced under $50. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a Finviz stock screener to find dividend stocks trading below $50 as of the close of December 20. From the initial list, we narrowed down the selection to companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and possess strong dividend policies, ensuring consistent future dividends. From the resultant list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Overall VZ ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy under $5.

Listed below are the key takeaways for the month of December 2024: December 2024 will be remembered as the month Bitcoin breached the psychological $100,000 barrier, reaching a peak of $106,496 on December 16. This milestone solidified Bitcoin’s standing as a cornerstone financial asset, driven by institutional demand, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory support. IBIT 6-Month Fund Flows Chart | Source: ETF.com Bitcoin’s bullish breakout | Source: TradingView Number of Active Addresses | Source: Glassnode Investor sentiment turned bullish in December, with a marked shift toward “greed” as Bitcoin climbed past $100,000. However, caution emerged as: Gold vs Bitcoin Bitcoin’s milestone of surpassing $100,000 underscores its evolution from a speculative asset to a recognized financial instrument. While the rally reflects growing adoption and institutional interest, its sustainability hinges on a balance between regulatory developments, technological progress, and market dynamics. As 2025 approaches, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem is poised to grow further. Key global crypto regulatory updates The cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in December 2024 witnessed significant strides globally, marked by pro-crypto policies, pivotal legal precedents, and increased institutional adoption. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted the growing acceptance of digital assets as a mainstream financial category. As institutional players continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market, retail investors are grappling with a rapidly shifting landscape. AMBCrypto’s exclusive survey of 4,432 respondents provides deep insights into the dynamics between these two influential groups and their collective impact on the market in 2024. Institutional investors clearly emerged as the dominant force in 2024, with 57.5% of respondents identifying them as the biggest influencers in the crypto market. Retail investors lagged significantly at 13.6%, while 28.9% believed both groups contributed equally to shaping trends. Crypto market trust and institutional concerns The increasing involvement of institutions has fundamentally altered market perception. An overwhelming 64.8% of respondents stated that institutional presence significantly boosted trust, thanks to enhanced legitimacy and stability. In contrast, only 9.4% reported a decline in trust. However, the shift hasn’t come without concerns. 56.4% of respondents believe institutional dominance risks turning crypto into a clone of traditional finance, eroding its original ethos of decentralization. Liquidity gains vs. manipulation risks Respondents highlighted significant changes in market behavior due to institutional involvement: Retail investors’ resilience and market prediction The survey revealed a mixed outlook on retail investors’ future: When asked about leadership in 2025, 49.4% predicted institutional dominance, while just 12.8% foresaw retail investors regaining influence. Regulations vs. innovation Institutions are viewed as both enablers and potential barriers: AMBCrypto’s survey highlights the growing prominence of institutional players in the crypto market, reflecting their ability to bring trust and liquidity while raising questions about decentralization and fairness. As 2025 approaches, the balance between institutional and retail influence will be pivotal in defining the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s trajectory in December 2024 reflected its adaptability and innovation, bolstered by performance metrics, staking growth, and ecosystem developments. As a cornerstone of the crypto industry, Ethereum remained pivotal in driving decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs forward, even as it prepared for major upcoming upgrades.

Title: The Rise and Future Fall of MicroStrategy

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emil Sandstedt Follow -- 1 Listen Share TLDR: My interest in the story of MicroStrategy started out tangential at first — it was just one of many unconventional outcomes born out of the rising Bitcoin phenomenon. The publicly traded company, although first in the world to pursue a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, flew under the radar of most conventional investors, and it was only after the long Bitcoin winter of 2022 and early 2023 that both old and new narratives from the company and its de facto leader, Michael Saylor, broke through the thawing ice and began to spread among a bewildered audience. 2024 catapulted MicroStrategy to new sensational heights, and I soon realized I was witnessing financial history in the making. The general enthusiasm was unparalleled; sons went “all in” with the savings of their parents while old investors bought new houses from quick gains on leveraged positions. Any public display of hesitation to the many optimistic narratives energizing investment circles was met with scorn or silence. When logical arguments against the company’s ever higher valuation to net assets were put forward, they were answered by vague appeals to unofficial thought leaders or to a vision of a utopian future. On the verge of letting this one be altogether and mentally filing it as just another financial bubble soon to pop, I finally made the decision to work on this report as a veiled but growing Ponzi-scheme element of MicroStrategy’s business became ever clearer. So, having delved deep into the facts and fiction underlying common investor assumptions, it is now my firm belief that what is going on with MicroStrategy will end in disaster for most investors, should affairs not radically alter. It is a play of five parts, presented chronologically to the reader. Emil Sandstedt, 2024–12–06 MicroStrategy’s early history is laid to rest behind a thin curtain, mostly undisturbed by the hands of modern investors. It is known by a few that the company reached big and fell even bigger in the Dotcom Crash of the year 2000, but which growing Internet-focused company wasn’t experiencing great hardships at that time? Yet, could there be clues from those years which could be relevant today, to where the fate of MicroStrategy is heading? Let’s blow away the dust, break the crypt open and see what the passing of decades has caused to be all but forgotten. Starting out as a software company helping other companies make strategic decisions based on large amounts of accumulated data, MicroStrategy had enjoyed considerable interest and growth since it went public in 1998. CEO Michael Saylor had aimed at going public at $6 per share, had filed for $8–10 per share, sold the stock at $12 per share, only to see it rapidly continue all the way up to $46 per share. The appetite for intelligently utilizing digital data was, at this time, enormous. As an example, fast food restaurant clients could, by using MicroStrategy’s software analytics services, understand customer preferences within a geographical context; a customer in Florida was less likely to purchase a certain product than a customer in Chicago, given local circumstances. In a world where the customer is king, predicting what they actually wanted, when, and how, was profits in the making. So with Internet usage growing exponentially in 1999, Saylor thought it was time to ramp up his vison of the digital disruption of the economy. By analyzing and processing data in real-time, MicroStrategy now wanted to deliver a service which could feed useful information, not just to large companies, but to the public. The product, an anywhere personal information network called Strategy.com, was to be offered for a small monthly fee — today a very common model for software companies — and was therefore arguably ahead of its time. Starting modestly, the service was initially to focus on sending out useful information on fickle changes in financial markets to phones, pagers and other outlets. But the goal was more far-reaching than that — when the Washington Post asked Michael Saylor for more details on his vision, he simply noted that “I believe in fate, but all things being equal, I’d rather not be standing in front of a truck when it comes down the street.” With the sprawling information network and with the help of ear-pieces, civilians would be able to receive warnings of an ongoing robbery in the street ahead of them, drivers would receive proactive, intelligent heads-ups about traffic jams before finding themselves in one, and athletes would receive real-time data on weather approaching the game field. Michael Saylor, characteristically, painted a dramatic picture: “Take the police database in D.C. loaded into a network and then call me on the phone when there’s a robbery in my neighborhood going on right now. Don’t walk the dog, right now. There are police with sirens and shotguns running around in your neighborhood looking for three guys with knives. Right now.” The service, in other words, would help make life both easier and safer, with the help of a never-ending tsunami of intelligently processed data. Saylor, having observed the success Amazon had built by utilizing the personalized data of customers, noted casually in an interview, “So we started to ask the question ‘How do we get embedded into everyone’s life?’”. As the theory of the new business was reaching completion, Saylor now sought a $100 million investment, about the size of the company’s annual revenues, to bring it to market. Though a somewhat vague term, the company in other words wanted to bet on “proactive intelligence”. Adding to the examples above, Michael Saylor in another interview brought up the subject of fraud, and how an intelligent software could help mitigate it. In his example, a client is notified about the strange movement of funds from one account to another, followed by an automated text whether or not the client wants to cancel the transaction. It is not hard to see the advantages of such proactive warnings, and they are in fact implemented in multiple forms in today’s digitized economy. But in a way which would later become distinctive of Michael Saylor, he couldn’t help adding that his company was “to take everything from being unintelligent to intelligence…”, and that MicroStrategy was not an ”Internet company”, but an “intelligence company”. That also included disrupting the massive medical insurance industry with the anonymous processing of customer data. The idea that almost all data could be gathered and properly processed for all sorts of clients was a driving force in the appreciation of the value of MicroStrategy shares. Strategy.com was such a bold attempt in these early times of the internet, so all-encompassing, that it was hard to comprehend the potential ramifications stemming from a success of it. If the company could enhance data from hospitals, police stations, stock markets etc. in real-time, there seemed to be no limit to how valuable the output of the algorithms could be. Michael Saylor himself confidently stated that his system ultimately was going to “purge ignorance from the planet”. On a question whether or not going public with his company had changed him, Michael Saylor answered: “I think it’s made me better. It’s forced me to deal with more constituencies. It teaches you some things. Like integrity, for instance. In a public-company world, your word really means something. When you’re private you say, I’m going to do this, and if it doesn’t happen it doesn’t matter. In the public world, you say you’re going to do it, you have to do it. In the public world there’s a difference between 11:59 and 12:01, the last day of March. There’s a tangible difference. One of them is you go to jail if the thing gets signed at 12:01. One of them is the stock is up $500 million and the other one is you’ve just torched the life and livelihood of a thousand families. One minute.” Finishing up the Washington Post interview, he predicted his company would eventually reach $10–20 billion in annual revenue. And at the time, perhaps the prediction did not sound altogether unreasonable. Saylor had after all confidently stated that “I think my software is going to become so ubiquitous, so essential, that if it stops working, there will be riots. […]. I mean that literally. I mean that people will die this year because they didn’t buy my software.” Shares continued to climb in 1999, and in the beginning of the ominous year 2000 the company had become one of the most admired in the Washington region. Shares rose ever higher, and Michael Saylor threw grand parties at his Florida mansion. A plan to build a massive 50-acre Versailles was drafted. But the celebrations and toasts to new times were not to last long. In March, MicroStrategy felt compelled to adapt to new accounting standards put in place a few years earlier to better reflect the reality of the operations of a growing number of software companies in the nation. In practice, this meant that MicroStrategy had overstated its revenues two years in a row, and what was priorly booked as profitable years now turned deeply red. The original 1999 annual profit of $12.6 million was now restated as a loss of as much as $40 million. In a market sensitive to even small misses on investor expectations, the company shares crashed about 62% in a day, reducing Michael Saylor’s net worth by multiple billions of dollars — one of the largest daily personal losses in the world to that date. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the company’s auditors, had put a stamp of approval on past reporting, so the change did not exactly stem from a complete failure in that regard. What had happened with the revenue discrepancy was extremely ironic; a late-night business deal had been struck with the large technology company NCR Corp on September 30th, 1999, but as no flow of goods or money occurred that day, NCR booked it in the fourth quarter of the year, while MicroStrategy booked it in the third quarter. In other words, Michael Saylor had found himself in exactly the situation he so much dreaded during the interviews with the Washington Post earlier in the summer. Had he not booked the revenues stemming from the business deal in the third quarter, the company shares would likely have crashed and severely complicated the funding of the company’s ongoing Strategy.com transformation. Instead, Saylor and the other higher-ups in the company saw shares increase 72% in value since that fateful meeting, paving the way for large sales of their personal holdings for a total of $82 million during the period. That was more than four times the value of previous insider sales since going public. Not only was the revenue booked wrongly, but the deal also included the promise by MicroStrategy to purchase a business unit and some software from NCR, thus netting the total effect of the deal on revenues. “Revenue washing” is a well-established way to artificially inflate booked revenues while not being properly reflected in actual business activity. So, three problems were now glaringly obvious to investors who had just lost a lot of money: revenues had likely been booked in the wrong quarter, the $27.5 million NCR deal involved a tit-for-tat purchase of about $25 million, and the MicroStrategy executives and board members had sold shares that they likely knew were severely overvalued, to the open market. While the details of the NCR deal came to light, a later deal with Primark Corp. to distribute financial information to investors, also attracted the eyes of market analysts. Quite incredibly, Michael Saylor seems to have found himself in the situation yet again, where a business deal was signed and booked in the fourth quarter of 1999, while it was actually carried out and paid for in the first quarter the year after. Investors, oblivious at the time to any wrongdoings in the two separate business deals, had bid up shares above $300 before all the accounting issues came to light. All this seems to have become too much for the SEC, which promptly launched an investigation into the company. It eventually compelled MicroStrategy to admit to booking revenues wrong over the last three years rather than the last two. At this time, shares were down more than 80% since their all-time high. Michael Saylor’s company stake had dropped in value, from $13.6 billion to $1.7 billion. The Strategy.com investment never materialized as the company failed to get approval for new share issuance and sales before the value of the shares cratered in March 2000. A plan to raise up to $2 billion, then the largest stock offering in software industry history, came to nothing. Michael Saylor’s vision of a large proactive intelligence network was put on ice, and the company returned to its tried ways of conventional data mining. The abrupt fall was distinct enough to prompt James Cramer, columnist for TheStreet.com, to state that “This one popped the bubble. MicroStrategy forever changed the Internet mania.” The rise and fall of MicroStrategy would, except for the whispers in obscure investor circles, eventually be followed by a long silence. But the years passed, and Bitcoin finally entered the world and caused an ever-larger stir around the globe. Saylor initially discarded the phenomenon, writing that “#Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” But as the network grew, and after various decadent money printing schemes had been put in motion by governments in 2020, something seems to have changed within Michael Saylor. A growing opportunity now lay before him and his company, perhaps larger than all his prior visions put together, as a new untrodden path opened under the gaze of an orange sun. MicroStrategy entered its Bitcoin Exploration phase simply as an enterprise analytics software and services company with a checkered past and with fading growth. There is nothing wrong with that — the company made small profits on the capital it applied to the purpose. Few assumed much future growth in revenues, and valued the company shares accordingly. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2020 were reported as $110.6 million, a 6.1% decrease from the year before. In that same report (10-Q, 2020–06–30), however, the word “Bitcoin” appeared for the first time. What followed was the company with its investors, under the surprised gaze of its peers, boldly moving away from competing with IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce, to standing alone at the door to the growing Bitcoin sector. The report, after announcing the buyback of $250M worth of shares through a modified Dutch Auction, added that: MicroStrategy will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as bitcoin, or other asset types. (10-Q, 2020–06–30, Exhibit 99.1.) In August 2020, an 8-K document (8-K, 2020–08–11) was filed at the SEC, announcing the purchase of 21,454 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million. The risk factors section of the previously published quarterly report was amended, and Saylor noted in the document that: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it. We expect its value to accrete with advances in technology, expanding adoption, and the network effect that has fueled the rise of so many category killers in the modern era.” (8-K, 2020–08–11, Exhibit 99.1.) The conventional Treasury Reserve Policy of the company was updated with a Bitcoin-focus in September the same year, with a new 8-K filing. And after the Q2 report had mentioned the word “Bitcoin” once, the Q3 report mentioned it 154 times. The air in the company was now thick with change. During the third quarter of 2020, MicroStrategy ended up owning about 38,250 Bitcoin, purchased for $425 million ($11,111 per Bitcoin). This from a considerable portion of the company cash position. By September 30, 2020, MicroStrategy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $52.7 million, compared to $565.6 million by the end of 2019. On the 4th of December 2020, MicroStrategy bought 2,574 more Bitcoin (8-K, 2020–12–04). For the annual report of that year, the shift in strategy is again palpable, and the mention of raising capital for the purpose of buying Bitcoin through debt or share issuance could be spotted for the first time: MicroStrategy® pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. […]. [A]nd we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, p.5.) Approximately 70,469 Bitcoin were purchased in total in the year 2020, indicating many were purchased at the very end of the year. All Bitcoin now had an average purchase price of approximately $15,964 per coin. The later batches of purchases were made with an issuance of $650 million principal amount of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2025. The issuance was announced in December 2020, and had a conversion price of about $397.99 ($39.799 for the post-split shares of August 2024) and thus MicroStrategy went from purchasing the new volatile asset with surplus cash, to purchasing it with convertible debt. One of the first things incredulous onlookers reacted to was the low interest rate for the bonds — something which we will return to later. In early 2021, MicroStrategy, already operating under its amended Treasury Reserve Policy, officially adopted a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, further strengthening that focus. Within weeks, a new convertible bond issue was announced (8-K, 2021–02–16), this time of up to $1,050 million of 0% convertible senior notes due 2027. Though larger than the first issue, its zero coupon meant the lender’s full focus was on the equity component of the convertible bond. The focus of the borrower was, as we know, to purchase more Bitcoin with the proceeds. Conversion price of the bonds was priced at about $1,432, meaning about $143 in 2024 post-split shares. After the purchase of more Bitcoin, the number of Bitcoin per share climbed above 0.001. For the first time, investors in the company had to contemplate the nuances of MicroStrategy having issued multiple types of convertible bonds, as the conversion into shares of one issue could affect the parameters allowing conversion for other issues. Some confusion arose out of this, which we will speak more of later. In June 2021, a third bond issue was announced, this time of $500 million worth of 6.125% senior secured notes due 2028. This being a conventional straight bond, it can be observed how the market viewed the risk of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, through the coupon payments. Herein lies the first clue in how to view the low coupon payments of the first two issues. Were the earlier bonds really as cheap as they seemed at a first glance? It was a relevant question that investors could now ponder. At the time of this third bond issue MicroStrategy owned 92,079 Bitcoin, and now more could be acquired. As of January 31, 2022, MicroStrategy held approximately 125,051 Bitcoin (8-K, 2022–02–01) which were acquired at an average purchase price of about $30,200 per coin. On the 29th of March 2022, a fourth debt issue was announced, this time with Silvergate Bank, of $205 million secured by Bitcoin held in MicroStrategy’s collateral account. The loan had a floating rate equal to the SOFR 30 Day Average plus 3.70%, with a floor of 3.75%. The collateral was set at double the loaned amount, $410 million. Saylor concluded that “the SEN Leverage loan gives us an opportunity to further our position as the leading public company investor in bitcoin.” The Silvergate loan was paid back in March 2023 at a discount (8-K, 2023–03–24), due to the interest rate climbing up towards 8%. The payment could be made by the company issuing new MicroStrategy shares, though not yet at a premium to net assets. This meant that three bond issues, of which two were convertible, were still outstanding. In the 2022 annual report the company’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy had clearly overtaken any focus on the software business, as seen in the number of mentions of “Bitcoin”, and in the stated order of company objectives. As of February 15, 2023, MicroStrategy held approximately 132,500 Bitcoin with an average purchase price of approximately $30,137 per Bitcoin. Further purchases that year were funded mainly by the issuance and sale of new shares (8-K, 2023–06–28). As MicroStrategy at the time traded near its net asset valuation, meaning its cash and Bitcoin holdings, the share issuance and purchases were not much affecting the company capital structure. Not until the end of 2023 did the Bitcoin price recover enough to surpass MicroStrategy‘s cost basis. At that time, the company held 189,150 Bitcoin, with an average purchase price of $31,168 per coin. Starting in 2024, the market valuation of MicroStrategy in proportion to its Bitcoin holdings quickly increased to about two. This meant that the implied valuation of a Bitcoin held by the company was double that of a Bitcoin trading at exchanges. The software business, now a very small part of the company’s dealings, had become more or less irrelevant and could share no consideration in the total valuation. Investors were bidding on shares because of the Bitcoin exposure, and nothing else. Before the approval of the Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, a popular narrative circulated around the assumption that the premium earlier had manifested itself due to MicroStrategy offering the only possible exposure to Bitcoin for various institutional investors. MicroStrategy mentioned this dynamic in its annual report for 2023: On January 10, 2024, the SEC approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the shares of which can be sold in public offerings and are traded on U.S. national securities exchanges. The approved ETPs commenced trading directly to the public on January 11, 2024, with a trading volume of $4.6 billion on the first trading day. On January 11, 2024, and in the subsequent days following the SEC’s approval of the listing and trading of spot bitcoin ETPs, the trading price of our shares of class A common stock declined significantly relative to the value of our bitcoin. To the extent investors view our class A common stock as providing exposure to bitcoin, it is possible that the value of our class A common stock may also have included a premium over the value of our bitcoin due to the prior scarcity of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin, and that the value declined due to investors now having a greater range of options to gain exposure to bitcoin and investors choosing to gain such exposure through ETPs rather than our class A common stock. (10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, pp. 24–25.) As the premium to the company’s net asset value quickly recovered and continued to increase in the following months, despite the approval, some went in search of other explanations or narratives. The quickly increasing share price mostly dissuaded such considerations, however, and optimism reigned supreme. While some mulled over the rising premium to net asset value, the company issued more convertible debt for the first time in almost three years (8-K, 2024–03–11). $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2030 with a 0.625% interest rate meant more Bitcoin could be accumulated with the proceeds. Here, for the first time in a long time, could MicroStrategy make use of the premium to its net asset value. A few days later, another issue was made of $600 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2031 with a 0.875% interest rate (8-K, 2024–03–19). As of February 14, 2024, the company held about 190,000 Bitcoin, with a purchase price of $31,224 per coin. MicroStrategy had now officially morphed into the “world’s first Bitcoin development company”, according to its annual report for 2023 (10-K, 2023, p.7). What, exactly, this entailed is hard to determine, but a qualified guess is an internal focus was shifting towards building blockchain analytics tools, first layer Bitcoin clients, Lightning Network clients, and so on. Any Bitcoin software useful to the entity running it, could fetch a continuous yield as real as the yield from Microsoft software. As of April 26, MicroStrategy had accumulated 214,400 Bitcoin, meaning the milestone of owning more than 1% of all supply had finally been achieved. The coins were acquired for approximately $35,180 per coin. Total revenues, per the Q1 report (8-K, 2024–04–29), was $115.2 million, down 5% year-over-year, further emphasizing the fading relevance of the non-Bitcoin parts of the company. In June, a fifth convertible bond issue was conducted (8-K, 2024–06–17). The bonds were $800 million worth of unsecured convertible senior notes due 2032 with a 2.25% interest rate. Almost simultaneously, the company’s first convertible bond issue with a principal of $650M and a conversion price below the current share price, was prematurely redeemed by converting it all into equity (8-K, 2024–06–13). Capital structure decisions taken three and a half years ago now made themselves known. Though more Bitcoin were purchased with the proceeds from the fifth convertible bond issue, the Bitcoin per share ratio seems to have increased only marginally at this time. In July, MicroStrategy announced a 10-for-1 split (8-K, 2024–07–11). All debt contracts automatically changed in proportion, and the report has previously dealt with post-split conversion prices for the convenience of the reader. In September, the company announced Bitcoin purchases for over $1 billion, conducted with proceeds from share issuance (8-K, 2024–09–13). This meant it continued to take advantage of the premium to net asset value, and its accelerating accumulation now reached 244,800 Bitcoin. Also in September, a sixth convertible bond issue was planned, to raise enough funds to redeem the 6.125% 2028 Senior Secured Notes issued in June 2021 (8-K, 2024–09–16). The move is in line with a capital structure optimization strategy, as the new convertible bond issue would be done with shares at a premium. The issue was $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2028 with a $183.19 conversion price, and all the secured bonds of 6.125% were consequently redeemed — a good move by the MicroStrategy team. The company’s bond schedule now looked something like the following: The exploration phase was concluded; the company had now found its orange path to success, and it lay not in Bitcoin- or non-Bitcoin software development, but in pursuing accretive treasury operations. In a historical announcement in connection with the 2024 Q3 earnings report (10-K, 2024–10–31), the company, in a hat-tip to Satoshi, announced the goal of a $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering — meaning share issuance — as well as a target of raising $21 billion using fixed-income securities. The plan was to conclude over the course of the next three years. At the time of the launch of the plan the debt approximately amounted to a $4.26 billion principal. The rapid shift from being a Bitcoin Development Company to a Bitcoin Treasury Company is clearly seen in the change of the Business Overview section of the Q2 report and the Q3 report. The latter, having pushed all software development, on Bitcoin or otherwise, to the background, now stated: MicroStrategy® is the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company. We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry-leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of Intelligence Everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications, integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, strategic Bitcoin reserve, and focus on technological innovation positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. (10-K, 2024–10–31, p.26.) What a Bitcoin Treasury Company meant in practice was simultaneously explained by the new MicroStrategy CEO Phong Le, in an 8K-filing: “As a Bitcoin Treasury Company, we plan to use the additional capital to buy more bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset in a manner that will allow us to achieve higher BTC Yield.” (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) So with yet another rebranding of the business to a Bitcoin Treasury company, with a stated goal to create Bitcoin yield — a metric first spotted in September (8-K, 2024–09–16) — MicroStrategy entered The Golden Age in its pursuit of a place in the history books. Now fully focused on extracting Bitcoin yield to the fullest extent, the company defined the yield as, BTC Yield is a key performance indicator (“KPI”) that represents the % change period-to-period of the ratio between the Company’s bitcoin holdings and its Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of the Company’s actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. (8-K, 2024–10–30, Exhibit 99.1.) The Bitcoin yield could come from multiple sources, and MicroStrategy has to this date utilized some of them more than others. By selling shares through ATM offerings at a premium to net asset value, the Bitcoin yield could come out of the proceeds from buyers of the newly issued shares. The total Bitcoin yield is in that situation precisely equal to the total premium paid by these marginal buyers. In other words, it is not inherent to the ATM offering itself, but is provided from outside the corporate structure. By raising funds through convertible bond issues, a positive Bitcoin yield could similarly come from Bitcoin purchases made with the proceeds from buyers of the bonds, while a negative yield could later materialize should the convertible bonds not convert in the future. By issuing straight bonds, a positive Bitcoin yield could also come from the immediate proceeds, but would very likely turn negative in the future when the debt had to be repaid. This last method has been employed only once by the company (twice if counting the short-lived Silvergate Bank issue). The first two methods are much more lucrative with shares trading at a premium to company net assets. If shares are at a premium, this constitutes an arbitrage opportunity for MicroStrategy when utilizing the ATM offerings. Though not strictly an arbitrage, convertible bonds issued while the company trades at a premium create opportunities as well. If the bond holders in the future convert the bonds at inflated conversion prices, they receive newly issued shares at a price often above the company’s net asset value, and the generated Bitcoin yield would then stand in proportion to this premium. All this considered, the company’s 21/21 Plan logically focused on the first two types of treasury operations; more shares and more convertible bonds were to be issued. Within two weeks of the bold 21/21 Plan MicroStrategy had bought approximately 27,200 Bitcoin for $2.03 billion, at an average price of approximately $74,463 per coin (8-K, 2024–11–12, Item 8.01). The purchase seems however to have been made by depleting the previously undertaken ATM offerings, and any new purchase was now to be made through the new plan. On the 18th of November, we could first see such a filing (8-K, 2024–11–18). The company had bought 51,780 new Bitcoin for $4.6 billion in cash, at an average price of about $88,627 per coin. This catapulted the company’s Bitcoin holdings to over 300,000 for the first time, marking yet another milestone. Over 13 million new shares were issued to fund this. Two days later, on the 20th of November, the company’s largest convertible bond issue to date was announced (8-K, 2024–11–20). $3 billion was raised at 0%, with a conversion price of $672.40 at 55% premium, and with maturity in 2029. This meant that both the ATM offering arm and the convertible debt arm of the 21/21 Plan were being utilized. Issuance now occurred at a pace hard to keep up with, as the MicroStrategy team wanted to take advantage of the company’s shares trading at a premium to net assets. On the 2nd of December the company’s Bitcoin holdings reached above 400,000 for the first time as more shares had been issued and sold (8-K, 2024–12–02). Bitcoin yield for 2024 was now enormous, and about half of the ATM offering arm of the 21/21 Plan had been exhausted. With Bitcoin yield surpassing even the highest company estimates of the Q3-report, everything was going better than planned. The new shares hitting the bid on enthusiastic buyers in record numbers did nothing to dent the premium to net assets — in fact, November saw net asset multiples at the highest levels in years. With shares trading at 200% above net asset value, this meant the MicroStrategy treasury team could issue and sell shares representing ownership of 1 Bitcoin, to fund the purchase of 3 new Bitcoin. Net proceeds, 2 Bitcoin, would then be the Bitcoin yield, divided and given to all shareholders in proportion to ownership of the company. The 2 Bitcoin would be the Bitcoin per share increase in aggregate. There are a number of reasons the company could extract Bitcoin yield at the pace it now was doing. Investors argued that MicroStrategy’s debt was cheap. And indeed, it borrowed billions of dollars and paid often less than 1% in annual coupons — far below official inflation numbers. In a world swimming in surplus cash, it seemed lenders were willing to part with capital at record low interest rates. While this debt mostly came in the form of convertible bonds, it was argued that the company would not suffer dilution, because the debt was accretive with shares trading at a premium to net asset value. In fact, investors clamored for this type of dilution, seeing as the Bitcoin per share metric could continuously increase. The premium to net assets, it was also argued, came from the fact that MicroStrategy was a “levered play” on Bitcoin. With ETFs, investors either had to suffer the dull movements of an asset without leverage, or face the large risks and volatility decay of levered ETFs. With MicroStrategy, you could get a levered upside, but withstand being wiped out in prolonged downturns, as proven in 2022 and 2023. Because of the company’s flexibility to use “intelligent leverage”, the premium seemed reasonable to any thrill-seeking bitcoiner. It was argued that the premium also originated from “regulatory arbitrage”. With this, investors pointed to the fact that the company helped facilitate exposure to Bitcoin for institutional portfolios not allowed to own Bitcoin, or even an ETF, outright. The bond market, very large but also very restricted, had with MicroStrategy’s innovative convertible bonds finally a way to get exposure to Bitcoin on the upside, while being protected to the downside through the bond “floor” — the principal amount. It did not seem unreasonable to assume that if MicroStrategy now was the main actor providing such financial products, it of course should reap profits from the operations, manifesting itself in the share premium. At this time, the popular narrative of an “infinite money glitch” was used to rationalize a premium as well. And on the face of it, it seemed reasonable. MicroStrategy could issue convertible bonds with conversion price at a premium and buy Bitcoin with the proceeds. As the price of Bitcoin increased, the company’s fundamental value increased, meaning shares increased in value as well. With the higher valued shares, the company could now issue even more bonds, in a seemingly circular flywheel dynamic. Another version of this narrative is the notion that MicroStrategy conducts a “speculative attack” on the fiat currencies. So when the 21/21 Plan was initiated, and with the above considerations in mind, investors could foresee large Bitcoin yield payments to the shareholder owned company coffers. The shares increased in price accordingly. Within less than a month, Saylor could announce that the company had achieved a Bitcoin yield surpassing 40% year-to-date — an enormous number compared to the yield of traditional finance. Within five weeks since launch, the year-to-date Bitcoin yield had surpassed 60%. Everything crushed expectations, and it appeared to many as if the Bitcoin yield could soon be extracted in a near unlimited supply as a stagnant fiat economy realigned its rusting axis with a new, pristine Bitcoin foundation. While the ATM offering activities were absorbed by the market happily enough, the demand for the company’s convertible bond issues seemed near bottomless as well as they grew ever larger in size. Michael Saylor had become the uncontested hero of many bitcoiners. Having accumulated the single largest Bitcoin hoard the world had ever seen, nothing could stop the company’s ascendancy. Or could it? While foreshadowing clearly can be read between the lines of the earlier rationalizations of MicroStrategy’s valuation, it should be remembered that all this mainly took place in a market where equities reached all time highs, gold reached all time highs, and finally, Bitcoin and MicroStrategy reached all time highs. Whatever unstructured thoughts investors had in their heads all seemed vindicated by the reality of riches quickly made. No one had much appetite to consider what was happening through a lens of first principles, where complex financial dynamics are broken down in smaller and smaller parts that you know to be true. As the premium on MicroStrategy shares to net assets increased and not decreased with the accelerating ATM offerings, it was simply accepted by some as a truth within the asset, rather than as a contradiction in need of logical inquiry through laws of finance. Let us now go through many of the popular narratives and see what substance they all really hold. “Don’t forget the dirt cheap loan (.063%) he secured for 6 or 700M.” — Reddit user #1. “Imagine loaning someone 700M and 0% interest instead of buying btc.” — Reddit user #2. It is an easy mistake to make, in assuming that a low interest rate on a debt instrument means it is cheap. But because MicroStrategy’s many bond issues for the purpose of buying Bitcoin are convertible to equity at a predefined conversion price, a low interest rate on the bonds can’t be compared with interest rates on normal loans. It should go without saying that if lenders demand more than 4% from the US Government, they will not simultaneously demand less than 1% from MicroStrategy — a company with decreasing revenues and where the main business now consists of buying and holding Bitcoin. Convertible bonds are hybrid securities with debt-like and equity-like features. They are in practice regular bonds with free embedded call options, meaning the price (also known as the premium) of the call options makes up for the lender’s loss of a high yield, or coupons. Here is a simplified illustration of a convertible bond’s value at maturity: In other words, with the convertible bond issues, MicroStrategy had not found a philosopher’s stone, but could bypass a high interest rate on its debt only by giving away upside as the bonds convert into equity at conversion price. Just because investors wish the company could borrow cheaply, does not make it so. The company’s straight bond issue in June 2021 was priced at 6.125% coupon payments, giving a truer indication of the company’s cost of capital. To further emphasize the point, consider for a second what could happen if MicroStrategy were to move the maturity date further away, or lower the conversion price of the convertible bond issue, meaning the strike price of the embedded call option. A situation could then arise where a lender pays MicroStrategy for the privilege of lending to the risky company! The yield on the bonds turns negative. While seemingly unreasonable at first glance, it is simply a result of a large prepayment by MicroStrategy in the form of the free call options, for the privilege of “borrowing cheaply”. We can conclude that the narrative breaks down, yet it is repeated regularly by many MicroStrategy investors every time another convertible bond issue is undertaken. Some investors seem to have misunderstood another aspect of the company’s convertible bonds. It concerns the notion that the company is protected from dilution due to how the convertible bond issues are structured. And it is not a surprise that many are confused. Consider for example the wording from the very first company announcement of a new issue: “Subject to certain conditions, on or after December 20, 2023, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any […].” This sounds like a great deal to MicroStrategy — not so much for the lender. But this is common wording for convertible bonds. It does not mean that if the share price surpasses the higher conversion price stipulated for the convertible bond, MicroStrategy can somehow redeem the bonds just before they were to convert into equity (and as a consequence stop the dilution of existing shareholders). The wording is to force the bond holder to convert to equity, should that not happen for some reason. Certain bond investors may for example be market neutral hedge funds that short sell the shares while buying the convertible bonds. Many of them would rather the bonds not quickly convert — they seek volatility to profit from gamma trading. In practice, non-conversion is a situation which should never occur if conversion conditions have been fulfilled. Given a choice, bond holders of course want the higher valued shares at conversion price, rather than the initial principal amount plus a bit of interest. Looking at an SEC filing from MicroStrategy three and a half years after the first convertible bonds were issued, when early conversion of these notes to new shares actually took place, further strengthens this understanding: On June 13, 2024, the Company announced that it delivered a notice of full redemption (the “Notice”) to the trustee of the Company’s outstanding 0.750% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being redeemed is $650.0 million, which is equal to the current aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes outstanding and held by investors. The Notice calls for the redemption of all of the outstanding 2025 Notes (the “Redemption”) on July 15, 2024 (the “Redemption Date”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the Redemption Date, unless earlier converted. As a result of the delivery of the Notice, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 11, 2024, the 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holders of the 2025 Notes, at the applicable conversion rate of 2.5126 shares of the Company’s class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount (reflecting a conversion price of $397.99 per share). (8-K, 2024–06–13) In summary, if the share price increases, there will be conversion of these debt instruments into equity, meaning new shares. BitMEX research understood this to be the case as well while recently investigating the company’s capital structure. MicroStrategy is not protected from dilution — if it were, the lenders in the first convertible bond issue would not agree to a 0.75% coupon, but would likely demand something closer to a 6–10% coupon. As MicroStrategy issued more convertible debt, a question arose as to whether the potential dilution of equity by some convertible bonds affects the other convertible bonds or not. The answer lies in anti-dilutionary clauses. Consider that for convertible bonds the conversion ratio = principal amount/conversion price. Anti-dilutionary clauses means that the conversion ratio increases in proportion to dilution, meaning the conversion price decreases in proportion (as principal amount stays the same). A 5% dilution from one bond converting into equity, in other words, lowers the conversion price of the other bonds accordingly. Another way to view it is that the “strike prices” of all other issued call options, as baked into the convertible bonds, decrease in proportion to dilution. If there were no anti-dilutionary clauses, the company could simply issue shares and sell them to keep the share price from ever reaching the conversion price stipulated for the various issues. Lenders would for obvious reasons not accept such a convertible bond at low yield, because the free call option would be engineered to expire worthless. Again, they would demand perhaps a 6–10% coupon, not less than 1%, which has been the case for MicroStrategy. “Buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up, Stock is tied to Bitcoin, Stock goes up, Sell stock, use cash to buy more Bitcoin, repeat. Infinite money glitch.” — Reddit user Somewhat related to the narrative of “cheap debt”, is the popular claim that MicroStrategy has found an “infinite money glitch”. An investor may for example argue that MicroStrategy can issue shares or convertible debt, sell it, purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds, the price of Bitcoin increases, the MicroStrategy share price increases as a function of the underlying Bitcoin holdings, and the company issues and sells even more convertible debt. And round it goes. But MicroStrategy does not have control over the Bitcoin price; the size of the issues is dwarfed by Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Whatever buy pressure the company can apply on the Bitcoin price through these treasury operations, is multiple times offset by the sell pressure applied by the new issuance on the MicroStrategy share price. Note that the sell pressure is immediate if from share issuance or from convertible bond issues bought by market neutral hedge funds. The sell pressure is latent and may occur in the future if from convertible bond issues bought by regulatory restricted investors seeking Bitcoin exposure in roundabout ways. But there is ultimately no way around it all, unless the company were to pursue regular bond issuance, meaning the total risk undertaken by the company increases in proportion to the leverage. So any “infinite money glitch”, could just as well transform into permanent monetary losses should the company have to liquidate parts of its Bitcoin holdings or raise funds in a depressed market environment as the convertible bonds finally mature below conversion price. In other words, there is no glitch, but mainly debt-fueled risk taking which may give a certain boost to the upside, or a fatal blow to the downside. It remains to be seen how current treasury operations will affect the company when times are bad. The potential for creating shareholder value through capital structure shenanigans must obviously be discounted by the very real risk of future fire sales. “It is going up forever Laura”, though a catchy meme, is not economic reality. With the continued issuance of shares through ATM offerings to purchase more Bitcoin, onlookers thought that Saylor conducted some sort of magic trick, where he with no additional risk could increase the company’s Bitcoin per share ratio. It needs to be stressed that the issuance in 2023 and early 2024 was conducted with little to no premium to net asset value. In practice, this meant that any Bitcoin purchase through such a measure is fully offset by the dilution of the shares. The company may own 10% more Bitcoin after everything has been concluded, but any old shareholder has been diluted by about 10% as well. The Bitcoin per share ratio can’t increase this way — it is only possible with instruments such as regular bonds (meaning higher risk), convertible bonds (meaning higher risk), or with the issuance of new shares if the premium to net asset value is above one. Being generous to the prominent bitcoiners discussing the dynamics in the referenced video, they do in fact mention issuance during high price to earnings (P/E) ratios. The P/E ratio for MicroStrategy is currently irrelevant, however, and what they need to look at is, as has been pointed out, the premium to net asset value. MicroStrategy has no earnings to speak of, in relation to its high market valuation. Its P/E can in the future increase or decrease while booking unrealized gains or losses on the Bitcoin it owns, but that does not mean it is time to issue shares and buy more Bitcoin (or sell Bitcoin to buy back shares). The company should only consider such issuance if the premium has climbed some way above one. And such a scenario, in fact, happened a few months after the above discussion. It can be added here that the same dynamic holds true for convertible bond issuance. MicroStrategy can, if shares trade at a premium to net asset value, issue and sell the convertible bonds with a high conversion price, to the detriment of potential buyers of the bonds. As the shares trade at a premium, it is evident that the bond conversion price must be at an even higher premium, causing conversion conditions to be unusually hard to meet. As with the ATM offerings, MicroStrategy is better off issuing convertible debt when shares are at a premium. This share premium should not be assumed, however, but that will be discussed later in the report. More P/E-related confusion came years later, as MicroStrategy’s treasury operations brought heaps of Bitcoin yield to excited investors. In a clever twist of definitions, Saylor took this yield to be equivalent to earnings, and from there implied an extremely high fundamental value of the company based on a “P/E ratio” as well as “earnings growth” snapshot. There were multiple things wrong with this narrative. For P/E to be relevant in company valuation, the denominator must be somewhat consistent over time. A high one-off earnings number can make any company look undervalued versus peers, but it is all an illusion should that high earning not be followed by similar numbers. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin yield is provided mostly by retail investors buying company shares at a premium, and there is a finite supply of those. It is not honest to extrapolate temporarily high Bitcoin yield and imply the company should be valued much higher — that’s not how it works. Capturing the premium in ATM offerings is an activity with a finite lifespan, given the nature of the operation. Furthermore, part of the Bitcoin yield also stems from the convertible bond issues, and they come with a risk; the bonds may not always convert, meaning the principal amount would need to be paid back. Having then already categorized the Bitcoin yield stemming from such proceeds as earnings, is an Enron-like categorization error. The outstanding bonds in question must mature or redeem before booking the Bitcoin yield as earnings. Mark Meldrum pointed out exactly this. “#Bitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.” — Michael Saylor While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy kicked into high gear in 2024, it was argued that Bitcoin was the best reserve asset to hold there is for a company, because it has no drag, or no decay. The asset’s low maintenance costs were compared to those of the heavy machinery of Bristol-Myers Squibb, technical monstrosities that for obvious reasons are in need of constant service and care. The comparison fails because the machinery has an inherent yield — it produces more than what it consumes, or it would not have been painstakingly constructed — whereas the Bitcoin of MicroStrategy so far is a “dead asset”, sound asleep at the custodians without any conventional yield. While the comparison to physical capital is halting, it should be realized that even if one were to view them that way, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings still impose costs. Someone, somewhere, is paying the Bitcoin miners, or the network has no hashrate and subsequently is susceptible to DoS attacks. Assuming that it is others, and not MicroStrategy, that will bear the brunt of this cost is probably a mistake. It should also be added that MicroStrategy makes use of US custodians — the decay being the annual costs and risk of theft and confiscation there. Bitcoin is not a completely cost-less asset to own, and should not be characterized that way. A master wordsmith of analogies, Michael Saylor has provided his share of comparisons as well. One of the more famous ones is that Bitcoin is a “Cyber Manhattan”, digital real estate which people should want to buy and own for a hundred years. Having accumulated a considerable portion of this digital real estate within a company framework, investors were soon to realize the true value of MicroStrategy. This comparison halts on many accounts. While painting real estate in Cyber Manhattan as immortal, as not subject to a fickle or corrupt mayor, to physical decay, to taxes, to regulations, to break-ins etc., this is first of all forgetting that all such factors can change. Many nations are already considering taxes on unrealized gains, and to prop up their own failing currencies and bonds, such assets may obviously be excluded from the tax schemes. But the most obvious difference between Bitcoin and real estate is the yield received from rental properties. This is a sector which will never go away, because investors always seek yield. Even in a hypothetical hyperbitcoinized world, investors can invest in the real estate market and earn Bitcoin yield forever. Again, Bitcoin is mostly a dead asset, as is a gold coin, or a seashell. It does not yield in itself (and shouldn’t). For yield it must first be traded for a capital good, such as ownership in factories, skyscrapers, service firms etc. Another popular but vague Saylor analogy is that the company’s Bitcoin are digital capital, and that this is something novel and exclusive in the economy. Capital are production goods — goods of higher order. They are goods that are aquired for the purpose of producing consumption goods. Any software used by companies around the globe is digital capital. Any currencies used by banks to create financial products or services are digital capital. The term is not at all exclusive to Bitcoin, and ironically, most of the time when Bitcoin owners think they hold “digital capital”, they hold the coins in cold storage, just as a gold owner may keep gold coins in a vault. If the good is not used for producing another good, then it is simply not capital. There is nothing wrong with that — not everything you own must be geared towards production. “Don’t try to put some premium trading bullshit. Don’t try to make something up from thin air. Because all your models are fucking broken.” — MicroStrategy thought leader. Notwithstanding the fact that the belief in a persisting premium to net asset value, or NAV, is itself a model, we are now approaching the most critical takeaways of the report. As 2024 proceeded with MicroStrategy shares exploding upward, and as the premium to the company’s net assets persisted in spite of the go-ahead of new Bitcoin instruments, some onlookers voiced their confusion about all this. Simultaneously, the popular Quant Bros duo released their first video on pre-split MicroStrategy, titled “Can MicroStrategy (MSTR) hit $10,000?”, outlining something which “the Ben Graham philosophy would just never understand”. The high valuation forecasting was based on the assumption that shares could uphold the premium. Together with the Bitcoin yield narrative explored later on, it is the most important narrative within MicroStrategy investment circles today. They form the basis from which an immense wealth transfer from new buyers to old ones is occurring. Let us start by investigating this premium to net asset value narrative, and the many shapes and forms it currently comes in. With the growing amount of issued convertible debt for the purpose of accumulating more Bitcoin, investors found themselves warming to the notion that owning MicroStrategy shares instead of owning actual Bitcoin, was a “leveraged play” on the latter. Intuitively, it felt like the leverage was in strict proportion to the debt ratio. But Mark Meldrum rightly pointed out that this is misleading. If shareholders are levering by senior convertible debt, the leverage is rather to the downside than to the upside. If the share price increases, the debt is all converted into equity at conversion prices, diluting shareholders. If the share price decreases, the debt is not converted, but the shareholders must eventually pay the principal amount as well as coupons, if any. Meldrum is slightly too harsh in his conclusion that there is no leverage to the upside. It should be remembered that the conversion prices of the various bond issues in general are about 35–50% above the price of MicroStrategy shares at the time of bond issuance. Because of this, there is leverage to the upside in proportion to the debt ratio of the company, but only up to the conversion price, at which the debt of the bond issue is eventually converted, and old shareholders must share in further price appreciation with the new ones. The upside from conversion price and onward has been given to the bond holders in the form of the free call options mentioned earlier, to make up for the low yield on the convertible bond issues. There was of course a valid reason MicroStrategy paid nothing in interest rate for some of its convertible bonds. The loans were not free. So with a conservative debt ratio of about 25%, the leverage quickly loses much power should the share price surpass conversion prices in a parallel move with Bitcoin. A large premium to net asset value can therefore not be explained by the company’s convertible bond issuance. For investors seeking leverage on Bitcoin price movements, there is also an ever-increasing arsenal of instruments catering to that demand, such as levered Bitcoin ETFs as well as options with a Bitcoin ETF as underlying asset. None of these “levered bets” on Bitcoin carry the premium that MicroStrategy does. So paying more for a Bitcoin held by MicroStrategy, than for one you could hold yourself, must therefore not be excessively rationalized by pointing at “the leveraged play”. If anything, indirectly purchasing Bitcoin for a premium through MicroStrategy shares trading at high multiples to net asset value, means the investor is overpaying in proportion to the premium, for the doubtful privilege of getting leverage with equity features. And finally, it is important to realize that past performance of the shares is not evidence of a “leveraged play” — it is only evidence of buyers bidding up the price. If the shares indeed have increased in price much more than Bitcoin — the company’s main underlying asset — it is simply because many investors believe that is how the stock “ought to behave”. If shares were to decline for a period of time while the price of Bitcoin goes up, that does not mean the company is some type of short play on Bitcoin. It would simply mean investors are selling shares for some reason, and others are buying Bitcoin for another reason. Causality hides in the fundamentals of company operations, not in the price discovery of jittery speculators. Looking at the slope of a Bitcoin per (diluted) share metric could give an investor a better picture of how large any “leveraged play” in practice really is, but the surest path is to dive into how the company capital structure actually functions. Quant Bros, and others, also argued that the premium must persist due to the nature of the future awaiting a Bitcoin-laden MicroStrategy. Holding close to 2% of all existing Bitcoin by beginning of December 2024, it was now argued that the Bitcoin were to form the basis of the vague banking system of tomorrow, meaning any premium to net asset value must be due to various future banking activities with the Bitcoin as digital capital. There are multiple things wrong with this assumption. First, MicroStrategy is a software company which has issued debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin. It is extremely generous to simply assume that they have an edge in banking, of all things. What is to say that other custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken, Binance or the likes, can’t offer better financial Bitcoin banking products and services? Or that more conventional banks such as Blackrock or JP Morgan ultimately won’t start accepting Bitcoin deposits? Banking is a sector which has painstakingly developed over many centuries, and to think that outsized profits related to it can be made by simply having accumulated a Bitcoin hoard is very naïve. Who will borrow the Bitcoin? For what purpose? What if there are large credit losses, private key incidents, or wrong choices in future chain splits? No such considerations are given when the Quant Bros are discussing, not a 2X premium, not a 3X premium, but a 60X premium to net asset value. Looking at Nvidia, not in the business of lending Bitcoin, but of producing extremely competitive microchips and related software, the comparison was still thought a valid one by the enthusiastic duo. Curiously, Saylor also has a habit of comparing MicroStrategy to totally different companies: “For people that haven’t been paying attention or don’t really do any research, if you actually logged into our earnings call or if anybody studied the company, that’s like saying there’s a perception that Microsoft trades are a premium to its underlying assets. Oh yeah, it does trades 50 times greater than its net tangible assets. So does Apple, so does Standard Oil, so does every operating company, so that the myth, the misunderstanding here is people don’t understand what our operating business is.” (x.com spaces, “Bitcoin as a National and Corporate Asset w/ Senator Lummis & Saylor”, 2024–11–19.) What does it mean to MicroStrategy’s valuation, were it to actually become a proper Bitcoin bank? The average price-to-book ratio in the banking industry is slightly above one, as banks periodically mark-to-market assets and liabilities. Any multiple above one represents a premium stemming from expectations of future growth and excess earnings. Why a MicroStrategy morphing into an adventurous Bitcoin bank should fetch a high premium remained unexplained by the Quant Bros duo, which instead speculated that it didn’t “[…] think [MicroStrategy] being the most valuable company on the planet is widely unreasonable.” We have to remember that a premium for the company can’t be rationalized by pointing at general increases in the price of Bitcoin or in the past price action of the shares themselves — that is all irrelevant. A fund or an ETF trades at net asset value, regardless of whether the underlying asset goes up 100% or down 50%. So, a premium on MicroStrategy shares must come from investors expecting future growth, not in the price of Bitcoin, but rather in the Bitcoin per share metric. This expectation must also take into account the additional risk the company accepts in order to achieve this growth. Any conservative investor should not accept a valuation much higher than net assets, especially considering how the Bitcoin per share metric is engineered to increase, but more on that later. Many banks, while borrowing more cheaply than they lend out, trade at deep discounts to net assets due to the uncertainty of how solid the asset side of the balance sheet really is. As MicroStrategy ramps up convertible bond offerings, an outsized increase in a Bitcoin per share metric can very well be met with cracks spreading within its capital structure, should things take a turn for the worse in Bitcoin markets. Saylor’s comparisons to Apple, Microsoft, Standard Oil and other companies trading at a premium to book value, are misleading mainly for the reason that those companies are not banks. Their assets are not liquid financial assets like MicroStrategy’s, and they may also have depreciated book values over decades to lower taxable profits, or simply booked assets a long time ago so that they no longer happen to reflect profits actually generated. Current cash flows from Windows software products likely far exceed whatever once was booked on the asset side of Microsoft’s balance sheet. It should also be mentioned that most companies can’t very well issue shares and conduct arbitrage trades by simultaneously buying factories, office space, software or oil fields. MicroStrategy, however, can conduct arbitrage trades by issuing shares in order to buy Bitcoin, a liquid, fungible asset traded on hundreds of regulated exchanges, at all times of the day. The comparisons to fantastic price-to-book ratios in totally different industries are made to dazzle potential buyers of shares with back-of-the-napkin calculations on ridiculous net asset multiples. But none of it is real. Michael Saylor may speak of Bitcoin as digital energy, or of MicroStrategy as the crude oil refiner of futuristic finance — it is still wrong to assume that net asset valuations from that industry are at all relevant. There is no doubt that a lot of confident talk can be heard everywhere in MicroStrategy investor circles, with regards to the company’s premium to net assets. But talk is cheap as they say. Turning instead to the actions of the company and its leadership, greatly supported by investors, we will note that these actions fly in the face of the arguments the investors themselves simultaneously are making for any premium. MicroStrategy issues shares (equity), and convertible debt (equity if the share price goes up). This is, again, not a bad strategy while the shares trade at a premium to net assets. But it should be remembered that the company in this way slowly helps close the valuation gap that is the premium, by using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin or pay off old debt. With a premium to net asset value close to three, at time of the commencement of the 21/21 Plan, the company could sell one Bitcoin worth of shares, and purchase about three Bitcoin on the open market, or redeem three Bitcoin worth of debt. This is an arbitrage by definition — Saylor labeled the 200% risk-free return as exactly that while on CNBC in December. The glaringly obvious arbitrage explains why Saylor himself, as well as other company executives, have continuously sold shares throughout the year. It should be noted that Saylor’s selling plan was set in motion before Spring of 2024, when a considerable premium to net asset value had not yet materialized. Some investors argued that Saylor had to sell the shares, as previously received call options neared maturity date. But exercising the call options does not mean selling the shares is mandatory, unless there is some special clause we don’t know about. It just means the call options convert into shares at strike price. And even if it were the case that Saylor for one reason or another had to sell his newly received shares, the massive issuance and sale of company treasury shares would still have to be explained. Some optimistic MicroStrategy investors were then quick to note that though Saylor’s selling was not mandatory, it was done to buy more Bitcoin personally. But if they believed it was in his interest to do so — in fact that it was “a genius financial move” — why did they fail to consider why it is not in their own interest to do the same? If Saylor considers the shares overvalued in terms of Bitcoin, perhaps due to the arbitrage he himself has mentioned on national television, why do investors who idolize his every financial move argue the exact opposite? On the whole it may be concluded that the company and its executives do exactly what some defenders of the premium deem “NAV multiple trading bullshit”, and there is a logical reason for that. The constantly reoccurring SEC filings of executives selling company shares while never buying, do in fact hint of this truth which so few MicroStrategy investors dare think about. One wonders how many of these filings we must see before investors take note. Just after the announcement of the largest ATM offering in history, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang sold 5,700 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–06). One day after, board member Leslie Rechan sold 20,000 shares (Form 144, 2024–11–07). The same day Senior Executive Vice President & General Counsel Wei-Ming Shao sold 20,000 shares as well (Form 144, 2024–11–07). Not a week later, Leslie Rechan cashed out on 20,000 shares yet again, netting about $5.5 million (Form 144, 2024–11–12). On the 13th of November, board member Stephen Graham sold 30,000 shares, netting over $11 million (Form 144, 2024–11–13). That very same day, Wei-Ming Shao sold another 18,000 shares, and the day after he sold more. CEO Phong Le sold shares on the 14th as well (Form 4, 2024–11–15). A week later, Stephen Graham sold a massive 20,000 shares further, netting $9 million (Form 144, 2024–11–21). In the face of all this selling, investors still remained oblivious to the valuation conundrum the many narratives had obfuscated in their minds: Saylor, the other company executives, as well as the company treasury all appear to be massively selling the very shares that are supposed to be severely undervalued. Seeing as company executives and the company treasury keep selling shares in ever larger numbers, consider for a second a situation where the premium is slowly captured in this manner, so that shares end up with a valuation closing in on that of actual Bitcoin holdings. In other words, where the net asset value multiple is nearing one. Is it suddenly impossible for Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy to pursue the banking adventure, which supposedly is a foundation to the premium in the first place? Of course not. The company can just as easily pursue its wild career starting with 500,000, 600,000 or 700,000 Bitcoin. There are no incentives whatsoever for the company to leave arbitrage on the table for others to try to capture, since Bitcoin banking does not depend on any premium persisting. It is rather amazing to watch MicroStrategy thought leaders viciously defend the premium while the company and its higher-ups are franticly devouring it. There is another popular idea floating around in the MicroStrategy investing space, supporting the claim that the company should trade at a premium to net assets. It is the notion that “no one can catch MicroStrategy” in terms of the number of accumulated Bitcoin. The obvious question must then be, what this claim actually means, and why it should justify shares at a premium. If we are to assume that no other company will ever be able to own 2% of the total supply of all Bitcoin, that is all well and good, but what does that have to do with the premium? If owning such a large share of the supply somehow implies great profits in a future economy, it means the premium arises from being able to deploy the large Bitcoin stash for specific purposes. Why would not large Bitcoin custodians such as Coinbase, Kraken or Binance, perhaps sitting on even larger portions of Bitcoin, be able to apply their hoards in a similar fashion while sharing the profits with willing depositors? Would it be logical to say MicroStrategy “could never catch up”, because the company only sits on a few hundred thousand Bitcoin whereas some of these exchanges may have up to a million coins in custody? The notion is nonsense and has almost nothing to do with the fundamental value of MicroStrategy. Blinded by vast returns, many investors have stopped thinking when they assign a monopoly premium to the notion of simply owning more Bitcoin than others. Additionally, it should be noted that smaller Bitcoin banks (or “treasury companies”) can compete with larger ones. Though consolidation occurs naturally in a free market, there have been many thousands of banks competing for customers over the centuries, some specializing in order to survive. The same would occur within a growing Bitcoin bank sector. There are no natural monopolies. One prevalent argument in support of a sustained company premium to net assets concerns the so-called “regulatory arbitrage”. It is claimed that through innovative treasury operations, MicroStrategy can offer financial products to a regulated market which otherwise would have no opportunity to get exposure to Bitcoin. It should be remembered that MicroStrategy previously has discussed the premium in relation to the go-ahead of a Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. That day, shares fell sharply, only to quickly recover. Could it be that the premium to net asset value can be sustained due to the fact that, while many equity investors now have proper vehicles to get Bitcoin exposure, bond investors do not? The company’s convertible bonds have multiple times achieved large successes, so it has been logical to assume the regulatory arbitrage is real, and that MicroStrategy as sole issuer now could profit from it. But there are many things wrong with this assumption. First, we must ask ourselves why there are all these huge funds that are allowed to own only bonds. The prevention does not stem from nowhere, but from self-regulation in the case of family offices, and from laws in the case of pension funds etc. These rules were put in place by someone for the specific purpose of minimizing risk, while still generating returns to clients. As bond owners, these funds stand first in line to company assets should bankruptcy threaten. Now, Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, and while it may seem obvious to some why potential returns from it can look tempting to bond portfolio managers, it is likely not obvious to those enforcing the risk management rules. Any loophole suddenly allowing for large exposure to a non-yielding digital asset which very few have expertise on, can be closed just as quickly as it was innovatively created. For this reason alone should it not be assumed that a “regulatory arbitrage” premium is large and long-lived. How about other daredevils wanting Bitcoin exposure but can’t seem to find it due to regulations? Certain pension equity accounts may buy MicroStrategy shares, but not Bitcoin outright. Can a regulatory arbitrage premium persist through this type of investors? There is a case to be made here, but any premium would likely be very small, as agile investors could simply increase exposure to Bitcoin with their conventional savings, instead of paying a fee in proportion to the premium to net asset value when adding MicroStrategy to their pension accounts. It should not be assumed that people are not creative in finding the amount of Bitcoin exposure they are comfortable with, while minimizing more expensive, roundabout Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy. So, we are mainly left with a, perhaps temporary, demand for bonds with Bitcoin exposure, before regulators swing their hammers. And while observing MicroStrategy history up to the 21/21 Plan but also after, we indeed see such actors willingly buying the bonds, even when conversion price is reflecting a huge premium to net assets. Has MicroStrategy actually found an alchemic formula here so strong, to start attracting trillions of dollars from the untapped bond market? The answer is likely no. The buyers of the bonds are likely not the type of family offices where an ”orange-pilled” heir has convinced the managers that “Bitcoin bonds” is the exposure needed to increase pitiful past performance. No, what is likely happening with all the convertible bond issues is that MicroStrategy prices the bonds in a manner to attract market neutral hedge fonds, meaning arbitrageurs. Saylor has briefly mentioned these firms, as opposed to firms seeking actual Bitcoin exposure. For issue after issue, they can be spotted as the largest bond holders by anyone with a Bloomberg terminal. By buying the bonds, even when conversion price is at a large premium, and by simultaneously shorting the shares, these arbitrage funds can lock in close to risk-free profits. Due to the convex nature of the value of the convertible bonds, the hedge funds attempt to profit no matter whether MicroStrategy shares rise or decline: When shares go up in value, the (green) straight bond and embedded call option increase more in value than the (red) short position decreases in value. When shares go down in value, the short position increases more in value than the straight bond and embedded call option decrease in value. This is the lucrative gamma trading offered by MicroStrategy to the hedge funds to have the bond issues appear highly successful. Note that the “danger” of gamma trading — shrinking volatility — can be offset by pricing the bond issues at lower implied volatility than the market assigns the underlying asset, meaning shrinking the grey area of the graphs as they move away from each other. To conclude, whatever profits are made by these hedge funds are taken mainly from MicroStrategy shareholders; the profits do not materialize from thin air. The narrative of regulatory arbitrage continues to spread among retail investors, while little such demand is spotted in actual market activity. By talking about all these regulations, and by perhaps mispricing a bond issue or two to appease the hedge funds even more, Michael Saylor can regularly breathe life into the narrative that his company ought to trade at a premium to net assets because it alone can offer the financial products the regulated market demands. Mark Meldrum is even so cynical that he speculates that the hedge funds can attempt to engineer volatility outright, because it is the soil in which their gamma trades can grow and thrive. In other words, it may be in both the company’s and the hedge funds’ interest to see shares violently crash and recover, perhaps related to a leak to journalists, or to short report analysts. But all that is pure speculation. What we do know for sure is that though the narrative fails under scrutiny, it is still alive and well out there and helps absorb massive insider and company selling, resulting in enormous wealth transfers from new investors to old ones. The narratives surrounding the fact that MicroStrategy trades at a large premium to net assets are strong and in many cases convincing at a first glance. But here, they have all been investigated in detail and consequently dispelled. For large investors in MicroStrategy, it is of highest importance that the premium persists, because it is only from the golden goose that is the premium, that the egg, the “Bitcoin yield”, materialises. This metric, the increase in Bitcoin per share, is what continuously increases the fundamental value of the company, given any specific Bitcoin price. So let us now turn to the narratives surrounding the Bitcoin yield, and what they produce when working in tandem with those of the premium to net assets. “A Ponzi scheme is a type of financial fraud in which the ‘success’ of the entity is propped up by paying returns to initial investors from the money invested by subsequent investors.” (Investopedia.com) “Bitcoin yield” is the growth in Bitcoin per share — a metric mentioned many times in the report, and which has been excessively used to argue in support of shares trading at a premium to net assets. The logic provided is something to the tune of, while a Bitcoin is worth itself, a Bitcoin with a steady Bitcoin yield must be worth more. It is an honest metric for MicroStrategy in the sense that it takes into account conversion of convertible bond issues into equity. But it is dishonest in the sense that the yield is not stemming from conventional business operations such as lending out Bitcoin or developing Bitcoin related software applications. The company, likely for legal reasons, recognizes this to a degree in its SEC filings but still proceeds heavily with the metric. All that the “Bitcoin yield” ultimately is, is a transfer of wealth from new shareholders to old ones. Overvalued shares are sold, and understandably so, to fund new purchases of Bitcoin. These new Bitcoin increase the floor to where the share price must eventually go by the mechanic of arbitrage trades. The fundamental value of MicroStrategy, meaning the total valuation of the company’s Bitcoin holdings, increases in proportion to the proceeds from buyers of newly issued shares, because the shares trade at a premium. In other words, the new buyers are the Bitcoin yield. They are the arbitrage. There is no way of really knowing whether or not Saylor understands this himself — he might be lost in his own analogies. After the valuation of his company imploded in the year 2000, one of his friends noted that, “Mike let himself become this image that kept feeding on itself. After a while it’s drinking your own bathwater. After a while it became hubris.” Be that as it may, it is not with a little amount of irony that one of the company’s official principles today is to “treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency.” The issuing of new overvalued shares to increase the Bitcoin per share metric helps securing a profit for old shareholders (as the fundamental value rises above what they paid for their shares). It also helps securing a loss for the new buyers (as the market value falls towards the rising fundamental value). It is a mechanical operation which at this very moment runs its course with $42B worth of muscle behind it, until there are no new buyers of shares at a premium. The circular reasoning binding the two most important narratives together, and which is feeding trusting souls to Saylor’s massive yield extractor, can be visualized like this: This has formed the core of the sentiment given rise to the extreme run-up to $500 per share while share issuance has been running hot. The higher the shares run, the higher Bitcoin yield can be demonstrated to new investors. As the new investors are buying with previous Bitcoin yield numbers in mind, the base from which the yield is extracted must by definition be ever larger for everything to work. Mark Meldrum came to the same conclusion and visualized it wittily in a YouTube video which may one day become a financial market classic. By rotating the company’s own 21/21 Plan slides, he built a pyramid from which MicroStrategy’s highly sought after Bitcoin yield were to be extracted in the years to come. As there is a limit of the number of new MicroStrategy investors, the ever-lower foundations of this pyramid must start crumbling soon. It is now evident that uninformed retail investors are providing the Ponzi yield through the company’s ATM offerings, but what about the convertible bond issues? Who are the victims in that case? If the buyers of the bonds were investors hindered by regulation to own Bitcoin outright, a yield could indeed stem from these investors as they acquired shares at conversion prices far above the net asset value of the company. But as we have seen, almost all bond holders are hedge funds that sell short the stock at the time they take a bond position. By borrowing the shares to sell them, we are sadly back at the incredulous retail buyer once more, acquiring shares at a large premium. The sobering conclusion is the following: the Ponzi yield is extracted from retail investors both through the ATM offerings and through the convertible bond issuance, by the fact that the latter so far is a façade, a Potemkin Village. All narratives have fallen. MicroStrategy’s new KPI is extracted within the framework of a corporation, and is, if not the exact definition of a Ponzi scheme, something very close to it. In other words, a greater fool’s dance seems to be playing out to the tune of a multitude of confused narratives. And as with all Ponzi-like financial structures, this one will eventually face reality as well. Having shown mainly with first principles thinking how the many MicroStrategy narratives are false or flawed, it is time to explore the result of a dawning realization in these matters. As company management continuously captures the premium to net asset value through more ATM offerings and convertible bond issuance, there is an incrementally growing portion of investors whose future Bitcoin yield will not cover the cost of entering the Ponzi scheme. Finding themselves in one of the bottom layers, they observe how new Bitcoin yield is shared among an ever-growing mass of investors, and while the metric declines, the hesitation of potential new investors increases. It is likely that investors then will attempt to front run the increasingly obvious conclusion of the Ponzi mechanics and sell their shares to recoup some of what they paid to enter. With a drastically declining Bitcoin yield, it could otherwise take many decades for a latecomer to recoup what he or she paid with a high multiple to net asset value. It is both quicker and much less risky to simply sell immediately into the bid, while a premium still exists. The declining premium and share price will have further consequences, as we soon shall see. Before thinking about what a premium collapse means to the company’s ability to handle its debt, let us consider whether or not a declining Bitcoin yield actually is the only factor which will send shares crashing towards net asset value. It has already been concluded that the convertible bond issues are vital to nurture a company premium to net assets through the regulatory arbitrage narrative. The company feeds retail investors the narrative so that they can be used for exit liquidity as well as for yield. But the problem is that the bond buyers are gamma traders — they need volatility to continuously profit, and they don’t care much whether or not the shares decline, go sideways, or rise in value, as long as they do it in a volatile manner. Mark Meldrum was to my knowledge the first to point this out; if MicroStrategy fails to provide this volatility — the convexity of the long position in the arbitrage trade — then the bond buyers quickly abandon ship. Taking their place are cross-asset arbitrage hedge funds shorting the shares while entering long positions in the underlying Bitcoin on a volatility neutral basis. Such operations could collapse the premium to net asset value even quicker than retail investors slowly coming to the realization that when Saylor says he loves Bitcoin, he really does mean it and has no plans to abandon the capture of the premium. What further makes the whole convertible bond capital structure strategy precarious is that the larger the debt issues, the more the gamma traders will tame the volatility of the shares as they add to short positions when shares go up, and exit short positions when shares go down — all to stay as delta neutral as possible. In other words, they inadvertently pave the way for their own future indifference to the company, to the company’s concern. While trading at a premium to the company’s net assets is highly advantageous given the treasury strategy pursued by MicroStrategy, it has to be remembered that MicroStrategy’s ability to buy Bitcoin mainly occurs in such good times as well, after Bitcoin has already gone up in price. In other words, the advantage is often offset to a degree. The June 2021 convertible debt issue was the last one in nearly three years, owing to the brutal downturn starting in the beginning of 2022. MicroStrategy, riskier to lenders as the valuation of its underlying assets falls while its debt obligations stay the same, could not take true advantage of a low price of the asset it so highly believed in. By not issuing convertible debt in 2022 or 2023, the company could only make smaller Bitcoin purchases from past issuance, from small proceeds of the software business, and from small issues of shares and of debt with Bitcoin as collateral. To further make the point, the three largest bond issues to date have all occurred when Bitcoin was near its all-time high at the time, in February 2021, in September 2024, and in November 2024. MicroStrategy is tied to the mast when a storm hits, and can walk around on deck only in calm waters. The decline in the cost basis of its Bitcoin holdings, when it happened, was always negligible. The endpoint of this dynamic first makes itself known in longer market downturns. Debt must always be paid back. As MicroStrategy’s convertible debt is raised mainly in good times, it should go without saying that the fact that the size of it persists while the value of the asset it bought can fall, means balance sheet distress is a real possibility. Paying back the debt in the future may lead to very high dilution, at or below net asset value, or to the raising of new debt at exorbitant interest rates due to debt overhang as lenders demand yield in proportion to the risk they take on. In 2021, when the company’s balance sheet was not in distress, lenders demanded over 6% on straight bonds. Should none of these alternatives prove feasible, selling company assets may be the only option left for MicroStrategy. Since its only assets are the hoarded Bitcoin, those are what’s going to hit the bid on the open market in a frantic fire sale, where MicroStrategy must sell at any price. This is one possible endpoint of shares losing their premium to net asset value; falling below previously reached bond issue conversion prices, one after another, paves the way for the fire sale of pristine assets to creditors. What previously proudly was proclaimed “permanent capital”, then morphs into anything but. The claim could perhaps have been made should MicroStrategy’s balance sheet have contained no debt, but that is not the case. In a twist of irony not unfamiliar to Michael Saylor, the forced selling of assets, while making a mockery of previous “permanent capital” statements, would also be conducted in the light of previous arrogance shown the short sellers now about to flock. Saylor has famously begged people to short his company, because “they will have to buy our shares when we need them to.” Potentially on its head, Saylor would have to sell his permanent capital “when creditors and short sellers need him to.” Once this has occurred, it will be very hard to start up Bitcoin yield generation again as retail investors hesitate to bid up shares to a premium. While a 25% debt ratio may be of no immediate danger, the euphoria emerging from a Bitcoin bull market, combined with dreams of imminent hyperbitcoinization, may very well see this ratio creep up at a time when it should rather decrease. An increasing debt ratio would come hand in hand with an even faster increasing cost basis for the company Bitcoin. Any prolonged market downturn would then be able to cause severe damage, and Saylor might yet come to regret ever uttering the phrase “volatility is vitality”. The picture emerging in mainly Washington Post articles from 1999 and 2000 is clear enough to draw some final conclusions when tying together the past with what we can observe in the present. Though journalists often have to put a flair on things, to put it lightly, Michael Saylor’s own way of talking and his own actions are hard to twist. The man back then showed definite signs of being a cult leader, and the word “cult” is mentioned many times in articles from those days, long before the obscure mentions of cyber hornets and encrypted energy, and the daily posts of AI generated images of himself. Whether or not the word applies today, I leave for the reader to judge. Saylor’s convoluted analogies could capture a room full of educated people back then, and they do it today as well. Coming in new shapes and forms, investor hype for “proactive intelligence” morphed into investor hype for “intelligent leverage”. The likelihood that the company eventually will face a second collapse is high enough to stay far away. -- -- 1 Bitcoin. Austrian Economics. Monetary History.

On track to build the most powerful supercomputer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk's xAI has raised $6 billion in its latest funding round, pushing its total capital raised to $12 billion at a valuation of $50 billion, reports TechCrunch. The round, which involved 97 investors, followed a doubling of xAI's valuation within six months and solidified the company's position as a growing competitor in the AI sector. Major investors in this funding round include Nvidia, AMD, Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, and Sequoia Capital, among others. Only previous investors who backed Musk's earlier ventures, such as the Twitter acquisition, could participate. The minimum investment per participant was $77,593, but the identities of most investors remain undisclosed. The company plans to raise additional funds next year to sustain its growth as it seeks to challenge larger rivals in the generative AI market. xAI has already built the Colossus supercomputer, which is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. In the coming months, it is expected to expand to 200,000 Nvidia GPUs, and eventually, Elon Musk hopes to build a supercomputer with one million GPUs. For reference, $6 billion is roughly enough to procure a supercomputer with servers containing 100,000 Nvidia GPUs at $30,000 per processor. Typically, GPUs account for around half of the cost of a supercomputer cluster. With more powerful supercomputers, xAI will be able to train more sophisticated large language models to gain an edge over OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Musk has positioned xAI to compete directly with industry leaders like OpenAI. He has accused OpenAI and its partner Microsoft of engaging in anti-competitive practices that hinder funding for alternative companies. Also, Musk claims that xAI benefits from data drawn from X. At the same time, X's recent privacy policy change allows xAI to train its models using user-generated content on the X platform. Beyond X, xAI leverages data from other Musk enterprises like Tesla and SpaceX to enhance its AI models. xAI has rapidly advanced its technology with its flagship AI model, Grok, which powers several tools on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium users and image generator Flux. Unlike politically correct OpenAI, Grok can answer provocative questions while maintaining some boundaries on sensitive topics. Grok currently supports customer service for SpaceX's Starlink internet service, and xAI is exploring potential collaborations with Tesla for R&D purposes. However, some Tesla shareholders have expressed concerns, accusing Musk of reallocating resources from Tesla to xAI and viewing the two companies as competitors. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. xAI generates approximately $100 million annually, significantly trailing competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI, which are targeting billions in revenue. They also received significantly more funding: Anthropic and OpenAI have secured billions in funding. The report claims that AI venture capital activity reached $31 billion in Q3 2024, and as xAI accelerates its development, it aims to carve out a larger share of this booming market.

Time Published: 2024-12-25T12:00:00Z

By exploring crypto trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the ... [+] transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The world of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, moving beyond the headlines of Bitcoin’s market dominance and Ethereum’s smart contracts. In 2025, this ecosystem will witness profound changes influenced by global economic trends, regulatory clarity and technological advancements. In this article, we’ll explore five key trends shaping the future of cryptocurrencies—some widely anticipated, others emerging quietly but promising transformative impacts. By understanding these trends, readers can prepare for the opportunities and challenges ahead in this dynamic landscape. Cryptocurrencies have made monumental strides in recent years, moving from niche interest to mainstream adoption. The year 2024 was pivotal, marked by the approval of multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), legitimizing digital assets as a mainstream financial tool. Bitcoin’s halving event further spurred a bullish market, propelling the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs. Simultaneously, institutional adoption surged as major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto space, while decentralized finance (DeFi) continued to disrupt traditional financial services. However, challenges remain, including navigating fragmented regulations and addressing environmental concerns tied to blockchain technologies. These developments set the stage for 2025, a year that promises even more innovation and integration. Environmental sustainability is a critical concern in the crypto industry, and regenerative finance (ReFi) aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. ReFi goes beyond sustainability to actively repair environmental damage, leveraging financial incentives to achieve these goals. Projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations are leading the charge. The implications of these innovations are vast. Not only could ReFi reshape public perception of blockchain technology, but it also paves the way for crypto’s integration with global environmental goals. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. As blockchain networks grow, the need for efficient dispute resolution mechanisms has become apparent. In 2025, on-chain governance systems and smart contract-based arbitration are gaining traction as viable solutions to disputes arising in decentralized ecosystems. These systems offer automated and transparent ways to address conflicts without relying on traditional legal frameworks. The benefits are clear: faster resolution times, reduced costs and enhanced trust among network participants. This trend holds particular importance for enterprises adopting blockchain technology, as robust governance structures will be essential to scaling their operations securely and confidently. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have become a focal point in the financial world, and 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Countries across both developed and emerging markets are actively rolling out CBDC projects to modernize payment systems and promote financial inclusion. According to a 2024 report from PYMNTS.com, 134 nations are currently exploring digital currency initiatives. For underbanked populations, CBDCs represent a secure, low-cost alternative to traditional banking. “CBDCs, designed as virtual tokens, hold the promise of providing a modern and efficient digital infrastructure for the most liquid and trusted financial asset in the world: central bank money, also known as cash,” says Carmelle Cadet, founder and CEO of EMTECH. “Digital cash not only enables anyone with trusted onboarding to access financial markets but also provides essential liquidity for the new digital rails, all while minimizing money laundering and protecting consumers.” By reducing reliance on physical cash and enhancing transaction efficiency, CBDCs have the potential to reshape economic policy and boost financial literacy. However, their integration into existing financial systems is likely to spark critical debates about privacy and centralization—especially in countries where governments maintain strict control over monetary systems. The rise of decentralized identity (DID) systems is reshaping how individuals manage and protect their digital identities. Built on blockchain technology, DID systems allow users to maintain control over their personal data while providing secure authentication for online services. Unlike traditional identity solutions, these systems eliminate the need for centralized authorities, reducing the risks of data breaches and identity theft. DID solutions are poised to transform industries such as healthcare and e-commerce, offering more secure and user-centric experiences. As concerns about privacy and data misuse grow, DID systems represent a critical step toward empowering individuals in the digital age. As I explain in Top Decentralized AI Projects Of 2025 Amid OpenAI Copyright Concerns, decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. Unlike traditional AI systems controlled by centralized entities, deAI enhances transparency, security and privacy by enabling individuals and organizations to access machine learning tools while retaining control over their data. This shift addresses growing concerns about data misuse and centralized monopolies. The integration of deAI with blockchain is unlocking transformative potential across industries like healthcare, finance and logistics. For example, anonymized patient data shared via deAI networks can improve diagnostics while safeguarding privacy, and financial institutions can use decentralized models to detect fraud collaboratively without exposing proprietary data. These advancements democratize AI access, empowering smaller players to compete in traditionally closed markets. As we move into 2025, deAI's role in decentralizing innovation will be pivotal, addressing ethical concerns around AI governance and fostering collaboration across sectors. By combining the strengths of blockchain and AI, deAI represents a major step toward equitable and secure technology solutions in an increasingly data-driven world. Cryptocurrencies are no longer confined to speculative trading. As the trends for 2025 demonstrate, they are becoming integral to global finance, technology and social equity. From ReFi’s environmental solutions to CBDCs’ potential for financial inclusion, the crypto ecosystem is tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges. At the same time, advances in governance and decentralized identity are ensuring these innovations remain secure and trustworthy. To thrive in this evolving space, staying informed and engaged is essential. By exploring these trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The crypto industry’s key challenges include navigating a fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape, addressing scalability and energy efficiency concerns and increasing public trust through education and transparent governance. Privacy debates surrounding CBDCs and regulatory clarity for DeFi projects will also be pivotal. Over regulations could slow innovation in the short term, particularly for decentralized platforms and privacy-focused projects. However, the establishment of clear, uniform rules and fair enforcement could enhance trust, attract institutional players, and promote sustainable growth in the long term. The most transformative trends include institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, the mainstream rollout of CBDCs to enhance financial inclusion and the rapid rise of green crypto projects aligning blockchain innovation with global sustainability goals. These developments will shape the future of both the industry and global financial systems.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses 17 Stocks And Blasts Zero Day Options. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) stands against the other stocks. In his second appearance on Squawk on the Street after the Fed's interest rate cut, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the Fed's decision and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release. The PCE data was a boon for investors as it signaled that inflation was dropping. Cramer started by pointing out that the PCE data release was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." He added that the release doesn't reverse the market fall since he thinks that the market fell after "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing, after speculation in what I regard as being these, really kind of, I'll put them in commercial aerospace, because of Musk." Cramer believes that the central bank officials " don't wanna see that. They don't point blank say it. I wish they had. But that's what's going on here, it's the air going out of that balloon." However, while he believes that the market might have fallen because of the balloon 'deflating', this has created an interesting opportunity. According to Cramer, the speculation in the market has been replaced by "some really interesting fundamental news. And I think that we are the most oversold that we've been in, you're up there in terms of the ten-year low, if you bought, and I've got some numbers that are saying if you bought today, three months later, you made money. In every single case, it's really rather extraordinary." While the threat of a US government shutdown over the holidays has been averted, Cramer also had some interesting takes on the conflict in Congress. He shared that "I studied shutdowns for my last book. And every shutdown was a buying opportunity. They're always as frightening as the way we've been covering this morning. Uh, and they always end up being a buying opportunity. Because they are considered to be so frightening." Cramer backed his claims by sharing data that took all night to calculate. He added "What I'm saying, I know this is against the grain of what I'm hearing, but you're supposed to buy today not sell it. All the data I have, all the data I have, I mean I've got data going back ten years. And. . . [THE] oscillator, the S&P oscillator that I follow. It's minus eight, uh, thank you to the S&P people." The negative oscillator reading means that buying stocks at the dip and then holding them for certain time periods has historically yielded returns. Cramer pointed out "You have a median gain three months later of 4.55, sixty days, 11.0. I mean, this is unassailable stuff. I couldn't believe it. I asked them to calculate it. Took them all night to calculate. But oh my! You buy today, you make money! I don't know what to say, the data is the data! The forecast is the forecast! The guidance is the guidance!" He continued and added that while watching the markets early morning on Friday, he wondered "Who are these numbskulls who're doing this. They are people who are sleep-deprived, they don't know what they're doing. And frankly, we now know we have become the crack house. We are the crack house!" Cramer didn't hold back when criticizing investors who are obsessed with zero-day options. These options expire after the trading day ends, and therefore, they are for those investors who seek to profit from the market's daily moves. According to Cramer, people who trade these options "are debilitated. They are, they believe the long term means you gotta hold it to the afternoon. Uh, these people I feel bad for them because they're losing fortunes, they don't know what they're doing." He believes that day trading is more "addictive" than online gambling. "Depression, anxiety, all the things that are tell-tale of how to wreck your life are now part of our market," believes Cramer. In fact, according to him, options trading needs to be talked about more. Cramer pointed out that "$538 million is options! Out of $1.9 billion. $538 million! Crypto is $268 million! Their next big line is margin interest! $220 mil! Why aren't people talking about this?" According to Cramer, "These people are losing a lot of money. And maybe they ought to take a little more long-term approach. We have to say, look, if you think that you can trade up against professionals, and the professionals have software, the professionals have algorithms, the professionals know more than the people who are day trading. That's what I'm saying." However, he does believe that "you can balance it. You can do some of this stuff for fun if you want to. But my father was wiped out by trading the National Video. Now go Google National Video. He did day trading for it all the way down." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired on Friday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a worker inspecting a galvanised sheet steel product in a well-lit warehouse. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 32 Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is an American steel company that sells manufactured products and iron-based raw materials. Steel has been one of the poorest-performing sectors in the American economy in 2024. Steel spot prices have struggled throughout 2024, leading to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)'s peers such as US Steel posting disappointing earnings. Amidst industry troubles, the firm has kept up with stock repurchases despite the fact that its shares have lost 33.6% year-to-date. These repurchases were also on Cramer's mind as he noted: "Well Nucor bought a ton of stock when it was much much higher. And in many of the greats are going down in this country. If you looked at Nucor which is obviously the gold standard. I mean this company has lost 34% of its value this year and that's an example Carl of why if you really think that the Fed made a mistake, you would say well listen I'm looking at that company which is incredibly important for construction. Or incredibly important for, uh, every single manufacturing plant in this country. And it shows you, look out, we're, we're showing real weakness there. So we've got an economy that's weak and an economy that's strong. It's hard to reconcile." Overall NUE ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NUE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NUE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street shares 4 predictions for AI going into 2025 — including 3 trades to maximize returns

It's looking like the AI hype will continue for a third consecutive year. The technology has polarized investors and market experts across Wall Street, with some believing it'll completely transform the economy and others believing it's creating a stock-market bubble ripe for popping. Regardless of what you think about AI, it's had an undeniable impact on the market. Hardware, Big Tech, anything data-center-related — investors who bet on these areas of the market this year reaped handsome rewards. But technology advances fast, and today's AI playbook may very well become outdated in the new year. Business Insider compiled views from four Wall Street firms to see what some of the most influential financial institutions think about the future of AI. Here's what Wall Street is predicting about the technology and how you can update your portfolio. If there's one thing that AI proponents and naysayers can agree on, it's that the technology is expensive to produce. Building data centers, stocking up on GPUs, powering AI — all of that doesn't come cheap. In 2024, Big Tech companies poured mind-boggling amounts of capital into building out AI infrastructure. By the end of the year, it's likely that Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft will have spent $222 billion on AI capital expenditures, which is a 50% increase from last year, according to UBS. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, according to some Wall Street firms. According to BlackRock's 2025 outlook, "major tech companies are starting to rival the U.S. government on research and development spending." "We estimate spending on this infrastructure could top $700 billion by 2030, equivalent to 2% of U.S. GDP," the asset manager added. Expect continued investment in data centers, chips, and power systems as AI models become more complex. That means investors who bought into the picks and shovels AI trade in 2024 should stay invested, UBS argues. Going into next year, the bank recommends looking into utilities, as the electricity providers fueling AI data centers are seeing a steady uptick in demand. Examples of utilities funds include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY). AI investing in 2024 was largely defined by what Goldman Sachs calls the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trades of AI infrastructure. Investors flocked to Nvidia, the superstar Phase 1 stock, as well as the Phase 2 AI picks and shovels, including data centers and other semiconductor companies. While those trades are clearly still hot, there'll be new opportunities to invest in AI as more use cases emerge, many on Wall Street believe. 2025 will see a widening field of investment opportunities, particularly in so-called Phase 3 companies that are monetizing AI and using it to boost their revenue streams, Goldman Sachs says. The bank has identified 11 stocks that are using AI to increase their revenues, per their last quarterly earnings calls. They include ACV Auctions, Commvault Systems, Cloudflare, Datadog, DigitalOcean, Dynatrace, Fortinet, Gartner, Hubspot, Mastercard, and ServiceNow. UBS also highlights a few areas of the market in particular for investors to keep an eye out for in the coming years. "We expect successful generative AI applications across a range of industries, including in health care, cybersecurity, and fintech," UBS said. US stocks have outperformed global markets in 2024 thanks in large part to AI. The large sums being spent on AI are paying off for US companies. According to Apollo, the US has more data centers than all other major countries combined, giving it a significant advantage in the industry. "The US is experiencing a surge in corporate and research spending on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution—a dynamic not seen in other developing nations or even China," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo, wrote in the firm's 2025 outlook. Robust AI investment may be part of the reason why the overall US economy has performed so well. "The federal government's investments in green energy and infrastructure, along with private sector investments in AI, have been crucial to the nation's economic resilience," Sløk added. The boom in construction from building AI infrastructure, as well as the ongoing energy transition to power data centers, is a powerful tailwind for the US economy and the AI trade going into 2025. For that reason, BlackRock is betting on US equities going into 2025. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," the asset manager wrote in its 2025 outlook. Some examples of US-based AI funds include the Xtrackers Artificial Intelligence and Big Data ETF (XAIX) and the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW). AI could have an overlooked benefit to the stocks in your portfolio: it could lower inflation. The technology has the potential to usher in a new era of labor and productivity gains for the economy, according to BlackRock and UBS. As more companies adopt AI tools, routine tasks will be automated and new business models will be implemented. That'll lead to decreasing inflation as the supply of goods and services increases, thanks to automation. This won't be an instantaneous change, but rather one that slowly emerges over the next few years, UBS said in its 2025 outlook. That's a promising side effect of AI, especially as the Federal Reserve has battled to bring inflation down in 2024 and some economists speculate that inflation could remain elevated in the long term. "If AI's potential can be realized, we believe it could augur a productivity revolution and contribute to lower prices for various goods and services and higher rates of economic growth," UBS said. "For investors, at a macroeconomic level, we believe the AI revolution is likely to help lower inflation, boost growth, and therefore result in higher real interest rates in the years ahead," the bank added.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/12/25/more-reasons-for-cautious-optimism-about-the-demise-of-the-green-energy-fantasy/
Time Published: 2024-12-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. Agree. SSAB have been collaborating with Mercedes for some time so I think steel for vehicle production will be their initial step. According to current data, around 70% of steel in the United States is manufactured using electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which are considered electric furnaces; this means a significant majority of American steel production relies on electric furnaces. Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore. I recall reading awhile back that a pilot process for smelting iron ore with hydrogen malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that killed a worker and injured several other workers. I doubt that Millivolt is insane, atticman. But he has a very low (and alas accurate) assessment of how well British education prepares the population for critical thinking. In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space. References: The ERA5 reanalysis model is a product of ECMWF, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Number of bad investments correlates well with number of government investments. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%. Just a thought about “ never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar” A true but misleading statement. “Electricity production” is not full-time electric service–as we are used to and require. “Electricity” from intermittent, sporadic machines does not/cannot provide full time, on-demand electric service. (for typical residential, commercial, industrial use). To contribute at all, solar and wind must connect to a grid of rotating generation from coal, natural gas, oil, large hydro, or nuclear. With specialized equipment at various grid locations calculated for reliability, stability and regulation. AC frequency, voltage, current, reactances, and other instant (frequency in HZ or AC cycles are usually 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. A transmission grid or distribution network requires controls that continuously monitor and take stabilizing actions as needed to provide AC within best engineering practices. Best engineering practices used to include lowest capital, construction, and operational costs. Sadly no longer used.

RAIN, HAIL, OR snow, every Christmas Day troves of people across the country take to bodies of water for a Christmas Day swim. Luckily, today you don’t need to worry about hail or snow if you are planning on participating. According to the Met Éireann forecast, today will be mild and quite cloudy, though some brighter breaks will develop. Speaking to The Journal, meteorologist Brandon Creagh said that it is unseasonably mild, and this morning will have temperatures of between 10 and 11 degrees across the whole country. “The sea is actually going to be pretty much fairly close to that as well,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures are forecast to be around 10 or 11 degrees. “But I would encourage people to keep an eye on the advice from water safety Ireland and the Irish coast guard, which has been circling around on Christmas Day.” Advertisement Creagh said that the unseasonable weather is the result of mild air that has been pushed up from the south due to a high pressure system centered around Europe. “So the whole country is going to experience fairly similar conditions tomorrow, some places might get a little bit more sun than others, but exactly where that will be remains to be seen,” he said. Most places will be dry but a few patches of light rain and drizzle will affect the western half of the country. Highest temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees in moderate southwest winds, fresh at times on west and northwest coasts.

Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo COPE Galway has issued a list of precautions for swimmers to be aware of as they take on the Christmas Day swim. The charity is organising the swim, which takes place this morning at Blackrock Pier in Salthill. Last year, over 850 people took place in the swim. COPE Galway said for swimmers to stay visible, not to swim alone, avoid diving and swimming after consuming alcohol or a large meal. It also said to avoid staying in the water for too long and to bring a warm drink and warm clothes to change into. Lifeguards will be present at the swim, but it warned that participants should be aware of the safety guidelines. Organised swims are taking place all across the country today. Despite the mild weather, it is still recommended to wrap up warm and not too spend too long in the water. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Elon Musk’s xAI raises $6B to bolster battle against OpenAI: ‘Gonna need a bigger compute!’
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/business/elon-musks-xai-raises-6b-to-bolster-battle-against-openai/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T19:16:04Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI revealed that it raised $6 billion in its latest funding round as the startup continues to ramp up in its battle against bitter rival OpenAI. Musk took a victory lap after announcing Monday on his social media platform X that the company concluded its Series C funding round — which is usually the final stage of venture capital financing. “We are gonna need a bigger compute!” Musk wrote, in an apparent reference to the famous line from “Jaws.” The need for a “bigger compute” is likely an indication that Musk plans to use the investment to build larger processing centers to warehouse super computers that will be needed to train and run more sophisticated AI models. The company had raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round in May at a post-money valuation of $24 billion. In late November, xAI raised another $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears xAI raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but Musk didn’t disclose the valuation. Investors in the latest funding round included Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holdings, the sovereign wealth funds of Oman and Qatar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital and UAE-based MGX, the company said. In its latest announcement, xAI said that it is training Grok 3, the latest version of its chatbot, which was originally scheduled to be available by the end of this year. The infusion of cash comes as Musk is engaged in an AI arms race against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the company he co-founded and which is now run by Sam Altman. Musk, who left OpenAI after losing a power struggle against Altman and other co-founders, is suing the company and its key financial backer Microsoft. He is alleging that Microsoft and OpenAI, which as of October was valued at around $157 billion, illegally sought to monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors.

Adirondack chairs on a wooden dock on a calm lake in Muskoka, Ontario Canada. Cottages nestled ... [+] between trees are visible across the water. Not many people know this, but if you really want to diversify—deftly balancing and rebalancing to maximize (and protect) your gains, you need to invest in closed-end funds (CEFs). Doing this with CEFs, which yield around 8% on average, gives you two key advantages: First, you get a much bigger income stream. That’s great on its own. But if you’re reinvesting your income, you get an even bigger edge because you can easily redirect your dividends from one CEF to another in a different sector. You just can’t do this with an index fund. Let’s dig into how that works in practice. While 2024 has been a great year for stocks, some sectors are lagging, as is always the case. And right now, as we look ahead to 2025, is a good time to reallocate a bit from your winners into the stragglers. That’s because, over time, these laggards will likely revert to their long-term average performance. A look at the sectors making up the S&P 500 tells us that the biggest winners this year have been the communication services, finance, consumer discretionary and tech sectors. These firms are picking up the slack we’ve seen in materials, energy and healthcare. I want to focus on healthcare, because the gap between this year’s performance (up just around 1.1% following last week’s selloff) and what the sector has done in the long run is striking. With about a 9% annualized return over the last decade, healthcare has performed relatively well, making it a good target for rebalancing by moving profits (or CEF dividends) into it from the stronger-performing sectors of 2024. The highest-yielding healthcare CEF is the abrdn Healthcare Investors Fund (HQH), a 14.2% payer whose portfolio includes key pharma names like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). It would take just $705,000 invested in this fund to get $100,000 per year in income. Plus, HQH’s focus on healthcare means we could pair it with other sector-specific CEFs and rebalance to ensure we aren’t overexposed to any particular industry—and also profit from the performance differences between those sectors. But to make certain HQH is the best CEF for this strategy, we need to dig deeper. As of this writing, HQH has beaten the healthcare sector as a whole, with a 7.9% total NAV return year to date (this is a CEF-specific measure that examines the performance of a fund’s underlying portfolio, rather than its price on the open market), about seven times the return of the benchmark Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV). However, on the open market, the fund has returned 10.6%, including dividends paid out. This gap largely stems from the fund’s big discount to NAV (or the difference between the NAV- and market price–based return), which was over 15% at the start of the year and has now returned to that overly generous discount following the big selloff last week. This is a new buying opportunity, and momentum could drive that discount smaller still over the coming months if the market’s recent panic subsides, pulling up the fund’s market price with it. And if HQH doesn’t cut its payout, we may indeed see that discount get smaller still. There are two problems, however: Obviously, the market pullback might not yet be done and, more importantly, HQH raised its dividend in May, which means it’s now paying a 12.6% yield on NAV, much higher than that 7.9% total NAV return we just talked about. This means the dividend might need to be cut. Or HQH will need to pay out shareholder capital, shrinking the fund’s size—and its gain potential. That’s a tough situation, made worse by management’s decision to raise the payout. Now let’s consider the BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BME), whose 7% yield is half that of HQH. BME trades at a less generous 10.3% discount, but the trend in this discount (in orange below) is very different than that of HQH (in purple). BME Discount HQH went from being priced at par to a huge discount to going back toward par over the last three years to plummeting last week. BME, meantime, has been on a steady descent toward a bigger discount (although the vector of decline has flattened out significantly in 2024, and it didn’t change all that much with the recent selloff). This would suggest BME is at risk of getting cheaper, but there’s a key detail: The fund is part of BlackRock’s “discount management program,” under which the company buys a certain amount of some CEFs (including BME) if their average discount is more than 7.5% during a three-month measurement period. HQH has no such initiative, which is why its discount grew so large late last year and why its discount could grow so massively. This means BME is unlikely to see its discount go much lower. And even if it does, BlackRock’s discount-management program means the firm will buy back shares on a quarterly basis at a 2% discount. If you tender your shares during this offer after buying at the fund’s current price, the result would be an instant 9.3% profit. There’s one more reason to prefer BME over HQH, despite its lower yield. BME Total Returns Over the last five years, BME (in orange above) has outperformed HQH on a total-NAV-return basis. This suggests it should be priced at a much smaller discount than HQH, on the strength of its stronger management. This also suggests BME is the better buy when its discount gets unusually wide. Thus, while HQH’s huge dividends make it look like the better choice, if you want to buy and hold a sector fund for the long term, BME is likely to outperform HQH, especially if BlackRock continues its discount-management program. However, if abrdn were to start its own discount-management program, HQH might have the edge. Until that happens, though, my money’s on BME.

From crypto CEOs who advocate for the industry to NFT project founders who use their good fortune to help others, several Web3 workhorses made their way onto Saint Nick's “nice list” this year. Here's who can expect presents under the tree when Santa comes to town. Brian Armstrong is the face of the digital assets industry's fight for more favorable regulations in the U.S. The soft-spoken CEO of Coinbase spent ample time in Washington this year, participating in discussions with Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on the future of crypto in the U.S. Meanwhile, Armstrong’s team led initiatives to center digital assets-related issues in the 2024 U.S. elections, sponsoring studies on crypto holders' political leanings and facilitating Republican candidate Donald Trump's push to accept campaign donations in crypto. Armstrong and his team were instrumental in building up pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake's $200 million war chest. Coinbase donated roughly $50 million each to Fairshake between 2023 and 2024, helping secure the election of the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress ever. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo is the face of the crypto industry’s tokenization craze—a trend that has helped catapult digital asset prices to new heights in 2024. In June, the executive delivered testimony on Capitol Hill about the importance of real-world asset tokenization and its implications for the future of finance. Domingo is also an important ally to institutional investors looking to pour funds into crypto. Earlier this year, the Spanish founder's tokenization platform partnered with BlackRock to launch the investment titan's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has continued to be a fierce advocate for Bitcoin, adding more than $15 billion worth of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to his company’s balance sheet in the last few weeks, according to the company’s filing with U.S. regulators. Saylor’s firm holds 423,650 Bitcoin (worth $41.5 billion) as of publication time, the company’s financial statements show. Despite HODLing roughly 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be mined, Saylor has contributed to the future of the cryptocurrency in another big way—by encouraging other tech giants to hold the asset. Earlier this month, Saylor pitched Microsoft’s directors on a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet—a proposal its shareholders ultimately rejected. In addition, he urged Amazon shareholders to also nudge the delivery company toward investing in the digital currency. Many other smaller companies have also followed MicroStrategy’s playbook. Maggie Love is the founder of SheFi, a community for women in the cryptocurrency industry. SheFi offers dedicated job boards, courses and networking opportunities for women, a demographic group that remains largely underrepresented in Web3 and the broader technology sector. Less than 15% of startups within the Web3 ecosystem have at least one female founder, while just 3% have an all-female founding team, according to a Boston Consulting Group analysis of Crunchbase data. A year ago, SheFi Summit was an experiment. Today it's a movement. Grateful to all 500+ of you who came out to the biggest SheFi Summit yet and made it incredibly clear: The frontier is feminine. pic.twitter.com/PnuUZgv2Az — maggie love wu (@maggielove_) July 7, 2024 SheFi is challenging that lack of representation, however. Since its inception, SheFi has amassed more than 3,000 members, making it one of the largest women-led communities in crypto. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has continued to advocate for privacy rights at a time when cryptocurrency and blockchain network adoption is accelerating. The vector of development that the internet and society is traveling leads away from extraordinary people sharing unique beliefs, and toward a tyranny of mediocrity. It is a preference for "normal" so strong that it extinguishes excellence; a ruthless allegiance to the average. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 16, 2024 At the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, TN, this summer, Snowden warned the conference’s attendees to vote independently in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which posed major consequences for the future of the crypto industry. He also flagged that governments could use artificial intelligence-powered tools to mine people’s metadata—a much-needed warning at a time when the use of AI tools is gaining traction. Pudgy Penguins CEO and IP owner Luca Netz has built an NFT empire of adorable avian creatures despite a deep downturn in the market for crypto collectibles. Pudgy Penguins’ remarkable growth kicked into high gear with the launch of Webkinz-like Pudgy World in 2024, and it was later helped by the hype around its upcoming Solana-based PENGU token launch. The future is tokenized 🐧 pic.twitter.com/ismhUS5KLW — Luca Netz 🐧✳️ (@LucaNetz) December 8, 2024 Pudgy Penguins’ floor price—meaning the price of a given collection's least valuable token—surged to an all-time high of about $134,000 worth of Ethereum in mid-December, more than tripling in price since the start of the year, CoinGecko data shows. It’s the second most valuable profile picture (PFP) project on the market as of this writing, behind only the influential CryptoPunks. Pudgy Penguins also continued to waddle its way into the hearts of mainstream consumers in 2024, as its real-world toy collection expanded into Walmart, Target, and Walgreens shelves across the U.S. and Canada. In addition to his work on Pudgy Penguins, Netz is also a devoted angel investor to several Web3 projects, including women-led companies such as Chipped. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen has led the world's 11th-largest exchange by daily trading volume since May 2024. And despite the newness of her tenure, Chen is already making her mark. Chen helped the trading platform strike a major deal with Spanish soccer league La Liga, raising the exchange’s profile in Europe and Latin America. And under her leadership, Bitget also expanded its presence in Europe, establishing its first regional hub in Lithuania. The moves are part of the platform's broader strategy to court new users in markets throughout the world. Meanwhile, Chen’s Bitget has promoted the development of the crypto industry through its $100 million “Web3 Fund.” In addition to her work at Bitget, the executive has also spearheaded charitable programs such as Blockchain4Her, an initiative that aims to promote gender inclusivity and diversity in the crypto industry. Chen is also a delegate to the United Nations’ Conference on the Status of Women.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Solar Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best solar energy stocks to buy now. During Joe Biden’s presidency, the U.S. solar industry experienced a significant boost, primarily driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This $369 billion package, signed into law in 2022, has been a game-changer for the renewable energy sector. The IRA provided substantial incentives for renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and investments in clean energy infrastructure. The IRA has also reduced the U.S. reliance on imported energy resources. The economic benefits of the IRA have been widely recognized, with bipartisan support from both Democratic and Republican leaders. According to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published on December 4, the US solar market installed 8.6 GW of capacity in Q3, continuing the trend of record-setting quarterly volumes this year and marking a notable 21% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump’s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems. To compile our list of the 10 best solar energy stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners, clean energy ETFs, and online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 solar energy stocks. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 69 NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in wind and solar power generation. The company operates through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is recognized for its massive investments in clean energy infrastructure and commitment to a sustainable future. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is expanding its renewable energy portfolio by partnering with Phillips 66 to power its refinery in Rodeo, California with a new solar facility. This 30.2-megawatt solar plant, set to begin operations in January 2025, will be built on 88 acres of land adjacent to Phillips 66’s facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. The facility, consisting of more than 70,000 solar modules, is expected to generate around 60,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually. By reducing the refinery’s grid power demand by half and lowering carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 33,000 metric tons per year, the solar plant will play a crucial role in Phillips 66’s transition to more sustainable and renewable energy sources. NextEra Energy Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) expertise in developing and operating large-scale solar projects positions it as a leader in the industry. The company is investing heavily in the development of new solar projects, with a focus on low-cost and battery storage. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has also announced incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts till 2030. Overall, NEE ranks 2nd on our list of best solar energy stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

"The rewiring of globalization is also playing out in reserve currencies," writes Tom Donilon, Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. "As the world divides into competing blocs, and the US and Western governments lean on sanctions and other restrictions, some countries are shifting their reserves out of US dollars into gold and other assets, while increasingly conducting trade finance in non-dollar currencies." "As others have learned through history it is dangerous for private investors to challenge governments. That said, George Soros broke the Bank of England [in 1992] so, perhaps, a firm like BlackRock will believe it can profit from breaking over-leveraged nations that today still have 'hard' fiat currencies," Ortel concludes, referring to the 1992 sterling crisis which was estimated to have cost the British Treasury over $3.7 billion.

Title: Fintech Wrapped: Three Surprising Things That Happened In Fintech In 2024

Fintech wrapped for 2024 It’s always fun to do a retrospective on the year. 2024 was a year of surprises for the fintech sector. Some trends cooled. Others reignited with fervor. From a crypto renaissance in recent months, a continued slow exit environment and important shifts in emerging markets, 2024 was also a year of transformation. Here are three trends that stood out. 2024 witnessed a dramatic rebound in the cryptocurrency market. Despite a recent pull-back, bitcoin hit $100K, shattering previous highs, driven by institutional interest, macroeconomic factors and the US election. Beyond political speculation, one real driver is growing institutional interest. Nearly half of traditional hedge funds reported exposure to digital assets in 2024, up from 29% in 2023. Among these, 33% plan to increase their crypto investments by year's end. Retail investors can now access crypto more easily. U.S. regulators approved several Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock recommends bitcoin portfolio weighting of up to 2% for interested investors. Central banks are also continuing to experiment in the space. Approximately 134 countries, including across the G20, are exploring digital versions of their currencies. Major economies like India and Brazil moved from pilots to early-stage implementation of CBDCs. Perhaps most interesting is that blockchain technology may be finding its first real use case (beyond speculation of future use cases): stablecoins. The market cap of commodity-backed stablecoins hit $1.3 billion as of August 1, 2024. This is being driven by use in ecommerce, remittances and treasury. This was one of the big stories coming out of Money 2020 this year. 2024 was certainly the year crypto came back, with new real applications emerging. Despite signs of economic recovery, fintech IPOs were nearly non-existent. Companies like Stripe and Klarna, expected to go public, opted to delay due to market volatility. However, things might change. A number of companies are predicted to go public in 2025. At Money2020 this year, one of the buzziest topics was who would be the most likely next IPO. Scott Sanborn predicted Stripe and Chime (which received a few other votes) as likely candidates, while Sandy Kimura of Money Forward suggested Klarna and Plaid (note Chime is a former portfolio company). Despite the dearth of IPOs, the exit markets were still active, particularly in strategically minded M&A transactions and other deals. The most significant deals were in the payments sector, including Capital One Financial Corp.'s $35 billion proposal to acquire Discover Financial Services and an investor group's $5.04 billion plan to take Canadian payments firm Nuvei Corp. private. Crypto & stable coins were also not left out. BRD-GE, a stablecoin infrastructure provider was acquired by Stripe for over a billion. 2024 reaffirmed that innovation thrives outside traditional hubs, particularly in emerging ecosystems. Emerging market fintech innovation is arguably most strongly seen today by the government. Real-time money transfers continue their march forward in emerging market – like India, Brazil and now a handful of other markets. The impact is clear. McKinsey & Co predicts the cash economy in many emerging markets like India, will decline from 23% today to less than 10% within this decade. Emerging markets have created regional powerhouses. Nubank is among the largest neobanks. Jio is building a multibillion-dollar ecosystem in India. Many are expanding across markets. Dlocal for example has scaled across South America, Africa, and Asia. We will see more of this over time. A number of sectors cooled, while others heated up. ESG-focused fintechs struggled as investor focus shifted away from sustainable investments, particularly in light of disappointing financial returns in 2023. Conversely, generative AI became fintech’s darling, driving personalized financial services, fraud detection, and operational automation. Examples include OpenAI’s collaboration with major banks for automated underwriting models. What I enjoyed was the comeback stories. For example, companies like Root and Dave, once fintech darlings, found themselves in the doldrums at the beginning of the year. In January, Root traded under $10/share (down from over $350 at its peak). The company grew its stock price 7x this year to over $70 as of writing. Hippo, the home insurance provider, similarly scaled from under 10 to nearly $30 today (source Yahoo Finance). 2024 was a year of unexpected twists in fintech. But like some of the stock and crypto prices, fintech has gone from down-and-out category, to a core investment area. As we look to 2025, the stage is set for further surprises in an industry that never stays static for long.

Title: Why New Gold Inc. (NGD) Is One of the Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) stands against other best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. The U.S. Federal Reserve now anticipates just two interest rate cuts next year, a reduction from the four previously forecasted in September, due to inflation concerns and the potential economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs. On November 18, in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, the U.S. dollar surged, with the dollar index reaching a two-year high. This rally placed downward pressure on gold prices, which fell 2% to their lowest levels in a month. Traditionally, a stronger dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields make gold less attractive as an investment. However, analysts suggest that these traditional relationships between gold, the dollar, and interest rates have become less predictable in recent years. In an interview with CNBC on December 18, Thomas Rupf, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading at VP Bank Asia provided detailed insights into the current market conditions and future projections for the U.S. dollar and gold. Rupf acknowledged the resilience of the U.S. dollar and attributed it to the perception of the continued strength of the U.S. economy. However, he also pointed out that the U.S. dollar is currently overvalued and expects the US economy to slow down, which could contribute to a weaker US dollar by the end of next year. Regarding gold, Rupf is optimistic and noted that the potential slowdown in the US economy and dollar as well as the ongoing trend of de-dollarization are all bullish factors for gold prices. He mentioned that ETF flows, which are still 20% below historical levels, indicate that there is significant room for retail investors to increase their investment in gold ETFs. Rupf concluded by agreeing that gold prices could realistically reach $2,800 to $2,900. He also mentioned the possibility of gold reaching up to $3,000, which he considers the top end of his forecast. Gold has historically been recognized as a reliable investment, known for its enduring value and resilience against economic uncertainties. This precious metal has been a cornerstone in many diversified investment portfolios, offering a sense of security and stability in times of financial turmoil. To compile our list of the 10 best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, financing, or sale of gold and have a market capitalization between $200 million and $10 billion as of December 23. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23 Market Capitalization as of December 23: $1.98 Billion New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is a prominent intermediate gold mining company with a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets across North America. The company operates two flagship mines: Rainy River in Ontario, Canada, and New Afton in British Columbia, Canada. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) prioritizes exploration to generate additional value and extend the operational life of its mines. At Rainy River, the company has identified promising opportunities in the main pit and several smaller satellite pits. These prospects could further extend the open-pit mine’s life while minimizing capital expenditures. At New Afton mine, New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is focusing on optimizing the C-Zone, the fourth block cave at the mine, and advancing the technical study for the East Extension, which has the potential to introduce a high-grade zone in the mine’s eastern section. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is also advancing several critical projects aimed at boosting production capacity and improving cost efficiency. At the C-Zone, the company has successfully commissioned the gyratory crusher and conveyor system, eliminating the need for truck haulage. At the Rainy River Mine, efforts are concentrated on developing the Underground Main Zone, the second and much larger sector of the mine compared to Intrepid. The Underground Main Zone is slated to begin production in the first half of 2025 and is expected to ramp up to processing 5,500 tonnes of gold ore per day by 2027. Overall, NGD ranks 2nd on our list of best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NGD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Serious $4.1 Trillion 2025 Fed Warning Sparks $20,000 Bitcoin Price Crash Fear

Bitcoin has dropped back from its all-time high of over $100,000 in the last week as BlackRock quietly confirmed a worrying bitcoin bombshell. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plunged toward $90,000 per bitcoin, with the Federal Reserve's "biggest nightmare" weighing on the crypto market. Now, as Donald Trump confirms he has huge plans for bitcoin, a financial analyst has warned a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply could be about to trigger a bitcoin price crash of $20,000. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has overseen a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply, ... [+] something some fear could cause a bitcoin price crash. "In the past, bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag," analysts with The Kobeissi Letter posted to X, asking: "Is bitcoin overdue for a correction?" Kobeissi analysts pointed to the money supply dropping by $4.1 trillion, to $104.4 trillion, the lowest since August, after hitting a peak of $108.5 trillion in October. "If the relationship still holds, this suggests that bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin's red hot run may take a pause." The Federal Reserve, which controls the money supply through monetary policy, has been fighting to keep a lid on inflation this year while also attempting to bring down interest rates to prevent the economy falling into recession. Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by a well-telegraphed 25 basis points despite prices beginning to rise again but signaled it will move more slowly along next year's expected path of rate cuts. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged to record highs of over $100,000 per bitcoin this year, a huge rally ... [+] that's led to fears of a looming bitcoin price crash. The Fed's "economic outlook and chair Powell's press conference suggested that inflation is going to be stickier than previously thought. This means that they will proceed with the current rate cut cycle slowly and with caution to inflation, which seems to be re-accelerating for the past couple of months," Yuya Hasegawa, bitcoin and crypto market analyst with Tokyo-based Bitbank, said in emailed comments. "There also is a chance for Fed to stop cutting rates sometime during 2025 if inflation becomes too hot, and in the worst case scenario, they might start raising again. Monetary easing has almost always favored the price of bitcoin, and the opposite has negative impact on the price." U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." "While Fed's potential policy shift will likely put pressure on bitcoin, high interest rates will keep pressure on the government's debt payments as well," Hasegawa said. "The ballooning Federal government debt is already raising the question about its sustainability and the government's credibility could gradually become one of the topics that the market will pay attention to in 2025."

Title: Elon Musk's xAI raises $6 billion in fresh funding: 'We are gonna need a bigger compute!'

Elon Musk's xAI has completed its Series C funding round, raising a total of $6 billion, it revealed in a Monday blog post. Musk's artificial intelligence company said the participants included a16z, Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings, Oman and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds, California-based Lightspeed Venture Partners, Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital, and UAE-based tech investor MGX. xAI added that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD took part as strategic investors and "continue to support xAI in rapidly scaling our infrastructure." Musk shared the news on his X platform, writing, "A lot of compute is needed." He also tagged xAI in a meme generated by xAI's Grok chatbot that riffed on a famous line from the movie "Jaws." “We are gonna need a bigger compute!”@xAI https://t.co/ckc78vJhL6 Musk was likely underscoring the vast amount of processing power needed to train and run AI models, which has fueled enormous demand for microchips and underpinned a roughly eightfold rise in Nvidia stock since the start of 2023. xAI, founded in March last year, raised $6 billion at a post-money valuation of $24 billion in its Series B round in May. The Wall Street Journal reported in late November that it had raised a further $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation. It appears xAI ultimately raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but the valuation wasn't disclosed. The startup highlighted its progress since May in its blog post, including its launch of Colossus — the world's largest AI supercomputer powered by 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, which xAI plans to double in size to 200,000 chips soon. xAI also released version two of Grok, an application programming interface (API) for developers to build on its platform, its Aurora image generation model for Grok, and Grok on X. The company said it's training Grok 3 and "focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products that will leverage the power of Grok, Colossus, and X to transform the way we live, work, and play." Musk's fledgling business said it would use the Series C funds to accelerate its infrastructure growth, ship new products, and speed up its research and development of tech that will enable its "mission to understand the true nature of the universe."

Title: House Judiciary Committee sends letters to investment firms tied to ‘woke ESG cartel’

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2024 2:23:00 AM PST by Libloather The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee took aim at a group of US asset managers over their involvement with a “woke ESG cartel” — adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. The committee, chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting three fund managers — BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action 100+.

ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Vanguard is unique in that it is owned by its shareholders, meaning the investors in its funds. Unlike traditional for-profit investment firms, Vanguard operates as a mutual company, where the company itself is owned by the funds it manages, and those funds are in turn owned by the investors in those funds. This structure allows Vanguard to focus on benefiting its investors, as the profits from the company are used to reduce costs for fund shareholders rather than being paid out to external shareholders or owners.

Title: Jim Cramer on Reddit (RDDT): ‘I Don’t Know What To Do About It’

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a latest program analyzed why Wall Street missed the Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) rally and how the company defies conventional valuation models. “It has a tremendous business model that could change the entire Defense Department budget, but in some ways, Palantir is a renegade company playing by its own rules. Like AMC, the theater chain, the CEO actually caters not to Wall Street but to Main Street individual investors. What makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins.

A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently published a list of 10 Biggest Gainers of Last Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) stands against other biggest gainers of last week. Investors gobbled up shares of predominantly technology companies last week, following announcements of multi-billion dollars of investments, quantum technology backing, and new contracts, among others. Let’s take a look at last week’s Top 10 Gainers and explore the reasons behind their impressive performance. To come up with the biggest winners of last week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A data analyst pouring over a chart, the intricacies of its lines being revealed. Shares of Quantum Computing posted the highest gains in last week’s trading, recording a whopping 147 percent to end at $17.62 apiece on Friday versus the $7.12 registered on Monday. Quantum Computing posted notable gains last week after announcements that the company secured a contract from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center for its imaging technology called Dirac-3. Financial terms were not disclosed. Similar to IonQ and Rigetti, Quantum Computing posted notable gains following news of further advancements in the quantum industry, led by Google’s Willow chip. Momentum for quantum computing is also accelerating fast, with US lawmakers announcing a $2.7 billion government funding to supercharge quantum innovation across computing, sensing, and communications. Overall, QUBT ranks 1st on our list of biggest gainers of last week. While we acknowledge the potential of QUBT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: People With Extreme Wealth Should Give It Away—or Be Penalized

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED In 2024, wealth concentration rose to an all-time high. According to Forbes’ Billionaires List, not only are there more billionaires than ever—2,781—but those billionaires are also richer than ever, with an aggregate worth of $14.2 trillion. This is a trend that looks set to continue unabated. A recent report from the financial data company Altrata estimated that about 1.2 million individuals who are worth more than $5 million will pass on a collective wealth of almost $31 trillion over the next decade. Discontentment and concern over the consequences of extreme wealth in our society is growing. Senator Bernie Sanders, for instance, stated that the “obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue.” In a joint op-ed for CNN in 2023, Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee and Disney heiress Abigail Disney wrote that “extreme wealth inequality is a threat to our economy and democracy.” In 2024, when the board of Tesla put to vote a $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk, some major shareholders voted against it, declaring that such a compensation level was “absurd” and “ridiculous.” In 2025, the fight against rising wealth inequality will be high on the political agenda. In July 2024, the G20—the world’s 20 biggest economies—agreed to work on a proposal by Brazil to introduce a new global “billionaire tax” that would levy a 2 percent tax on assets worth more than $1 billion. This would raise an estimated $250 billion a year. While this specific proposal was not endorsed in the Rio declaration, the G20 countries agreed that the super rich should be taxed more. Progressive politicians won’t be the only ones trying to address this problem. In 2025, millionaires themselves will increasingly mobilize and put pressure on political leaders. One such movement is Patriotic Millionaires, a nonpartisan group of multimillionaires who are already publicly campaigning and privately lobbying the American Congress for a guaranteed living wage for all, a fair tax system, and the protection of equal representation. “Millionaires and large corporations—who have benefited most from our country’s assets—should pay a larger percentage of the tab for running the country,” reads their value statement. Members include Abigail Disney, former BlackRock executive Morris Pearl, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig, screenwriter Norman Lear, and investor Lawrence Benenson. This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. Another example is TaxMeNow, a lobby group founded in 2021 by young multimillionaires in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland which also advocates for higher wealth taxation. Its most famous member is the 32-year old Marlene Engelhorn, descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, founder of German pharma giant BASF. She recently set up a council made up of 50 randomly selected Austrian citizens to decide what should happen to her €25 million inheritance. “I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,” she said in a statement. “If politicians don’t do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself.” Earlier this year, Patriotic Millionaires, TaxMeNow, Oxfam, and another activist group called Millionaires For Humanity formed a coalition called Proud to Pay More, and addressed a letter to global leaders during the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Signed by hundreds of high-net-worth individuals—including heiress Valerie Rockefeller, actor Simon Pegg, and filmmaker Richard Curtis—the letter stated: “We all know that ‘trickle down economics’ has not translated into reality. Instead it has given us stagnating wages, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, and destabilized the very institution of democracy.” It concluded: “We ask you to take this necessary and inevitable step before it’s too late. Make your countries proud. Tax extreme wealth.” In 2025, thanks to the nascent movement of activist millionaires, these calls will grow even louder.

After failing to convince OpenAI executives of his plans, Elon Musk started his own AI startup, xAI. Over the past several months, xAI has aggressively pursued funding to support its rapid growth and ambitious goals in the competitive AI landscape. In May, xAI announced its Series B funding round of $6 billion. Last night, xAI announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of $6 billion. Popular VC firms including A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital participated in this funding round. xAI also announced that NVIDIA and AMD participated in the round as strategic investors that will help them rapidly scale their AI infrastructure. As expected, xAI will use the funds to further improve its computing infrastructure, develop products, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies. xAI is also hiring aggressively to pursue its mission. Since its Series B announcement in May of this year, xAI has made the following progress: With this substantial investment, xAI is well-positioned to compete with other major players including OpenAI, Google and Meta in the AI landscape. It will be interesting to see how they utilize these funds to innovate and advance their technology in the coming months.

Title: Jim Cramer on Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (LW): ‘Look, This Company Was Doing Better Than Its Spin-off Would Have Been’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 17 Stocks After The Fed's Rate Cut. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that "We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation," and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four. In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome"a new phase in the process." He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him "Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it." Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was "The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant." Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's "message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish." The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. "Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man," said Cramer. He added "But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have." According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team "shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys," as he believes that "he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together." Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell "Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown." Building on the comments, the next day he outlined "There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher." Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped." As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has "done nothing but build up" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where "the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea." Situations like these make him "think that we've been taken advantage of." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired the day after the Fed's rate cut. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Potatoes being sorted on a conveyor belt in a modern packing facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is a well-known American firm that sells french fries. It is one of the worst-performing stocks on the market in 2024 as the shares are down 42% year-to-date. Like Conagra, the firm has struggled with declining volumes due to consumers struggling with high inflation. However, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) has also dealt with rising potato prices, which a lawsuit claims stems from due actions of a 'potato cartel.' The firm is also purportedly part of this cartel. US potato production dropped to a new low since 2010 by June 2024 and prices had surged by 36%. Cramer's comments around Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) revolved around management changes forced by activist investor Jana Partners: "What do they think the financial results are? What are the financial results of this man coming in. . . .of this change, the COO coming in [AS CEO]? . . . Disastrous! "Look, this company was doing better than its spin-off would have been, the company was spun off from Conagra. Uh, and I always felt, but hold on, wait a second, maybe Conagra should have kept french fries but in the end this is a company that is now worth $9 billion versus $12 billion when Conagra completely reversed. There was some way to make this company better. And you don't pick the guy who is part of the regime. Overall LW ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of LW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 17 Stocks After The Fed's Rate Cut. In this article, we are going to take a look at where D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that "We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation," and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four. In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome"a new phase in the process." He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him "Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it." Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was "The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant." Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's "message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish." The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. "Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man," said Cramer. He added "But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have." According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team "shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys," as he believes that "he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together." Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell "Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown." Building on the comments, the next day he outlined "There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher." Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped." As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has "done nothing but build up" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where "the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea."

(NYSE:QBTS) is a Canadian firm that designs and sells quantum computing systems and provides a quantum-as-a-service (QaaS) platform. The stock is up 227% over the past month due to Google's Willow chip which injected fresh life into the quantum computing industry. Willow demonstrated the ability to solve a problem that would have taken a supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. However, Cramer isn't a fan of quantum computing as is evident through his remarks: "these companies, can I just say, when you have GE Vernova saying listen I love to do nuke but I can't. And they are the biggest nuke company in the world. How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don't even know what quantum is? It's a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?" Overall QBTS ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of QBTS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI announced Monday it had raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, with backing from major investors including BlackRock, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and other high-profile investors. Strategic investors NVIDIA and AMD also participated in the round, continuing their support for xAI’s infrastructure scaling efforts. The funding round was exclusive to xAI’s existing investors, many of whom had previously supported Musk’s acquisition of X, according to Financial Times. The latest financing, first revealed through a SEC filing last week, brings xAI’s total funding to $12 billion. It follows a previous $6 billion round completed earlier in 2024. According to CNBC, Musk’s AI business targets a valuation of around $50 billion, which would double its valuation six months ago. The fresh capital will be used to support the research and development of xAI’s generative AI model, Grok, and to expand its infrastructure, the team shared in the announcement. Since its Series B funding in May 2024, xAI has launched several key initiatives, including Colossus, which it describes as “the world’s largest AI supercomputer,” Grok 2, and the xAI API for developers. The company also introduced Aurora, its proprietary image generation model, and integrated Grok with the X platform to provide real-time information processing capabilities. xAI is currently training Grok 3, which it calls its “most powerful model yet.” The company aims for it to be comparable to or even surpass OpenAI’s GPT-5, with a focus on enhancing its capabilities in natural language understanding, image generation, and coding tasks. Musk anticipates that Grok 3 will be launched by the end of this year. Following its release, xAI plans to expand its infrastructure to include 200,000 GPUs, with the potential to scale up to as many as 300,000 GPUs in the future.

Title: Christmas walks: 10 family-friendly trails around Ireland, from easy to challenging
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/your-fitness/2024/12/24/christmas-walks-10-family-friendly-trails-around-ireland-from-easy-to-challenging/

Expensive and demanding, Christmas sells itself by creating expectations of a relaxing time coalescing seamlessly with everyone. In reality, there is pressure to finish work, find the right gifts, remember every relative, and then being cooped with family for days. Yet, few would be without it, for it is also when we step off the treadmill to put family, friends and simpler things before competition and achievement. This is when quietness envelopes the landscape as nature takes a breather at a time when the outdoors are mostly shrouded in moody but atmospheric half-light. It makes it the perfect time to escape the embrace of domesticity and let your seasonal stresses melt away on one of the bracing family walks listed below. The town, which possesses some of Ireland’s finest medieval walls, is undergoing a transformation in recent times with the captivating Fethard Horse Country Experience and the spanking new dining destination at Sadler’s Restaurant and Bar. An innovative sports and recreation campus has also been created that offers 4G and grass pitches along with a gym and cosy cafe. Titled Fethard Town Park, it also boasts a 2km walkway around the perimeter. With an excellent surface for buggies or wheelchairs, this makes a perfect outdoor excursion for even the most inclement December day. Another outing offering a good surface, this walk is entirely within Cork city. This may seem off-putting, but it shouldn’t, for this is a varied outing offering much to fascinate. Starting from the riverside Marina car park, continue through Marina Park and on by Páirc Uí Chaoimh and Holland Park. Join a public road with the slow-flowing river Lee to your left. After a short distance, follow Castle Road left to reach Blackrock Castle, a 16th-century fortification, which is now an observatory. Onward next along a lovely riverside path for about 3km with sublime views across the water. Pass Joe McHugh Park and then cross a causeway. Go right along a sylvan path following the track bed of the old Passage Railway. Cross a footbridge above the South Ring Road and finish along an attractive 3km greenway leading back to Marina Park. Despite the hordes who descend on it year-round, Glendalough still exudes a mysterious and haunting quality that unmistakably denotes it as a special place. For a gentle introduction to this deep and sheltered valley, start from the Visitor Centre car park, by crossing a stream and following a green road past the famous monastery founded by St Kevin. Push past the Lower Lake to Glendalough’s upper car park. Turn right and follow the supremely tranquil waterside before going right again, and continuing along a boardwalk. Follow the north shore of the lower lake and finish on a Green Road leading to your start point, having walked just over 3km in about one hour. Located just off the N77 Kilkenny-to-Ballyragget road, Jenkinstown Estate, is where Thomas Moore penned his most famous poem The Last Rose of Summer. Despite its rather melancholic final verse, it became hugely popular and was soon being performed more often as a song. [ Winter walks: Eight picturesque trails with places to eat and drink at the endOpens in new window ] The great house, where Moore stayed is just a memory, but within the surrounding parklands you can still discover where the bard found inspiration by exploring the atmospheric woodlands that provide shelter on an imperfect day. The Walled Garden Loop (2km) and the slightly longer Jenkinstown Loop (3km) offer the perfect outing for families, with young children or buggies, wishing to wrap up and get out on an easy Christmas stroll. The distinctive landscape of Co Sligo has drawn visitors for generations to its multitude of accessible visitor attractions. But there is something especially rewarding about getting off the obvious tourist trail and capturing a modest hilltop. Located just west of Sligo town, Knocknarea is an eminence that simply drips with history and takes just a half-hour to ascend on an easy path. But the rewards are out of proportion to effort. The summit is adorned by a huge cairn, which is reputedly the burial pace of Connacht’s Queen Maeve and also offers a wonderful 360 view to Donegal Bay, Ben Bulben and the timeless Sligo landscape with Strandhill immediately below. Returning from the summit, you can regale the family with stories of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, when Maeve attempted to steal Ulster’s prize bull, Donn Cúailnge. This gentle 4.5km outing starts from Cadamstown by following the Slieve Bloom Way and blue arrows uphill along an old coach road before swinging to a rustic track known as Paul’s Lane. Onwards past the sombre remnants of the deserted Bordingstown village before parting company with the Slieve Bloom Way at a point offering views towards the deliciously named Wolftrap Mountain. Right and downhill, following the blue arrows and then through a gateway to continue across a Mass path that once conveyed mountain folk to worship. Next, tag a stream known locally as Purcell’s Brook to reach a beguiling little weir. Beyond, a stile leads to a spectacular path traversing the banks of the Silver river. Here the hurrying waters descend over pretty waterfalls and eddies, which can be viewed from the trail. Eventually abandoning the river, the path ascends to a wooden stile accessing farmland before turning left on to a bucolic laneway that ambles downhill to the trailhead. From the Nire Valley car park, which is located about 10km east of Ballymacarbery Village, follow the white poles marking an ancient trade route that once bisected the Comeraghs. Gain a low saddle between Knockanaffrin (Mass Mountain) and the immense Comeragh plateau, which is known locally as the Gap. Here, enchanting views will open up over the great flatlands of Waterford and Kilkenny to the distant outline of the Blackstairs Mountains. If you have enough for today, you can now retrace your steps to the Nire Valley car park after a two-hour outing. If you want to segue to a more challenging outing, swing northwest and ascend the Knockanaffrin Ridge, which rises in undemanding steps like a benign staircase to reach a level section above an attractive tear-shaped tarn known as Coumduala. From here, swing left and descend southwest by following a helpful fence and purple arrows to regain the trailhead after about three hours. [ Markets in Vienna or Christmas at The Shelbourne? 10 holiday escapes over the festive seasonOpens in new window ] If you really want to get the heart rate going, head for the parking place by the Graves of Leinstermen, lying about 6km north from the Tipperary village of Ballina. This unusual conclave of stones reputedly dates from Brian Boru’s kingship of Munster, when he supposedly showed himself the ultimate father-in-law from hell by massacring the King of Leinster’s entourage as they travelled to request Brian’s daughter in matrimony. Myths rearrange facts, however; this site is actually Bronze Age and predates Brian by about 2,000 years. Here, a zigzag path labours steeply up Tountinna (Hill of the Wave) – named after a biblical flood that reputedly drowned Ireland’s first inhabitants. One survivor was Fionntán, who cannily took refuge high on Tountinna. You will reach the ugly communications masts that adorn the summit in a little over a half-hour. Look beyond these, however, and you are compensated with mesmeric views over the opalescent waters of Lough Derg to the shimmering Clare Hills beyond. Return by your route of ascent. A magnificent swirl of naked limestone, Mullaghmore is a jewel even within the Burren’s rich treasury. From Corofin, take the Kilfenora Road, go right at Kilnaboy and right again at a parking place. Start your walk by following arrows from the roadside at Lough Gealáin where fossilised skeletons embedded within the limestone will fascinate younger folk and prove that the Burren originated as an ocean floor aeons ago. As you ascend, point to an isolated house; the kids will instantly recognise this as Father Ted’s bleakly unadorned dwelling from the eponymous soap opera. An enjoyable scramble leads to the summit, where a great panorama unfolds. Mullaghmore could truthfully be described as Ireland’s biggest little mountain; despite its modest stature, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the views from loftier eminences such as Carrauntoohil and Errigal. Return to the trailhead by your ascent route after about 2.5 hours. Another mountain that punches above its modest height by offering panromantic views along with rocky summit tors. Begin from the car park on Sandbank Road, lying southeast of Hilltown off the Kilkeel Road. Cross the road and follow the lane for 500m and then go through a gate and tag an informal, grassy track to the left as it rises to a conversation-killing 220m. It’s a short upward flog, however, and soon two tors signal your approach to the summit. Pass left of these and continue straight ahead to gain the Summit Tor. Here, young people will love scrambling (with supervision) to the top, which is renowned for its sublime views, particularly at sunset. Afterwards, descend to the trailhead after an outing of about 1.5 hours. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

(NYSE: HYT), BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE: BTZ), BlackRock Limited Duration Income Trust (NYSE: BLW), BlackRock Core Bond Trust (NYSE: BHK) and BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (NYSE: BIT) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.

Title: BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (MUI) Provides De-Listing and Conversion Dates for Upcoming Conversion to Unlisted Continuously-Offered Closed-End Fund

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) is providing additional information related to the Fund's upcoming conversion from an exchange-listed closed-end fund to an unlisted continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts quarterly repurchases of its shares (the Conversion) and will operate under the name BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Municipal Credit Alpha Portfolio, Inc. (the Interval Fund). It is currently anticipated that the Conversion will take place after the close of business on March 21, 2025, and be effective on March 24, 2025 (the Conversion Date). Delisting From the New York Stock Exchange In connection with the Conversion, the Fund intends to delist its shares of common stock (MUI Shares) from the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the close of business on February 14, 2025 (the Delisting Date). Please note that, effective as of the Delisting Date, the MUI Shares will no longer trade on the NYSE or any other securities exchange. The Conversion Date and the Delisting Date are subject to change. Any such changes will be announced via press release. Conversion and First Periodic Repurchase MUI Shares held on the Conversion Date will be redesignated as Institutional Shares of the Interval Fund (Interval Fund Shares). The Interval Fund Shares will not be listed for trading on any securities exchange and a secondary market is not expected to develop for the Interval Fund Shares. As a result, an investment in the Interval Fund is not a liquid investment. Shareholders will generally only be able to sell their Interval Fund Shares through the Interval Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the outstanding Interval Fund Shares. The Interval Fund currently intends to commence the initial repurchase offer in the second quarter of 2025. Although the Interval Fund intends to conduct quarterly repurchase offers, such repurchase offers may be oversubscribed. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, the Interval Fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis, and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the Interval Fund through a particular repurchase offer. Shareholders will be subject to the risk of NAV fluctuations and other investment-related risks during that period. Important Notice to Shareholders Who Hold Shares Through a Financial Intermediary Following the Conversion, the Interval Fund will offer one or more classes of shares through select financial intermediaries. Shareholders should be aware that not all financial intermediaries will offer to sell shares of the Interval Fund or support quarterly repurchase offers by the Interval Fund. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CONTACT THEIR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THEIR INTERMEDIARY WILL SUPPORT QUARTERLY REPURCHASE OFFERS AND WHAT, IF ANY, EFFECT THE CONVERSION WILL HAVE ON THE SHAREHOLDER'S ACCOUNT.

Elon Musk’s xAI announced Monday it raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, putting the company’s value at more than $40 billion as it continues to strengthen its AI products and infrastructure. The funding round was announced Monday. (Photo by Muhammed Selim Korkutata/Anadolu via Getty Images) The company closed the $6 billion round and said the funding would be allocated toward products and infrastructure, likely referring to its Grok AI model and the multibillion-dollar supercomputer site in Memphis, Tennessee, used to train its AI models. Investors included Blackrock, A16Z, Saudi conglomerate holding company Kingdom Holding, Fidelity and Sequoia Capital, the latter three of which participated in xAI’s $6 billion Series B funding round in May. The latest funding round puts xAI’s valuation over $40 billion at least, as multiple reports have placed the value of Musk’s company at $40 billion or $50 billion. xAI said in its funding announcement it is training Grok 3, which is not yet available and was slated for release by the end of the year, according to a tweet from Musk in June.

That is how much money xAI has raised this year from their Series B and Series C funding rounds, which included investors such as Morgan Stanley, Kingdom Holding, Andreessen Horowitz, chip designer Nvidia and semiconductor firm AMD. xAI has spent 2024 building its AI language models and the supercomputer used to train them. The computer, dubbed “Colossus,” features 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units used to train AI and will eventually be doubled in size, allowing it to take on a significantly high training workload. Sam Altman, the CEO of xAI competitor OpenAI, lauded the short time needed to get the supercomputer operational and said during The New York Times DealBook Summit he assumes Musk’s firm will become “a really serious competitor” (OpenAI so far exceeds xAI’s value with a massive $157 billion valuation). Grok 2, xAI’s AI model, is available to users on X, formerly known as Twitter, though it does not yet operate on a standalone app the same way OpenAI’s ChatGPT does. Grok 3 will reportedly boast more computing power and improved responsiveness of its predecessor, according to the chatbot.

The company announced this week that Andreessen Horowitz , Blackrock, Fidelity, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Nvidia, AMD, and others participated. Kingdom Holdings, the Saudi conglomerate holding company, invested roughly $400 million in the round, according to a public filing. The filing also revealed that xAI is now valued at $45 billion, close to double its previous valuation. The new cash brings xAI’s total raised to $12 billion, adding to the $6 billion tranche xAI raised in May. According to the Financial Times, only investors who’d backed xAI in its previous fundraising round were permitted to participate in this one. Reportedly, investors who helped finance Musk’s Twitter acquisition were given access to up to 25% of xAI’s shares. “xAI’s most powerful model yet … is currently training and we are now focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products,” xAI said in a statement. “The funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure, ship groundbreaking products … and accelerate … research and development.” Musk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, a flagship generative AI model that now powers a number of features on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium subscribers and free users in some regions. Grok has what Musk has described as “a rebellious streak” — a willingness to answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from ChatGPT. Musk has derided ChatGPT and other AI systems for being too “woke” and “politically correct,” despite Grok’s own unwillingness to cross certain boundaries and hedge on political subjects. He’s also referred to Grok as “maximally truth-seeking” and less biased than competing models, although there’s evidence to suggest that Grok leans to the left. Over the past year, Grok has become increasingly ingrained in X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. At launch, Grok was only available to X users — and developers skilled enough to get the “open source” edition up and running. Thanks to an integration with xAI’s in-house image generation model, Aurora, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). The model can analyze images as well, and summarize news and trending events — imperfectly, mind. Reports indicate that Grok may handle even more X functions in the future, from enhancing X’s search capabilities and account bios to helping with post analytics and reply settings. X recently got a “Grok button” designed to help users discover “relevant context” and dive deeper into trending discussions and real-time events. xAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. The company launched an API in October, allowing customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services. And it just rolled out a standalone Grok iOS app to a test audience. Musk asserts that it hasn’t been a fair fight. In a lawsuit filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, OpenAI’s close collaborator, attorneys for Musk accuse OpenAI of “actively trying to eliminate competitors” like xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.” OpenAI, Musk’s counsel says, also unfairly benefits from Microsoft’s infrastructure and expertise in what the attorneys describe as a “de facto merger.” Yet Musk often says that X’s data gives xAI a leg up compared to rivals. Last month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts. Musk, it’s worth noting, was one of the original founders of OpenAI, and left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction. He’s argued in previous suits that OpenAI profited from his early involvement yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. OpenAI, unsurprisingly, disagrees with Musk’s interpretation of events. In a mid-December press release, the company characterized Musk’s lawsuit as misleading, baseless, and a case of sour grapes. xAI has outlined a vision according to which its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and the models could then improve technology across those companies. xAI is already powering customer support for SpaceX’s Starlink internet service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the startup is said to be in talks with Tesla to provide R&D in exchange for some of the carmaker’s revenue. Tesla shareholders, for one, object to these plans. Several have sued Musk over his decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what’s essentially a competing venture. Nevertheless, the deals — and xAI’s developer and consumer-facing products — have driven xAI’s revenue to around $100 million a year. For comparison, Anthropic is reportedly on pace to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, and OpenAI is targeting $4 billion by the end of 2024. Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which was apparently built in just 122 days and is currently powered partly by portable diesel generators. The company hopes to upgrade the server farm, which contains 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, next year; in a press release, xAI said it plans to fully double that number. (Because of their ability to perform many calculations in parallel, GPUs are the favored chips for training and running models.) In November, xAI won approval from the regional power authority in Memphis for 150MW of additional power — enough to power roughly 100,000 homes. To win the agency over, xAI pledged to improve the quality of the city’s drinking water and provide the Memphis grid with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries. But some residents criticized the move, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen the area’s air quality. Tesla is also expected to use the upgraded data center to improve its autonomous driving technologies. xAI has expanded quite rapidly from an operations standpoint in the year since its founding, growing from just a dozen employees in March 2023 to over 100 today. In October, the startup moved into OpenAI’s old corporate offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. xAI has reportedly told investors it plans to raise more money next year. It won’t be the only AI lab raising immense cash. Anthropic recently secured $4 billion from Amazon, bringing its total raised to $13.7 billion, while OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October to grow its war chest to $17.9 billion. Megadeals like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s drove AI venture capital activity to $31.1 billion across over 2,000 deals in Q3 2024, per PitchBook data. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Title: The Protocol: Trump Makes More Pro-Crypto Appointments

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. In this week’s issue of the Protocol newsletter: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. TRUMP CRYPTO APPOINTMENTS: President-elect Donald Trump continues to make high-profile appointments embracing cryptocurrency and emerging technologies in his second term. 1) Stephen Miran, tapped as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is a pro-crypto advocate who aims to integrate blockchain and decentralized finance into the U.S. economy. 2) Bo Hines, a former college football player, will head the newly formed Crypto Council. Hines is tasked with balancing innovation and consumer protection as he builds a regulatory framework for digital assets. 3) David Sacks, a veteran of Silicon Valley and vocal blockchain supporter, is stepping in as AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks plans to merge blockchain with AI while bolstering U.S. dominance in both sectors. These appointments signal a clear shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism of digital assets. The big question now is how these moves translate into meaningful policy amid regulatory gridlock and political friction. APTOS LEADERSHIP SHIFT: Aptos Labs CEO and co-founder Mo Shaikh has stepped down, with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Shaikh, who will remain a strategic adviser, highlighted the company's achievements, including raising $400 million in venture funding and building a thriving ecosystem supported by partners like BlackRock, Google, Mastercard, and PayPal. Known for its layer-1 blockchain leveraging the Move programming language from Facebook's Diem project, Aptos Labs is expanding into finance and AI applications with the help of advisers like former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI’s Kevin Weil. The leadership transition underscores the company’s ongoing focus on scalability, security, and innovation in blockchain technology. SONIC TO AIRDROP TIKTOK: Sonic, a Layer 2 solution on the Solana blockchain, has announced plans to airdrop its native token, SONIC, to TikTok users. This initiative aims to introduce TikTok's vast user base to decentralized finance (DeFi) by integrating blockchain technology with social media platforms. The airdrop is part of Sonic's strategy to enhance user engagement and promote the adoption of Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and reduced transaction costs on the Solana network. By targeting TikTok users, Sonic seeks to bridge the gap between mainstream social media audiences and the DeFi ecosystem, fostering broader participation in decentralized financial services. ALSO: Kraken, the seventh-largest crypto exchange, said its layer-2 rollup network, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has gone live. The network, called Ink, is based on the OP stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule. Kraken agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens (worth about $58 million) as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has acknowledged that handing out developer grants for participants building on the stack is part of its strategy, which in turn contributes back to the wider “Superchain” ecosystem.Kraken competitor Coinbase said in August 2023 that it would build a layer-2 network with OP Stack. The product, called Base, is now the second-largest rollup network according to L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens and, in return, would contribute the higher of 2.5% of its sequencer revenue or 15% of its profits to the Optimism Collective. Read the full story by Margaux Nijkerk here Fundraising Deals & Grants Data & Tokens Hyper Liquid, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on perpetual contracts, has reported a record outflow of $60 million in USDC amid speculation that North Korea is investigating the platform. The sudden exodus of funds raises questions about the exchange’s liquidity and the stability of its operations. This highlights the growing tension of crypto markets with geopolitical issues, as regulatory scrutiny and potential misuse of platforms by state actors come into focus. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities in crypto markets, particularly for exchanges dealing with high-risk financial products like perpetual contracts. Hyper Liquid’s situation may prompt further scrutiny of similar platforms, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards in the face of increasing global regulatory pressure.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Biggest Gainers of Last Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) stands against other biggest gainers of last week. Investors gobbled up shares of predominantly technology companies last week, following announcements of multi-billion dollars of investments, quantum technology backing, and new contracts, among others. Let’s take a look at last week’s Top 10 Gainers and explore the reasons behind their impressive performance. To come up with the biggest winners of last week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Similar to Rigetti, quantum computing investors continued to watch out closely for clues on industry developments. Over the past year, IonQ’s stock prices registered a jump of 226 percent, sparking interest from investors. In addition, various Wall Street analysts weighed in positively on the technology and on IonQ, specifically. Last Monday, Morgan Stanley Joseph Moore increased his price target for IonQ to $37 from $14.90, saying, “We can’t identify a clear catalyst for this kind of equity appreciation in the space over that time, but we do see continued indications that investment in quantum should continue growing at a rapid pace.” Additionally, Google unveiled its new chip Willo, which also appeared to have had a bullish effect on quantum stocks. Overall, IONQ ranks 4th on our list of biggest gainers of last week. While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
