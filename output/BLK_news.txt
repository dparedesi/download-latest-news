Once again, it feels as if we’re tiptoeing toward an official war between the United States and Russia — as opposed to the proxy war that has endured for three and half years between Russia and NATO-backed Ukraine. Although President Trump has downplayed the “rare and urgent” meeting of top military commanders from around the world at Quantico, Virginia, on Tuesday, the event has generated intense speculation. The Pentagon says that secretary of War Hegseth merely wants to deliver a speech on the “warrior ethos” and make sure that military leaders are all walking in the same direction. The president describes the focus of the gathering in general terms: “We’re talking about what we’re doing, what they’re doing, and how we’re doing.” Still, to gather the highest-ranking members of the U.S. military in one location for a chat with the president and secretary of War leaves the impression that something of significant importance will be discussed. On Monday morning, ZeroHedge gathered data from several sites that analyze open-source intelligence to predict military engagements. Those sites were all tracking a large deployment of U.S. aerial refueling tankers crossing the Atlantic on their way to Europe. A social media account that tracks pizzerias near the Pentagon showed a spike in orders late Sunday night. The last time these sources noted a wave of air tankers leaving the United States and increased carryout orders from restaurants near the Pentagon, the U.S. military was preparing to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. When these open-source data points are viewed alongside the unusual meeting of top military commanders in northern Virginia, it is difficult not to conclude that a potentially significant military operation is imminent. Notably, there has been a shift in public messaging from high-ranking government officials. U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Fox News on Sunday that President Trump has authorized NATO to use U.S. missiles in direct strikes against Moscow. In a post on Truth Social one week ago, the president stated, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump’s rhetorical departure from months of effort directed toward peace came right after a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky at the United Nations in New York City. While answering reporters’ questions at the U.N., Trump said that allies should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter into the airspace of NATO nations. Marveling at the president, Zelensky called Trump a “game changer.” In a separate interview on Fox News, Vice President Vance said that the administration might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles. Noting that President Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to equip Ukraine with weapons that can strike Moscow, Vance’s assessment of the situation nonetheless suggested that U.S.-NATO is about to take a more aggressive posture in the region. While signs indicate greater U.S. involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict in the near future, the Russian foreign ministry has been highlighting uncorroborated online chatter claiming that the Ukrainian military intends to use captured Russian drones in staged “false flag” attacks on logistics hubs in Poland and Romania. There are no hard facts to back this assertion, but numerous media reports coming from Hungarian sources have repeated the claim in recent days. Should Poland or Romania be attacked, President Trump’s recent comments suggest that there would be a swift U.S.-NATO response. As is always the case in war, propaganda and misdirection make it almost impossible to analyze this information. Ukraine has an obvious motive to undertake an operation against its allies in an effort to drag U.S.-led NATO into a larger war. Over the last three years, the Ukrainian military appears to have been involved in several attacks on NATO interests — including the sabotage of Nord Stream pipelines supplying Russian energy to Germany and the more recent attack on pipeline networks supplying oil from Russia to Hungary and Slovakia — as part of an overall strategy to separate Russia from European Union economic partners. At the same time, it is entirely logical for Russia to flood the information space with allegations of a looming “false flag” attack while carrying out an actual attack of its own. If something were to occur in Poland, Romania, or Moldova in the next few days, both Russia and NATO will accuse the other of spreading disinformation. These competing “narratives” ensure that confusion will reign — ratcheting up the prospect of retaliatory attacks and perilous escalation. I do not like where this is heading. The issue of U.S.-NATO support for the Kyiv government in its fight against the Russian Federation has divided American conservatives. Some Americans view Russia with such hostility that they almost appear eager for a direct U.S.-Russia confrontation. I believe that such a conflict has the potential to kill millions of people and put us on the path toward long-term global instability. Those who rush to defend Ukraine’s territorial borders routinely ignore that the eastern territories in dispute belong mainly to Russian-speaking peoples who have repeatedly allied with the Russian Federation. When NATO and Kyiv deny people the natural right to determine their own future in the name of Ukraine’s national “self-determination,” I find the argument for war ludicrous. This has always been a civil war involving historically Russian areas, and bloodshed began only after Obama’s State Department and European Union emissaries decided to expand NATO’s territorial grip right up to Russia’s doorstep by sacrificing Ukraine in a proxy war. Of all the reasons that U.S. and European politicians provide for the necessity of defending Ukraine, the idea that Russia’s invasion was entirely “unprovoked” is most laughable. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Ukraine has directly attacked property belonging to NATO nations. Nonetheless, NATO appears ready to protect a country that has attacked its members and to attack a country that has not. This has always felt like another expedient “bankers’ war,” meant to put money into the hands of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions while stealing the lives and tax dollars of Western citizens. Over at The Conservative Treehouse, Sundance framed the issue aptly: The reason why the EU member states of NATO want escalated war with Russia is financial and economic. Through policy and ideology, the EU/NATO members have walked themselves into an economic dead end. They are out of assets to leverage. The only way out for the EU/NATO leadership is to create a war to erase debt, expand assets and reset the economics. While BlackRock, J.P. Morgan, and other World Economic Forum heavyweights divide up Ukraine’s assets and manage control over the Ukraine Recovery and Reinvestment Bank, international financial interests will turn wartime spending into a money machine. At the same time, all the self-inflicted economic damage caused by “green” energy regulations and central bank money-printing propping up the expansive European welfare state can be blamed on “Russian aggression.” Should the whole financial system near collapse, the perfect rationale will exist to implement central bank digital currencies and mandatory digital identities for Western citizens. Once again, governments will manufacture potentially catastrophic problems in order to justify “solutions” that nobody wanted in the first place. In this case, however, the problem that NATO governments are creating comes with the certain loss of numerous lives and the inherent risk of cataclysm. I don’t like this game, and I wish that wiser heads would succeed in preventing this violent calculus from reaching its ever deadlier conclusion. Right now, however, all signs point to madness. It looks as if a wider war with Russia will coincide with Antifa’s war against Americans at home. Prepare accordingly.

Title: Vercel grabs $300M in late-stage funding to fuel its AI pivot
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/30/vercel-grabs-300m-late-stage-funding-fuel-ai-pivot/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T01:25:08Z

UPDATED 21:25 EDT / SEPTEMBER 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Vercel Inc., the front-end development specialist that enables companies to build and deploy scalable websites quickly, said today it has raised $300 million in a late-stage round to accelerate its transition to focus on artificial intelligence. The company said its oversubscribed Series F funding round was led by Accel and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, with participation from new investors BlackRock, StepStone and Khosla Ventures, raising its valuation to $9.3 billion. As more enterprises come to rely on AI for critical workflows, demand for developer-friendly platforms like Vercel is increasing rapidly, founder and Chief Executive Guillermo Rauch said in a blog post announcing the investment. Silicon Valley-based Vercel made its name helping developers build websites and applications. It’s the creator of Next.js, a popular open-source framework that’s used to build front ends for websites and applications. The company commercializes Node.js through a cloud service that offloads processing tasks usually done in the user’s browser to website operators’ servers. That allows those tasks to be completed faster, which reduces web page loading times. Having established itself as a developer favorite, Vercel has in the last year shifted its focus towards AI development with the launch of its AI Cloud platform. Its main component is a software development kit known as the AI SDK, which provides streamlined access to more than 60 of the most powerful large language models from companies including OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Meta Platforms Inc., Cohere Inc. and others. The AI SDK has proven to be immensely popular, with more than 3 million downloads per week, making it the company’s fastest-growing open-source project, Rauch said. “Just like React brought accessibility to pages, the AI SDK is bringing accessibility to tokens to multiple sources of intelligence,” he added. The company also offers access to AI infrastructure and an open-source vibe coding platform called v0, which boasts more than 3.5 million users. Earlier this month, it debuted its very first AI agent, called Vercel Agent, in public beta. It’s primary task is to automate code reviews, scanning human- and AI-generated codebases, identifying problems and creating fixes for any problems it finds. Its fixes are validated in sandboxed environments to ensure they don’t cause any further strife. “Our bet on open source has become a powerful flywheel, and we’re excited to continue democratizing agents and making them accessible to everyone,” Rauch said. “We’ve evolved as much in this last year as we did in the first nine. Because there has to be a cloud that’s designed and purpose-built for AI applications. Vercel has built this from the ground up with the AI Cloud.” The AI Cloud has helped to ignite dramatic new growth for Vercel, doubling its user base over the last 12 months and increasing its revenue by 82%, off an undisclosed base. Rauch said its customers include some of the leading players in the AI industry, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as big-name enterprises like PayPal Holdings Inc., Nike Inc. and Walmart Inc. Rauch said Vercel will use the funds from today’s round to expand its AI cloud services and enhance the v0 development agent’s capabilities. It’s also set to launch a mobile version of v0 later this month, which will make it possible for developers to build applications using voice and camera inputs. Separately, Vercel is also planning a $300 million secondary tender offer for current and former employees and early investors, which is expected to close next month.

Title: Will institutions follow Bitcoin onto other chains?

Structural changes, such as the approval of altcoin ETFs, might change how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The success of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and major BTC treasury companies marked another step in the institutional adoption of crypto. US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $518 million on Sept. 29 and have accumulated $57.3 billion in net flows since their launch in January 2024, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) crossed $80 billion in assets by July 2025, becoming the fastest ETF to reach that threshold in just 374 trading days. Adding to the stellar performance, names such as Harvard Management Co. and the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala disclosed investments in Bitcoin through IBIT. The digital asset treasury movement expanded in tandem with the adoption of ETFs. Strategy increased its Bitcoin holdings to 649,031 BTC worth $72.67 billion as of Sept. 29. Meanwhile, Metaplanet up-sized its share offering to $1.4 billion in September to fund aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions, targeting 210,000 BTC by 2027. Institutions now face a choice between cold storage and yield generation. Max Gokhman, deputy CIO at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, noted that yield is a major driver for institutional adoption of crypto. And the SEC is clearing pathways for yield through regulated products. On Aug. 6, a staff statement confirmed that liquid staking tokens do not constitute securities by default, while the Sept. 17 generic listing standards expedited crypto ETF approvals. As more altcoin ETFs are set to launch in the US, potentially offering yields through staking, institutions will gain exposure to the returns that crypto has to offer. This change might impact how Wall Street sees Bitcoin. Bitcoin is scattered across 365,958.79 BTC in synthetic forms totaling $41.8 billion as of Sept. 30, according to Bitcoin Layers. As Bitcoin does not have native smart contract capabilities, the idea of a synthetic token, commonly referred to as a wrapper, is to allow the usage of BTC in DeFi protocols built on other blockchains. Babylon leads native staking with 58,271.77 BTC, generating a 0.29% APR through a self-custodial protocol that secures proof-of-stake chains. Using Babylon’s infrastructure, chains and applications can tap a security layer maintained by BTC staking. Lombard’s LBTC token transforms Bitcoin into a liquid staking asset with 0.82% APY and $1.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), compatible with Ethereum, Base, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Katana, Sonic, Starknet, and Sui through native Chainlink and canonical bridge integrations. Threshold operates tBTC v2 across Ethereum, Starknet, Sui, and MezoChain with 6,335.31 tBTC bridged and $717.7 million in TVL. Solv Protocol offers its solvBTC across 12 chains, including Arbitrum, Mantle, and the Bitcoin mainnet, with $1.7 billion in total value locked (TVL). Meanwhile, b14g offers an average of 5% APR through dual-staking mechanisms that combine BTC with native protocol tokens, across a $300 million TVL. Zeus Network bridges Bitcoin to Solana via the zBTC wrapper, with $58.7 million in TVL using Multi-Party Computation for trustless cross-chain interoperability. It offers 4.52% APY on staking via Fragmetric. Thorchain facilitates native Bitcoin swaps for assets across different chains with $74 million locked. Bitcoin bridges processed $1.87 million in September 2025. Regarding chains with the largest amounts of wrappers, Ethereum holds 178,458.67 BTC as of Sept. 30, followed by BNB Smart Chain at 24,082.67 BTC and Base at 21,647.85 BTC. Besides the wrapper domination in established blockchains, Lightning Network presents itself as a significant rail for BTC usage. Lightning maintains $438 million in TVL despite a 20% decline in public capacity from 5,400 BTC in late 2023 to 4,200 BTC by August 2025. Coinbase reported that 15% of Bitcoin withdrawals were routed through Lightning by mid-2025, and CoinGate documented that Lightning accounted for 16% of Bitcoin orders in 2024, compared to 6.5% two years prior. Additionally, Tether deployed USDT over Lightning via Taproot Assets in January 2025, enabling dollar-denominated payments without locking BTC in channels. Despite the plurality of networks and wrappers that institutions could use to add composability to Bitcoin if they wish to, the key point of access remains through ETFs. Using BlackRock’s IBIT S-1 filing as an example, the document specifies that Coinbase Custody Trust Company holds Bitcoin in segregated cold storage wallets with multi-signature authentication, separate from all other Coinbase assets. In January 2025, BlackRock filed an amendment to IBIT’s structure to allow in-kind creation and redemption, requiring Coinbase Custody to process withdrawals to public blockchain addresses within 12 hours. Currently, there is limited room to incorporate yield pathways into Bitcoin ETFs, which would involve exploring the DeFi ecosystem using BTC. Additionally, the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule mandates financial institutions and Virtual Asset Service Providers to transmit originator and beneficiary identifying information with virtual currency transactions. This standard requires end-to-end transparency to aid law enforcement and mitigate financial crime risks. ETF issuers must maintain segregated custody with regulated entities that are capable of producing audit trails that satisfy the travel rule requirements. Wrapped Bitcoin protocols introduce trust assumptions that conflict with institutional custody standards. Threshold’s tBTC relies on decentralized node operators to maintain the bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a multi-signature custodial model where no single entity controls funds. Although this is positive from a decentralization perspective, it introduces a security dependency on the integrity of the validator set. Lombard utilizes Babylon’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol, combined with a consortium model for custody, which distributes risk across multiple parties. Again, there is an effort to decentralize single points of failure; however, this adds coordination requirements that complicate audit procedures. A Bitcoin ETF holding LBTC on Base would face scrutiny on Optimism’s fraud-proof system, Base’s sequencer centralization, and the bridge’s oracle dependencies. Each wrapped BTC variant trades off security assumptions. BitGo’s wBTC utilizes centralized custody with legal agreements, whereas Threshold’s tBTC distributes custody across validators, who must maintain uptime and adhere to honest behavior. These layered risks multiply audit surfaces beyond what segregated cold storage presents. Babylon’s 0.29% APR on staked Bitcoin compares unfavourably to Ethereum’s 3.2% staking yield or Solana’s 7.1% APY available through liquid staking derivatives. Lombard’s 0.82% return requires institutions to accept exposure to 13 different blockchain networks, each with distinct security models and potential failure modes. These examples reveal the challenge that a 1% yield advantage on a 5% Bitcoin allocation contributes just five basis points to total portfolio returns. Institutions might find insufficient compensation for introducing bridge risk, oracle dependencies, and cross-chain settlement complexity. Franklin Templeton’s Gokhman observed that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a cyclical, high-beta risk asset that correlates with traditional financial markets as institutional adoption grows. This framing suggests that portfolio managers prefer to separate their Bitcoin holdings from yield generation, maintaining BTC as a pure exposure play while sourcing returns from assets with more established DeFi infrastructure. An institution could hold Bitcoin through IBIT’s segregated cold storage while deploying capital into Ethereum ETFs that will potentially offer staking yields through proven liquid staking tokens approved by the SEC’s August 2025 guidance. Dividing exposure requires allocating capital across multiple positions but preserves custody clarity and simplifies compliance reporting. The alternative of bridging Bitcoin to access DeFi yields forces institutions to evaluate whether Threshold’s node operators or Lombard’s decentralized consortium provides equivalent security to Coinbase Custody’s federally regulated cold storage. Each bridge introduces a new counterparty, and each destination chain adds another risk surface that chain risk committees must review. The fragmented liquidity across 365,958 BTC, spread across different protocols and chains, compounds this complexity, as no single venue offers the depth that institutions require for entry and exit without market impact. In conclusion, Bitcoin layer-2 and alternative layer protocols offer technical solutions for yield generation. However, it is up to regulators to find a way to accommodate these paths into regulated products, and it is up to institutions to decide whether direct exposure is worth the risk.

Title: Letters to the Editor, October 1st: On disenfranchised voters, Connolly and Germany and leprechauns

Time Published: 2025-10-01T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – The presidential election has highlighted to me a serious, archaic flaw in our electoral system. I’m a resident, registered voter, yet I’m legally prohibited from voting. On election day, I’ll be one of a group of 11 eligible voters touring in a music show across Germany. We join the tens of thousands of resident, registered voters abroad on election day who are disenfranchised. Millions more eligible citizens are disenfranchised because they live abroad. Even returning emigrants who arrive after October 24th have no say on who their next president will be. My touring colleagues and I are representing our nation, showcasing the best of Irish culture to thousands of people across Germany. Yet, in doing so, we are stripped of our right to vote. Germany is among the vast majority of democratic nations who have provisions for overseas voting, I wonder what their citizens would make of our disenfranchisement? This all leads to the question, how democratic are our elections when millions of eligible voters cannot exercise their legal right to vote? – Yours, etc, DAVE FLYNN, Composer and musician, 77 Camden Street Lower, Dublin 2. Connolly and Germany Sir, – We are lucky to have intellectuals with “largesse d’esprit” to correct pre-conceived stereotypes of other nationalities and remind us of important facts. Having lived in Germany for 12 years, I was shocked to hear a potential president of Ireland referring to the increase in military spending in Germany as having 1930s fascist overtones. I also find the insular attitude of some people alluding to “Europe” as something apart from Ireland antediluvian. Thank you, Fintan. – Yours, etc, MUIREANN NÍ CHINNÉIDE, Dún Laoghaire, Dublin. Sir, – I read Fintan O, Toole’s article with interest (“Catherine Connolly should keep her inner Basil Fawlty under wraps”, September 30th). He fails to take into account they are human beings with human foibles. Yes, she did make a gaffe, but was it necessary to write a full article on an obvious error? I look forward to reading his articles on Heather Humphreys and Jim Gavin pointing out their shortcomings. – Yours, etc, SIOBHÁN FITZGERALD, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir, – Fintan O’Toole questions the language that Catherine Connolly uses to highlight the large increase in Germany’s defence spending and whether it is appropriate of her to do so given Germany’s support for Ireland during the Brexit crisis and the threat of a hard border. A bigger issue than this and what we really don’t see enough discussion of is the volume of German arms exports, especially to Israel. According to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Germany has been supplying 30 per cent of all Israeli arms imports, making them the second largest supplier behind the US. Additionally, the BBC has reported that German arms sales to Israel has increased ten-fold since 2022. Despite very recently halting the sales of arms to Israel due to pressure, Germany has not only been enabling Israel to commit genocide in Gaza, but also profiting from it. While Germany is a friend of Ireland within the EU, Catherine Connolly is right to call out Germany’s build up of their arms industry and how they are arming parties involved in conflicts, in particular Israel. – Yours, etc, CIARÁN HARRON, Shankill, Dublin. Presidential debate Sir, – The office of Ireland’s president is intended to be non-political. However, at some campaign events, and at Monday night’s debate, candidates were confronted with political policy questions. A candidate is likely to have a personal opinion about such issues, but if elected president they cannot state such views publicly. As president, the person can only offer such statements that coincide with the positions of the government. Reporters should keep this in mind rather than perhaps seeking to catch out a candidate in an awkward position. –Yours, etc. DAN DONOVAN, Dungarvan, Co Waterford. Sir, – Having watched most of last night’s presidency debate on Virgin One a number of thoughts came to mind. Regular political journalists seem to treat it as just another general election and the questions do not seem to relate very much to the office they are seeking. Somebody who understands the role might make a better chair, maybe an historian like Diarmaid Ferriter. A summary of what President Michael D Higgins did over the last 14 years could also help voters understand the role and the candidates could then outline their approach and vision. Discussing how a county council hasn’t built a council house in decades is important, but is for a different forum, I think. I am hoping to enjoy the rest of the debates but would love to be a bit more engaged by the chairs and the candidates. – Yours, etc, PARAIC CORBETT, Shankill, Dublin 18. A Ryder Cup suggestion Sir, – The behaviour of a significant and vocal minority of spectators at the Ryder Cup in Bethpage was very disappointing and unbecoming of a professional golf event. While some have drawn comparisons to scenes at football matches, I believe this analogy is misplaced. In a soccer match, it’s highly likely such disruptive individuals would have been removed from the stadium and banned from future matches. With the 2027 Ryder Cup in Adare Manor already well into its planning stages, now is the time for organisers to implement a formal code of conduct, making adherence to these guidelines a condition of ticket purchase. To start, those responsible for the worst behaviour at Bethpage Golf Club should be advised not to attend. Further measures should include limiting alcohol sales, ensuring that only sober attendees are admitted, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy towards substance abuse. A dress code should be enforced, with a focus on traditional golf attire and a strict prohibition on any form of nationalist clothing. Additionally, introducing family friendly and alcohol-free areas could provide a welcome refuge for spectators who prefer a quieter, more respectful viewing experience. These areas could offer preferential viewing spots for those with moderate habits, creating a more balanced atmosphere and encouraging positive behaviour. The Ryder Cup has a great history, and it is imperative that contemporary spectators uphold the dignity and integrity of the event. – Yours, etc, DAVID CASSIDY, Dublin 9. Sir, – Surely the US players should have been more proactive in trying to stop the more outrageous behaviour of US “fans?” Sportsmanship? – Yours, etc, TONY WALL, Raheny, Dublin. Neutrality and aggression Sir, – The excellent letters by Brian Girvin and Donal McGrath (Lettters, September 29th) clearly set out Ireland’s vulnerability to any aggressive nation. As in the second World War, countries discovered neutrality was absolutely no defence against an aggressor. At present, various European countries are experiencing “unexplained” incursions by drones and fighter jets. Against this background it is vital that Ireland commits more funds to defending our territorial air space and seas. This does not mean more tanks and guns, but it does mean more high technology tracking and weapon systems and fully trained operators. Sufficient funds must also be committed to ensure all our naval vessels have trained crews and the best equipment. I appreciate housing and health are at the top of the Government’s budget, but the time has come to stop hiding behind neutrality and to take responsibility for our national security. – Yours, etc, MIKE CORMACK, Blackrock, Co Dublin. Penalising poor customer service Sir, – Yet again Pricewatch is on the trail of poor customer service provided by big telecom and airline companies. They always give so-called apologies in the so-called rare events of not meeting their usual so-called standard of care. Perhaps for a start we should be provided with a mandatory phone number for contacting these companies, with the apology made all the more real by having a premium of a euro for each minute over their target time of five minutes payable to their “valued” customers who are kept hanging on for ages waiting for a reply. After all our time is valuable also. – Yours, etc JOHN ROGERS, Rathowen, Co Westmeath. Car-free days Sir, – Your correspondent John Bergin (Letters, September 29th) makes a good point about car-free days and those of us who do not live in Dublin city centre. I have a routine commitment that requires me to be in Ballsbridge every Sunday at 10am. I can just about get there by public transport if I leave my house no later than 7.45am. The first train of the day will get me from Kildare to Dublin Heuston, after which I need to change twice – first to the Luas, then to the Dart – with a combined wait time of almost 40 minutes and a fare of ¤7.50. Alternatively, I can have an extra 90 minutes in bed, leaving my house at 9.15am in the car – for about half the cost. –Yours, etc, RICHARD BANNISTER, Kildare. Bus timetable changes Sir, – I agree completely with Robbie Wells (Letters, September 29th) on bus routes and numbers being changed without adequate notification. It was by chance I stumbled on this online. There was no notice to commuters, no regard for senior or neurodivergent travellers . No one in this community (Firhouse) was aware of it, when I pointed it out . Schoolchildren will be affected, second and third level. Senior citizens too. It seems high-handed , and disrespectful in the extreme. – Yours, etc, MARY McDAID, Dublin. Thinking outside Dublin Sir, – Eugene O’Malley’s proposal for alleviating the housing crisis by building a new town/city 30 miles west of Dublin (Letters, September 29th) is an excellent one. Beginning as a dormitory town for Dublin with a good rail service, this would develop independently with its own infrastructure. Apart from the many practical and political advantages O’Malley mentions, I would add that such a town, from the start, could take account of Ireland’s desperate need of biodiversity. Ebenezer Howard set out the principles for designing Garden Cities in 1898 in which gardens, allotments and surrounding fields would offer not only healthy, biodiverse green spaces, but the ability to grow much of the city’s own food. Many garden cities and suburbs have since been completed since. Such a town, west of Dublin as suggested, should be properly planned and financed and begun as soon as possible. – Yours, etc, TRICIA CUSACK, Co Wicklow. Sir, – Eugene O’Malley proposes a new dormitory town 30 miles from Dublin to relieve housing pressure there (Letters, September 30th). This to me seems but a continuation of the skewed development policy in Ireland towards the east coast. A more balanced plan would see the west being developed, more particularly the Limerick-Galway corridor which already has rail lines and other infrastructure and above all would hopefully dispense with the need for the ruinous Shannon to Dublin pipeline. This year again we have had algal blooms on Lough Derg which according to studies is a result of warmer weather and lower water levels. Do we really need to lower them further? – Yours, etc, ENDA SCANLON, Ennis, Co Clare. Don’t look up Sir, –Environmental headlines almost seem engineered not to pique the average reader’s interest. Last Friday (September 26th), I noticed two articles squashed into the right hand column, one by Caroline O’Doherty highlighting a mass fish kill on the river Blackwater, another by Kevin O’Sullivan titled “Algal Bloom on Lough Derg prompts call for investigation,” both concluding that we aren’t quite sure what happened, but investigations are under way. Human actions are what happened and we don’t need to read about the minutia of inconclusive forensic investigations to understand. What we do need is an active media that actually reports on the climate crisis and stimulates national concern. The following three or four pages detailed sporting achievements – hardly a more pressing subject matter. I urge editors to dedicate more resources and space to the real issues facing humanity. I am reminded too often when reading the newspaper of the 2021 Adam McKay film Don’t Look Up which accurately depicted humanities hypothetical apathy toward an apocalyptic comet heading for earth. – Yours, etc, THEO DILLON, Co Cork. Cross words Sir, – Morning completion of the Boston Globe mini-crossword has become the new normal in my household. You can imagine the consternation that ensued from this particular clue yesterday: “like leprechauns” with the solution being “Irish”. Thankfully, breakfast had been consumed as otherwise I would probably have choked on my muesli with no added sugar. Your Simplex at lunchtime continues apace with no such bombshells. – Yours, etc, FRANK J BYRNE, Dublin 9. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: IBIT flips to in-kind creations: what it means for spreads, taxes and flows

Tighter spreads, tax advantages, and smoother arbitrage: that’s the payoff as IBIT adopts in-kind creations and redemptions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The largest Bitcoin ETF in the world has just revamped its process for moving coins in and out of the fund. BlackRock’s IBIT, which has accrued more than $20 billion since launch, can now process creations and redemptions “in kind.” The SEC’s approval order quietly flipped the switch: IBIT’s authorized participants can now swap Bitcoin directly against shares instead of only taking or delivering cash. While it might sound like a small operating change, the effects could be anything but minor. When spot ETFs went live in January 2024, the SEC required them to be created in cash. If you wanted to buy IBIT, an authorized participant (AP) like Citadel or UBS would sell you ETF shares and wire cash to Coinbase to source the actual Bitcoin. Redemptions worked the same way in reverse: sell ETF shares, get dollars back, and Coinbase liquidated coins to cover the difference. However, this model created a drag. Every creation and redemption process runs through a fiat leg, accumulating transaction costs, custody fees, and, most importantly, tax frictions. APs couldn’t simply shift Bitcoin in inventory: they had to finalize cash sales. That widened bid-ask spreads for large players and opened the door to tracking errors between IBIT’s share price and Bitcoin. In-kind solves this. Now, if an AP needs to deliver 1,000 BTC worth of IBIT shares, it can simply transfer 1,000 BTC from its own balance. Redeeming works the same way: return IBIT shares, receive coins directly, and no forced liquidation. Not everyone can do this. The SEC’s approval order and updated IBIT prospectus name four firms with the privilege: Jane Street, Virtu Americas, JP Morgan Securities, and Marex. These are the desks that already dominate ETF market-making. They now get to skip a step, moving Bitcoin in and out of IBIT’s custodian wallet without having to go through dollars first. That means tighter inventory management, faster arbitrage, and less basis risk. This also means that the spreads on IBIT should compress further. ETFs already trade at pennies around NAV, but with direct coin settlement, the incentive to quote even tighter grows. Then there’s the tax angle. Cash redemptions can trigger taxable events when APs dump Bitcoin to fund withdrawals. In-kind transfers are generally tax-neutral. For institutions managing balance sheets, that’s a meaningful edge. Some ETF lawyers argue it could also sidestep wash-sale complications, since redemptions now involve moving the asset itself rather than cycling cash. The SEC’s order doesn’t settle every nuance, but it makes IBIT look more like a gold ETF: shares backed by a stash of the commodity, with the ability to pull metal (or in this case, coins) on demand. IBIT already dominates the field, regularly pulling in more net flows than all rivals combined. CryptoSlate’s coverage of Farside data shows that IBIT consistently banks hundreds of millions, if not billions, in net inflows, even when its competitors experience losses. By lowering friction for APs, BlackRock may have just sharpened that lead. Cheaper creations mean market makers can quote tighter spreads, attracting more secondary-market volume. Cleaner redemptions mean lower exit costs, which matters to institutions worried about getting stuck in size. Both point toward IBIT becoming the default liquidity pool, with rivals forced to follow if and when they get in-kind approval. Despite the magnitude of the change, everything will likely remain the same to retail investors. IBIT trades the same, with the same ticker and fees. However, under the hood, the switch matters. Tighter spreads should shave basis points off every trade. Better tax treatment reduces hidden costs for large players, and if APs move inventory more quickly, IBIT’s tracking error to Bitcoin could shrink further, improving its pitch as a one-for-one proxy. The broader market effect? Expect more flows into IBIT relative to competitors, at least until they win the same privilege. And regarding Bitcoin’s liquidity, moving coins in and out of the custodian without fiat detours could boost turnover at scale, with knock-on effects for derivatives markets that hedge against ETF inventory. One way or another, BlackRock got the ETF it wanted from day one: a true in-kind Bitcoin fund.

Bitcoin and Ethereum fuel broader market rebound as sentiment gradually shifts. Bitcoin and Ethereum pumped by more than 2% on the day following massive institutional and whale purchases. The broader crypto market reflected the bounce, rising by a percent. Its sustainability depends on continued capital inflow into the digital assets. The last 24 hours have seen the whole of the crypto market bounce by 1%, with Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] leading. The pair surged by over 2%, regaining previously lost key price levels. With only a day left until the last quarter of the year begins, sentiment is starting to shift. Whales and institutions have set the tone after almost two weeks of market correction across most of the coins. The shift in sentiment in the last 24 hours has resulted from several factors. SEC chair, Paul Atkins, affirmed his stance on making crypto his number one priority to fuel innovation in the United States. This induced confidence among crypto enthusiasts at a time the market was struggling. Institutions and whales were also loading up more BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Spot ETFs saw $518M in inflows, which is 4.6K BTC. ETH broke its 5-day ETF outflow streak as it received $546M in capital injection. Fidelity bought $299 million worth of BTC and $202 million worth of ETH, as per Whale Insider. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) added over $20M BTC, taking the firm’s holdings to slightly more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Source: Arkham/ BlackRock (IBIT) also purchased $154M in BTC. On top of that, IBIT dethroned Deribit as the largest BTC options venue, with its Open Interest (OI) at $38 billion against $32 billion. For Ethereum, whales were closing short positions as they reverted to accumulation. The market rebounded, resulting in over $1.58M in losses for one whale, as per Lookonchain data. On buying, a new wallet by BitMine added $107M ETH. A whale also added $21M in ETH from the OKX exchange. On the charts, Bitcoin rose above $110,000, with the price reaching $114,000 at the time of writing. However, the BTC was seeing some rejection, with Crypto Tony predicting a pullback to $113,000. Looking ahead, price needed to break above $115K for a continued surge. If prices fail to stay above $110K, they could retest lower levels. Source: CryptoTony/X Ethereum also reclaimed the key support level at $4,000 that had been lost. Price briefly dipped below this mark and was now targeting the resistance at $4,250, which would allow for further upside. If the altcoin failed to stay above $4,250, the drop could be repeated.

Title: Stripe and Brex make stablecoin moves

Payments giant Stripe and corporate spend management player Brex have unveiled products that bring stablecoins closer to the mainstream. 2 Likes 2 30 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Stripe has unveiled Open Issuance, a platform that lets businesses launch and manage their own stablecoins with just a few lines of code. The company notes that businesses are adopting stablecoins quickly, with total supply growing 57% in the last 12 months. But by building on coins issued by external providers, they’re unable to reap all the potential benefits. For example, a neobank that sits on large stablecoin dollar deposits doesn’t retain the yield itself. When its customers want to redeem their stablecoins for cash, they’re subject to burn fees. Open Issuance - powered by Bridge, the stablecoin platform Stripe recently acquired - is designed to make it easy for firms to mint and burn coins freely, and customize their reserves to manage the ratio between cash and treasuries and choose their preferred partners. Treasuries are managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Superstate. Cash is held by Lead Bank to provide liquidity as necessary. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin,” says Zach Abrams, CEO, Bridge. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Separately, Brex will soon let customers with a business account accept stablecoins with automatic conversion into USD in their accounts and send stablecoins directly from their USD balances. In addition, customers will be able to pay their card balances with stablecoins. “Stablecoins make it possible to move millions of dollars across borders in seconds, but using them typically requires fragmented workflows and managing multiple platforms,” says Pedro Franceschi, CEO, Brex. “With today’s launch, forward-looking companies across industries, from AI to crypto, will manage their largest payments and mission-critical expenses on Brex, in a single, secure platform.”

Josh Pack, the co-chief executive and managing partner of Fortress Investment Group, died unexpectedly at 51. Forbes examined Vanguard’s recent push into actively-managed bond funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. September 30, 2025 Fortress co-chief executive dies, aged 51 “The company, which is majority-owned by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala investment arm and counts high-profile European chains such as Curzon Cinemas and Majestic Wine among its portfolio, announced his death in a statement on Monday night. No cause of death was given.” (Financial Times) Why Index Fund Giant Vanguard Is Pushing Actively Managed Bond Funds “And while Vanguard may not be thought of as a hub for Wall Street bond whizzes like Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Capital or PIMCO, its performance has been hard to match. According to Vanguard, 44 of its 48 active bond funds with a 10-year history outperformed their peer group averages.”(Forbes) SEC Directs ETF Share Class Applicants to Follow Dimensional’s Lead “In a Monday afternoon call with more than 100 representatives from asset managers representing most of the other applicants, SEC staff said firms will be expected to update their filings to look ‘substantially the same as’ Dimensional’s updated version, submitted last Friday, according to Kevin Gustafson, partner at K&L Gates, who was privy to the call. That directive affects the nearly 80 fund firms that have filed requests to use the multi-class structure since Vanguard’s patent expired in 2023.” (ETF.com) 4 Ways Your Clients’ Biases Are Costing Them Money “The technical side of tax-efficient investing is a known quantity, but the human side is far more complex. The most successful advisors understand that their biggest job is not to be a financial whiz, but to be a behavioral coach.” (Morningstar) Prosecutors Urge Court to Reject Ken Leech Calls for Cherry Picking Examples “Prosecutors this week hit back against demands for specific examples in its fraud case against Western Asset Management's former co-chief investment officer, arguing that the defense's objections misrepresent the government's strategy.” (FundFire) Public/Private Fund Liquidity: What You Need to Know “When new money stops coming in, managers may restrict or suspend withdrawals to avoid selling assets at inopportune times. This move, though, often erodes investor trust and signals serious trouble for the fund.” (Morningstar) Why “Downside Protection” ETFs Don’t Protect Portfolios As Well As A Stock-Bond Mix (In The Long Term) “Ultimately, downside protection ETFs can serve a niche purpose, such as holding short-term funds earmarked for near-term goals where principal protection is critical and the investor is comfortable sacrificing upside. But they are not a true substitute for equity exposure, and their complexity can mask the relatively modest benefits they offer compared to more traditional fixed income strategies.” (Kitces.com) The ETF Boom: Quality over Quantity “Should the market be concerned about this rapid pace of issuance or the sheer number of ETFs? Looking beneath the surface, the number of ETFs doesn’t tell the whole story. Most new ETFs have AUM: for those launched since 2024, the average AUM is about $230 million, but the median is only $25 million. In fact, roughly 875 have less than $50 million in AUM, underscoring that many launches fail to attract significant assets.” (JP Morgan Asset Management) BlackRock PE co-head: Semi-liquids could facilitate model portfolio adoption “Semi-liquid fund structures allow private market exposures to link into model portfolios more easily, according to Jonathan Seeg, global co-head of BlackRock Private Equity Partners.” (Private Equity International) Nuveen Aims To Raise $3B For Private Farmland REIT “The firm said that new farming technology, the expected growth in global demand for food and scarcity of undeveloped farmland will boost land values, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.” (Bisnow) CAIS adds 17 private markets firms to its advisor menu “The CAIS Marketplace menu expansion includes strategies from Ares Management, AQR, BlackRock, Blue Owl, Coller, Eldridge, Fortress Investment Group, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Golub Capital, Kayne Anderson, Kennedy Lewis, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Eaton Vance, Nuveen, Veritas, Vista Equity Partners and others, officials announced this week. In total, roughly 70 firms are now participating on the CAIS platform that offers over 150 funds.” (Alternatives Watch) Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes David Bodamer Editorial Director, WealthManagement.com David Bodamer covers investments for WealthManagement.com, including hosting the Wealth Management Invest podcast.

Federal Reserve Jared Dillian | 9.30.2025 12:15 PM Council of Economics Chair Stephen Miran was confirmed as a Federal Reserve governor just before September's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The impact was immediate—and troubling. Miran dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, and he put a dot on the dot plot—the Fed's survey of members' interest rate expectations—that was 150 basis points lower by the end of the year. Miran wants to lower the federal funds interest rates by 200 basis points immediately, which is well outside the consensus at the Fed. Miran wants huge interest rate cuts at a time when the stock market, cryptocurrency, and gold are at all-time highs, credit spreads are at all-time lows, the unemployment rate is only 4.3 percent, and gross domestic product just came in at 3.8 percent. His logic is that the labor market is weakening—it is, slightly—and he wants to cut interest rates to forestall a recession. But with financial conditions so easy, and inflation hovering around three percent—above the Fed's two percent target—an interest rate cut at this juncture makes no economic sense and risks stoking significant inflation. Miran has made statements in favor of Fed independence in the past, yet his actions now undercut that principle. President Donald Trump has explicitly called for interest rates to be lowered to 0.5 percent, he has installed his man at the Fed, and his man is doing his bidding. This is highly unusual. In the past, it has been political conservatives who have been hard money advocates, consistently pushing for higher interest rates and for fighting inflation. Now the liberals are the inflation fighters and the conservatives believe that a politically active Federal Reserve has been blocking the White House's agenda. One possible reason for Trump and Miran's intransigence on lower rates could be that they are trying to lower the cost of funding the U.S. government. T-bill issuance has been at an all-time high, first under former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and then under Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. By lowering short-term interest rates, the Fed would effectively be lowering the amount of interest that the government would pay on its debt. But this is not the purpose of the Federal Reserve. The Fed is supposed to set interest rates and the money supply to equilibrate inflation and unemployment—its two mandates. Lowering the cost of funding the government is not part of the Fed's mandate. Bessent, for his part, is waiting for long-term interest rates to drop to term out the debt and lock in lower interest rates at longer maturities. This is a dangerous game, as the Fed's actions could actually cause long-term interest rates to rise. Trump now has one loyalist on the Board of Governors, and he will soon have more. It seems likely that Lisa Cook will be replaced, and Jerome Powell will depart as chairman in 2026 (although Powell will have the option to stay on the board). It's not hard to envision a group of Trump's Fed officials acting as a voting bloc, lowering interest rates to near zero and keeping them there even as inflationary pressures build. This is the monetary policy of Turkish President Recep Tayyib Erdogan. It has not worked out well in Turkey, where inflation has skyrocketed and the value of its currency has plummeted. This is the reason that central banks are supposed to be remote from political pressures. Politicians always prefer that the economy run hot to keep people employed. But a "fast" economy is not necessarily a "good" economy. During Alan Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, the Fed prioritized vigilance on inflation. By contrast, the 2010s Fed focused on countering post-crisis deflation, showing far less concern about rising prices. The Powell Fed had to fight inflation in 2021–2022, and it did so incompetently. Absent Trump, the Fed would not have cut interest rates two weeks ago, and it would not be considering future interest rate cuts. Inflation is still high, and the economy can tolerate higher interest rates just fine—there is no compelling reason to lower them. Meanwhile, the search continues for a new Fed chair, and other candidates are being considered, including former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, who probably understands the bond market better than anyone but is clearly politicking for the job by advocating a 50 basis point cut at the last meeting. Low interest rates may be good for borrowers, but they are terrible for savers. There are trillions in money market mutual funds earning about four percent. If those yields disappear, people will be pushed into buying things like high-yield bonds or stocks, perhaps at the worst possible time. This would be an unprecedented experiment: slashing rates while the economy is already running hot. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Vanguard Weighs Allowing Trading of Crypto ETFs

The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies. September 30, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group Inc. is weighing whether to allow trading of cryptocurrency-focused exchange-traded funds on its platform, a move that would mark a major easing of its restrictive stance toward the popular but volatile asset class. Should the switch go through, it would open the door for Vanguard’s more than 50 million investors — with some $11 trillion in assets — to gain easier entry to digital assets. Vanguard itself doesn’t manage any crypto ETFS, and clients of the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based investment giant currently can’t trade other firms’ Bitcoin and Ether ETFs on its site. “We continuously evaluate our brokerage offer, investor preferences, and the evolving regulatory environment,” a Vanguard spokesperson said. “If and when a decision is made, clients will hear directly from Vanguard.” The asset manager has for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, saying that Bitcoin isn’t appropriate for long-term investors and that the asset class overall is “immature.” Its addition to portfolios could wreak “havoc,” its strategists have said. Former Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley said Vanguard would never launch a Bitcoin fund, and its famous founder Jack Bogle once advised investors to avoid the digital coin “like the plague.” Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes But to industry watchers, the assumption of Salim Ramji, a veteran of BlackRock Inc. who succeeded Buckley to became Vanguard’s CEO last year, was a key development. Unlike his predecessor, Ramji — the first outsider ever to lead Vanguard — has expressed interest in blockchain technology and Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 took the industry by storm, with fund inflows shattering records. Ether joined the party a few months later, when regulators approved the first spot ETFs tied to the second-largest cryptocurrency. Collectively, Bitcoin ETFs now manage more than $142 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT commanding roughly $84 billion. Some $24 billion of that amount has come in this year alone, which places the fund in the top-five accumulators of flows among all US ETFs.

Meanwhile, the White House, under President Donald Trump, has orchestrated a crypto push and hedge funds, pensions and banks have lavished capital into these and similar types of products.

Title: SEC To Allow TradFi Stocks to Trade Onchain

Time Published: 2025-09-30T16:04:42Z
Full Content:
Written byLandon Manning Edited byMohammad Shahid The SEC reportedly plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain by means of RWA tokenization. This would enable retail investors to bypass several key restrictions and use a Web3-native stock trading experience. Although it’s unclear when the rollout will happen or how ambitious it will be, the Commission is reportedly making this a priority. We could see a permanent transformation to TradFi markets in the next few days. The SEC has had a lot on its plate since beginning its newest pro-crypto initiatives, working on new ETF listing standards and regulatory innovation exemptions, among many other concerns. However, a new report details a particularly ambitious goal, as the Commission plans to allow TradFi stocks to trade onchain: BREAKING: The SEC is reportedly moving to allow stocks to trade like crypto, where stocks would trade on-chain.Under the plan, investors could buy tokens on crypto exchanges that represent shares of companies like Tesla or Nvidia. This news comes via a recent report, and it could have bombshell implications. The SEC’s proposed mechanism for bringing stocks onchain is fairly simple: it would offer tokenized RWAs. This would allow retail traders to purchase tokens whose value is directly linked to TradFi stocks like Tesla, Nvidia, or any of the other “Magnificent 7” tech firms. In other words, crypto investors would gain several distinct advantages. They could move their assets around 24/7/365, independently of TradFi’s market hours. This would also allow users to bypass regular brokerage institutions on the stock market, conducting business solely on Web3-native exchanges. BlackRock has been exploring RWA tokenization to bring TradFi stocks onchain, but its experiments were localized to ETFs. The SEC, by contrast, would open these services to a much wider range of products. It’s currently unclear if the Commission plans to launch a pilot program with a few stocks, or a laissez-fair approach where exchanges could list whatever assets they please. In any event, it plans to effectuate a concrete rollout “quickly.” The SEC is under political pressure to adopt a lot of different pro-crypto measures, but this onchain stock program seems like a particular priority. After all, the Trump administration is interested in TradFi/Web3 integration, putting economic data on the blockchain last month. Hopefully, the SEC will release an official announcement with more in-depth explanations soon. Putting Magnificent 7 stocks onchain would already be a huge market opportunity, but a total free-for-all could transform TradFi markets forever.

Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid's USDH and MetaMask's mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. "If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don't build on top of someone else's coin," Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. "With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them." Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. "With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy," Will Gaybrick, Stripe's president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on "pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream."

Title: Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says electricians and plumbers will be needed by the hundreds of thousands in the new working world
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-demand-for-gen-z-skilled-trade-workers-electricans-plumbers-carpenters-data-center-growth-six-figure-salaries/

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Gen Z keeps being told their chances of landing a job are slim as AI threatens entry-level jobs. But in reality, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang says, there are thousands of jobs for young people, thanks to an accelerating boom in data centers. They just have to be willing to go to trade school. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’ve going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” And Huang is not just talking about the need—he’s backing it up with cash. The chipmaker announced last week that it was investing $100 billion into OpenAI to help fund the development of data centers based on Nvidia’s AI processors. Industrywide, global capital spending on data centers is projected to hit $7 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey. A single 250,000-square-foot data center can employ up to 1,500 construction workers during its build-out—many earning more than $100,000, plus overtime—all without requiring a college degree. Once complete, about 50 full-time workers maintain the facility. But each of those jobs spurs another 3.5 in the surrounding economy. Huang’s call for more electricians and plumbers aligns with his broader view that the next wave of opportunity lies in the physical side of technology rather than the software. When asked earlier this year what he would study if he were 20 again, Huang admitted he’d lean toward disciplines rooted in the physical sciences. “For the young, 20-year-old Jensen, that’s graduated now, he probably would have chosen…more of the physical sciences than the software sciences,” he said. Fortune reached out to Huang for further comment. Huang isn’t the only CEO sounding the alarm about a looming shortage of skilled trades. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he raised concerns with the White House—arguing that deportations of immigrant labor, combined with a lack of interest among young Americans, are creating a perfect storm for data center construction. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said at an energy conference in March. “We just don’t have enough.” Just this week, Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed those concerns, pointing to the gap between Washington’s reshoring ambitions and the workforce to make it a reality. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?” The U.S. is already short 600,000 factory workers and 500,000 construction workers, according to a June LinkedIn post from Farley. And while the U.S. Department of Education has made the expansion of skilled trades programs a priority, some Gen Zers are already catching on. Take Jacob Palmer, a 23-year-old from North Carolina. After graduating from high school, he decided college was not the right fit. Instead, he joined an apprenticeship program at a contracting firm and trained as an electrician. By 21, he launched his own business—and last year grossed nearly $90,000. This year alone, he’s already hit six figures. Unlike many of his peers facing student debt and uncertain job prospects, he said simply: “I don’t owe anybody anything.” Have you made a successful career out of skilled trades?

Title: Solstice Finance Launches USX, Solana-Native Stablecoin With $160M TVL

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Solstice Finance, an on-chain asset management protocol backed by $1 billion investment firm Deus X Capital, has officially launched USX, its Solana-native stablecoin, alongside the YieldVault Program. The launch marks a significant step for the Solana ecosystem, bringing a purpose-built stablecoin designed for native yields, transparency, and seamless composability. At launch, over $160 million in total value locked (TVL) has been deposited into the protocol. The initiative has secured backing from leading institutions, including Galaxy Digital, MEV Capital, Bitcoin Suisse, Auros, and Deus X Capital. Stablecoins have become a cornerstone of DeFi; however, most of the dominant assets in the sector were not initially designed for the Solana ecosystem. According to Solstice Finance CEO and Co-Founder Ben Nadareski, this has resulted in liquidity flowing out of Solana to other ecosystems in search of stronger yields. Commenting on the development, Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice, stated: “Legacy stablecoins maintain majority market share, yet not a single leading stablecoin was born natively on Solana, and no dominant yield-native stablecoins currently exist in the ecosystem. We see stables often being bridged to other chains for best-in-class yield – that’s stable TVL leaving our ecosystem to try and earn elsewhere. We built USX, addressing this market gap on day one, a stablecoin that maintains all of the frictionless transaction benefits while giving access to institutional-grade yields that are native to the protocol.” Lily Liu, the President of the Solana Foundation, noted that the launch of Solstice opens new doors for developers, investors, and everyday users within the ecosystem. She emphasized that by bringing sustainable, real yield on-chain, Solstice is helping to reinforce Solana’s standing as a premier destination for defi. Several key components anchor Solstice Finance’s ecosystem. At its core is USX, a synthetic stablecoin that is fully backed with a 1:1 collateral ratio and secured through real-time Proof of Reserves provided by Chainlink. Complementing this is the YieldVault, the protocol’s flagship yield engine, which leverages delta-neutral trading strategies to deliver steady returns. In 2024, the vault achieved an annual performance of 21.5% and has maintained a flawless track record with no monthly losses since its inception. Looking ahead, Solstice plans to introduce SLX, its native utility token, designed under a community-first model that deliberately avoids venture capital allocations to prioritize long-term alignment with its users. Behind these innovations stands an expert team of more than 30 contributors with backgrounds from leading organizations, including Solana Labs, Coinbase, Galaxy Digital, BlackRock, Deloitte, and UBS, bringing deep experience from both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. Holders of USX can deposit into YieldVault and receive eUSX, representing their share of the protocol’s net asset value. This setup enables both retail and institutional participants, from $5 wallets to $50 million funds, to access transparent, delta-neutral yield strategies in a permissionless environment. Currently, Solstice is collaborating with over 30 ecosystem partners to drive integrations that further expand Solana’s DeFi opportunities. Solstice Finance is a decentralized finance protocol developed by Solstice Labs AG, a Deus X Enterprise company, in partnership with the Solstice Foundation. The protocol combines licensed fund management with innovative DeFi tools, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. Its core offerings include USX, the Solana-native stablecoin, and YieldVault, a yield-bearing protocol designed for institutional-grade returns. Beyond DeFi, Solstice Staking AG, an affiliated infrastructure provider, secures over $1 billion in assets across more than 9,000 validator nodes, making it one of the most trusted operators in the staking industry.

Title: BlackRock’s Canada Bitcoin ETF opens securities lending: More yield, new risks?

iShares Bitcoin ETF’s new lending initiative seeks to balance risk and reward through stringent safeguards and collateral requirements. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has confirmed that its Canadian arm has granted securities lending for the iShares Bitcoin ETF from Aug. 25 after providing investors with the required 60-day notice. The move follows disclosure in the June 26 prospectus, which outlined how the fund may engage in lending transactions in accordance with Canadian securities laws. The decision aligns it with other iShares ETFs in Canada, many of which already rely on securities lending to generate incremental income. Securities lending allows a fund to loan its holdings, such as shares or other securities, to borrowers, typically financial institutions, in exchange for collateral and a lending fee. Borrowers often use these securities to cover settlement gaps, meet collateral requirements, or support short-selling strategies. By opening IBIT to securities lending, BlackRock is effectively broadening the ETF’s revenue sources while emphasizing that protections will be in place to mitigate risk. BlackRock launched its Bitcoin product in the Canadian market in January. The fund allows investors to hold exposure to the flagship digital asset in Canadian and US dollars. It manages around CAD $358.9 million (equivalent to US$257 million) in assets. According to the prospectus, BlackRock Canada has appointed two affiliates as lending agents for the fund, including BlackRock Institutional Trust Company (BTC), based in San Francisco, and BlackRock Advisors (UK) Limited (BAL), headquartered in London. Under the structure, borrowers must post collateral worth at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities. That collateral may take the form of cash or other securities, which are marked to market daily. BlackRock also provides a borrower default indemnity, committing to replace any securities not returned in the event of borrower failure. To limit exposure, no more than 50% of a fund’s net asset value may be on loan at any time. Cash collateral, when received, can only be invested in highly liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less. The program will be supported by BlackRock’s internal risk management team, which uses proprietary technology and quantitative models to monitor exposures. The firm emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate sensitivity when investing cash collateral, reflecting an approach designed to safeguard against market disruptions. Despite the safeguards, securities lending introduces risks that could impact holders. Some of these include borrowers’ delays or failures to return securities, potentially preventing the ETF from participating in corporate actions such as mergers or dividends. Market conditions could also lead lending agents to scale back activity, reducing potential revenue. Furthermore, shifts in tax or regulatory rules may alter the treatment of loaned securities, delaying or reducing payments owed to the fund. Still, BlackRock stresses that collateralization above 100% and its indemnity arrangement reduce the chance of investor loss. The policy ensures that, even if a borrower defaults, BlackRock should be able to restore its portfolio without a material impact. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Euronext says one ETF listing will reduce costs. Photo: Bloomberg Irish retail investors now have the opportunity to buy a wider range of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the European market at lower cost, the stock-exchange operator Euronext has said. Promising to “unify the European ETF market” and remove long-standing structural inefficiencies, Euronext is creating the first fully integrated marketplace for the increasingly popular funds. Instead of having to list the same instrument on several European exchanges, issuers will now be able to use a single listing. The new model also combines the clearing and settlement system. At present, according to Euronext, the fragmentation of the market has led to much trading of ETFs happening over-the-counter or on alternative trading platforms, reducing transparency and making sales more complex. Euronext operates the stock markets in France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Belgium and Portugal as well as Ireland. It says there are currently 3,500 ETF listings in Europe, of which about 2,100 are in Milan, 750 in Paris, and 700 in Amsterdam. Some 834 ETFs are cross listed between Amsterdam, Paris and Milan. The new system will mean that ETF listers no longer have to put the same instrument on multiple venues in order to make them available to all retail investors in Europe At present, the average number of listings per ETF in Europe is 3.5, From now on, Euronext says, the listing location will not matter, and all ETF trades will be done on a single platform, with an efficient post-trade process. The complexity of the post-trade arrangements, which vary from market to market, have meant that every-day investors participate less in the European markets than their counterparts in America. There had been speculation that Euronext would instead force the relocation of all ETF listings to one market, such as Amsterdam. “Investors, particularly retail participants, will enjoy more transparent, cost-effective access to a wider array of ETFs from across Europe supported by deeper liquidity, greater price visibility, and a broader selection at more competitive rates,” the stock exchange operator said. “Issuers will also be able to list a broad range of products, covering multiple asset classes and underlying benchmarks, and to offer the same product in different currency denominations, thereby enhancing flexibility and alignment with investor demand across jurisdictions.” Euronext says one ETF listing will reduce costs. Photo: Bloomberg Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 30th Euronext says that issuers representing over 90pc of European ETF assets and major brokers support its new platform, including BlackRock, BNP Paribas Asset Management, HSBC Asset Management, and Vangard Sarah Melvin, head of European client business at BlackRock, said: “We have long been supportive of efforts to grow capital markets in Europe as a way to enhance prosperity for Europeans and the competitiveness of the European economy. We believe unifying ETF trading will improve access and transparency for investors, helping bring down barriers to investing and contributing to more vibrant and deeper capital markets in Europe.” Andrea Busi, chief executive at Directa, said the platform was aiming to meet the needs of an ever-growing number of investors. “In the first half of 2025, Directa’s clients made twice the number of transactions on ETF compared to 2024: a clear sign of the level of appeal these financial products have reached among Italian retail investors."

Check out our Live Bitcoin Hyper Updates for September 30, 2025! In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $110K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Bitcoin is putting up a strong September close, gaining over 3% in the last 3-4 days. Even though its monthly gain so far is around 4.5%, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s average September return across recorded history has been -4.44%. This makes the current move a notable step up, and an early signal that we could be heading into an explosive Q4. On the daily chart, Bitcoin has now reclaimed key short-term moving averages, including the 50, 20, and 10 EMAs. This further confirms that a rebound is indeed underway. And on the weekly chart, Bitcoin has been wrestling with the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone for 3-4 weeks. Finally, last week, it closed comfortably above it with a bullish hammer candle, suggesting that the pullback from its strong April rally (which pushed it to an all-time high of $124,500 in early August) is now complete, and the token is ready for its next bull run. September 30, 2025 • 15:12 UTC It’s a great day for Wall Street as BlackRock overtook Deribit as the largest Bitcoin options avenue in 2025, according to Bloomberg. This comes three months after the company’s spot Bitcoin ETF became the fastest to surpass $70B in assets under management (AUM) in June. IBIT’s open interest in options reached $38B on Friday, compared to Deribit’s $32B, Bloomberg data shows. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and its upcoming Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which is currently in a $19.3M presale. Hyper aims for a Q4 release and promises faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for improved performance and scalability. Read our price prediction for $HYPER right here. September 30, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Swift just announced the release of a blockchain-based ledger to allow for ‘trusted movement of tokenized value across the digital ecosystems.’ The ledger will monitor and validate transactions and rely on smart contracts to enforce rules and create a ‘real-time log of transactions between financial institutions’. Read more. This is good news for Bitcoin, as well as its coming Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). Currently in a $19.3M presale, Hyper promises cheaper and faster transactions, turning the Bitcoin network more responsive, performant, and scalable. Discover what Bitcoin Hyper is all about right here. September 30, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Massachusetts released an update to its Bitcoin strategic reserve bill introduced back in February, setting October 7 as the date for a Joint Revenue Committee hearing. The goal is to establish a cryptocurrency reserve that encompasses multiple assets, including Bitcoin. Michigan has a similar bill, pending since February, while states like North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana failed to pass theirs. If approved, the bill could establish a precedent for other states to follow, thereby enhancing the legitimacy of the crypto sector. This would support Bitcoin’s predicted October run, with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) coming strong from the rear. The $19.3M presale supports Hyper’s growing ecosystem, which promises faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions once the Hyper Layer 2 releases. Learn what Bitcoin Hyper is right here. September 30, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy just bought 196 more Bitcoins for a total investment of $22.1M, according to the recent filing. This latest investment raised the company’s Bitcoin reserve to 640,031 coins, worth nearly $74B. Alt text – Strategy’s Bitcoin purchase history Given Michael Saylor’s tendency to always buy the dip, this recent purchase sounds bullish for October’s Bitcoin, especially in light of the coming FOMC meeting at the end of the month. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) also makes solid gains heading into Q4, with the $19.3M presale seeing a surge in investor support. Hyper promises faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions thanks to tools like Solana Virtual Machine and the Canonical Bridge, which improve Bitcoin’s performance, finality times, and scalability. Read our price prediction for $HYPER right here. September 30, 2025 • 11:00 UTC Bitcoin’s bad luck seems to have ended after three days of floating in the $109K shallow waters. $BTC finally broke $114K yesterday, which signals strong momentum as October closes in. Despite contracting a bit since, Bitcoin still looks bullish, between the coming FOMC meeting and Strategy getting another batch of 196 $BTC for $22M yesterday. Read more. With Bitcoin in full rally mode, Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $19.2M is making massive progress in preparation for its potential Q4 release. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 upgrade, Hyper promises faster and cheaper on-chain transactions, making Bitcoin more scalable, reliable, and responsive. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. September 30, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has overtaken Coinbase’s Deribit platform, making it the largest venue for Bitcoin options globally. Open interest in options tied to IBIT recently reached almost $38B, compared to $32B on Deribit. Founded in 2016, Deribit has led the market in the Bitcoin derivatives sector ever since. On the other hand, IBIT was launched in November 2024 and has turned heads with its rapid adoption and remarkable growth. IBIT holds the record for crossing $80B in assets under management (AUM) in just 374 trading days (the fastest ETF to reach that milestone). With IBIT now holding 57.5% of all Bitcoin ETF assets under management, institutional conviction in $BTC has grown stronger than ever. As Bitcoin’s momentum builds, upcoming projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which is still in presale, stand to win big. For degens who have had enough of the boomer-chain lag, Hyper comes as a Layer 2 solution that processes transactions in milliseconds with dust fees. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is in our detailed guide here. September 30, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin reclaimed $114K after three days of floating around the $109K zone. This is rather unexpected given the strong outflows recorded over the past several days, which casts doubt on Bitcoin’s ability to preserve its momentum. This hints at several underlying factors that may fuel $BTC’s performance, including the weakness of the labor market that redirects investors to crypto, the coming rate cut at October’s FOMC meeting, and the growing institutional adoption. Read more. With Bitcoin holding strong, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) gains increased attention thanks to its booming presale and long-term potential. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solution, promising faster and cheaper transactions, Hyper raised over $19.2M so far and it’s growing fast. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is right here.

Title: Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF inflows top $1B: Fidelity leads, BlackRock lags

A broad V-shaped day: Fidelity funds dominated while Ark, Grayscale and Bitwise added; flows bolster risk appetite after weeks of outflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew more than $1 billion in net inflows on Sept. 29, signaling renewed investor confidence after weeks of heavy outflows. The sharp turnaround also came as the broader crypto market sentiment improved and prices staged a notable rebound. Data from SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin ETFs captured $521.95 million in inflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC accounting for the bulk of activity. The fund pulled in $298.70 million, which is more than half of the day’s net total. Other major contributors included Ark 21Shares’ ARKB, which saw $62.18 million in inflows, Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB, which contributed approximately $47 million each, and Invesco’s BTCO attracted $35.34 million in fresh capital. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL added $30.66 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC brought in $26.91 million. Smaller but notable gains came from Franklin Templeton’s EZBC at $16.51 million and Valkyrie’s BRRR at $4.03 million. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT, the dominant Bitcoin ETF, was the only product to register losses, with $46.64 million in outflows. This marked the fund’s third day of withdrawals in September. On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs saw even stronger inflows on the day, totaling $546.96 million. Fidelity’s FETH led the charge with $202.18 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA at $154.20 million. Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE added $99.84 million and $22.77 million, respectively, while Bitwise’s ETHW saw $36.52 million in inflows. The inflows coincided with a sharp recovery in asset prices, reinforcing the view that institutional demand remains highly sensitive to market signals. Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, pointed out that Bitcoin climbed back to $114,000, erasing much of the prior week’s losses and forming a sharp V-shaped recovery. According to him, BTC investors consistently defended the $110,000 to $111,000 range, creating a sequence of higher lows that strengthened bullish conviction. Misir continued that the resistance lies between $115,000 and $116,300. He noted that consolidation in that zone is likely before any push higher, but stressed that as long as Bitcoin trades above $109,000, momentum remains constructive.

Title: BlackRock Dethrones Coinbase in Bitcoin Options – Why Bitcoin Hyper Presale Could Be the Next Big Winner
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/blackrock-leads-bitcoin-options-bitcoin-hyper-presale/
Time Published: 2025-09-30T07:10:06Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform, becoming the largest venue for Bitcoin options globally. Open interest in options tied to IBIT recently reached nearly $38B, compared to $32B on Deribit, according to a Bloomberg report. Deribit was founded in 2016 and has been the market leader for Bitcoin derivatives for the longest time. In contrast, launched only in November 2024, IBIT is relatively new to the options trading market. Its early and rapid adoption has turned heads in the crypto world. IBIT has had a remarkable growth since its inception. For starters, the firm crossed $80B in assets under management (AUM) in just 374 trading days – the fastest for an ETF to reach that milestone. With IBIT now holding 57.5% of all Bitcoin ETF assets under management, Wall Street’s message is clear: institutional conviction in $BTC has never been stronger. IBIT overtaking Derbit suggests that the center of gravity in crypto derivatives is shifting toward regulated US-based venues. Additionally, IBIT’s increasing options liquidity enhances its credibility, which attracts more capital, creating a cycle of deeper liquidity and market presence. While IBIT may have overtaken Deribit in volume, Deribit continues to retain a strong following among crypto-native traders as a top crypto exchange for speculative and high-leverage trades, particularly in offshore or less-regulated contexts. As more capital enters, it helps support price and deepens liquidity, making the coin less vulnerable to extreme volatility or flash crashes. Together, these trends indicate that the market is pulling in two directions — crypto natives are sticking with Deribit, while institutions are pouring into IBIT. What’s more, as open interest in Bitcoin-linked options increases, the derivatives market plays a more important role in price discovery. IBIT’s dominance means its options could increasingly influence Bitcoin’s implied volatility, hedging flows, and directional pressures. This deeper market structure feeds directly into broader momentum. Sustained inflows via ETFs and derivatives in a bullish cycle can generate ‘flywheel effects,’ meaning that more capital will attract more liquidity, which in turn brings in even more capital. With macroeconomic factors like inflation, monetary easing, and geopolitical risks prompting investors to seek alternative stores of value, $BTC is well-positioned to capture demand. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the latest crypto project attempting to turbocharge Bitcoin with Solana-like speed, scalability, and Web3 support. The project is developing a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that will integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling the execution of thousands of unrelated transactions in parallel. Bitcoin Hyper rises to modern blockchain standards by processing the transactions off-chain, but without compromising Bitcoin Layer 1 security. That’s because it batches the transaction results and submits a summary to the Bitcoin main chain, ensuring instantaneous execution. Here are a few other features that make $HYPER worth watching: Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and be part of Bitcoin’s next chapter. Now that we have an idea of what the project aims to achieve, let’s get into how to buy $HYPER and why participating in the Bitcoin Hyper presale can deliver value to early investors. One Hyper now sits at $0.013005 with dynamic staking rewards of 61% APY. If analysts are correct, $HYPER’s price could rise to $0.02595 by the end of 2025 and to $0.08625 by 2026. To put this into perspective, if you invest $500 into Hyper today, you could stand to gain around $1,606 in just one year — that’s price appreciation plus staking rewards. In other words, a 3.2x return. Remember, the staking APY decreases as more participants join, and the next expected price jump is scheduled for tomorrow. Secure your $HYPER today for the highest potential gains. This is not financial advice. The markets can be volatile and speculative.

Title: Crypto ETFs Suffer Worst Streak Since Launch as Bitcoin and Ethereum Record Heavy Outflows

Time Published: 2025-09-30T03:00:45Z

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs experienced their worst weekly stretch since debut, as risk appetite declined and investors de-risked heading into quarter-end. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw approximately $902.5 million in net outflows for the week of Sept. 22–26, ending a four-week inflow streak. Ethereum ETFs lost about $795.6 million, marking their largest weekly redemptions since launch. The outflows were uneven: Fidelity’s FBTC led BTC outflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT and Invesco’s BTCO defied the trend with $173.8 million and $10 million of inflows, respectively. On the ETH side, several issuers experienced large single-day withdrawals, showing how quickly flows can reverse when macro risk increases. The reversal came as traders weighed new U.S. tariff announcements and lingering uncertainty about the Fed’s rate cuts ahead of key inflation data. Those headlines revived fears of a growth and liquidity squeeze, driving a quick reset across risk assets. Bitcoin briefly slipped below pivotal support intraday before rebounding, while Ethereum mirrored the move with a shallow bounce. Despite the week’s pain, September still shows net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs ($2.57B), a notable improvement from August’s outflows, evidence that institutional adoption remains intact. For now, the market’s message is clear: without a more dovish macro backdrop or cleaner inflation prints, allocators may remain selective, trimming core BTC/ETH exposure when it is strong and adding only on clear confirmations. Beneath the headline of redemptions, some desks report rotations toward thematic or alternative crypto ETFs (e.g., Solana, XRP) as allocators seek uncorrelated catalysts. That discussion overlaps with speculation about a potential BlackRock XRP spot ETF, with market models suggesting $4–$8B of first-year inflows if such a product were filed and approved. Although no filing has been confirmed, XRP’s quick settlement times and low fees keep it on institutions’ radar. Nevertheless, the week’s outflows serve as a reminder: macro factors outweigh micro in the short term. As October progresses, focus on whether BTC funds resume steady inflows, if ETH redemptions decrease, and how upcoming inflation data influences Fed expectations. Until these factors align positively, volatility will remain high, and ETF flow reports will continue to be the best real-time indicators of institutional confidence.

Title: Crypto Goes Mainstream

ByDan Ikenson, Contributor. When businesses operate in transparent, predictable environments and have new markets to tap or efficiencies to extract, investment and game-changing innovations are sure to follow. That, in a nutshell, explains why we have witnessed a broad, mainstream embrace of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies in 2025. Innovation is essential to economic growth; investment is the lifeblood of innovation; and policy clarity is crucial to identifying and estimating the value of the risks and rewards of investment. For years, legal uncertainty presented a very high barrier to institutional use of cryptocurrencies for financial transaction settlement. Firms could not reliably determine whether a token was a security, a commodity, or something else. Nor could they be sure which agency would enforce the rules. That ambiguity deterred “on-chain” innovation. But recent legislation signed into law and an energized Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that is dedicated to clarifying how securities laws apply to cryptocurrencies herald a new approach in Washington. That approach is playing a catalytic role, inspiring a significant number of announcements of large investments and cross-industry collaborations among technology companies and financial services firms. Industry analyses indicate that use of tokenized cash and real-world assets is growing fast, as financial institutions seek efficiency, contract programmability, and new liquidity pools. Tokenized instruments can enable near-instantaneous financial settlement relative to the long tie-ups associated with the traditional settlement cycles. At its core, settlement is about transferring value and updating records that reflect ownership. Traditional settlement relies on layers of intermediaries, batch processes, and often 24- to 72-hour windows to reconcile books across institutions — even longer when those transactions occur across borders. Blockchains and tokenized cash shorten that chain: tokens move peer-to-peer on a shared ledger, transactions settle nearly instantaneously, and smart contracts can automate conditional transfers. For businesses, that translates into lower counterparty risk, less capital tied up, and simpler reconciliation. For cross-border payments, tokenized liquidity can dramatically cut costs and time relative to legacy methods. Stablecoins now represent a sizable pool of on-chain liquidity used for settlement and trading. Banks and custodians have launched custody products and tokenization services. Payment networks and financial utilities see tokenization initiatives as the only way to remain competitive. Even legacy providers are integrating – or signaling intent to integrate – blockchain settlement or tokenized currencies into their offerings, which is a persuasive indicator that the market views on-chain settlement as an economic imperative rather than a speculative fad. Last week, investment management behemoths BlackRock and VanEck announced plans to tokenize some of their money market funds using Ripple Lab’s stablecoin (RluSD) as their on-chain digital currency. Through smart contracts devised and executed on a platform designed by financial technology firm Securitize, fund holders will be able to redeem fund assets for on-chain liquidity directly, creating what Ripple calls a 24/7 stablecoin off-ramp for tokenized treasuries. This endeavor comes on the heels of a similar venture in which Franklin Templeton and Ripple are collaborating to help the financial service company’s fund investors better manage market volatility by providing tokenized trading to shift funds between stable coins and yield-generating assets, and to provide lending services for institutional investors. Meanwhile, citing the new favorable regulatory environment, Morgan Stanley recently announced plans to invest $100 million in Zero Hash, a crypto infrastructure provider, to build and launch a digital asset trading platform by 2026. What is becoming apparent is that tokenization will enable the financial system to extricate and monetize the assets that are laying fallow, buried in the inefficiencies of outdated settlement and custody rules. But it also will provide market participants with the opportunity to use tokens as on-chain collateral and make it economically feasible to break assets into much smaller pieces, broadening investor access to securities and credit. Cryptocurrencies are finally moving from niche experiment to mainstream plumbing for financial settlement. After more than a decade of hype, boom-and-bust cycles, and regulatory whiplash, a set of coinciding forces — clearer rules from U.S. regulators, targeted legislation, growing institutional infrastructure, and real product demand for faster, cheaper cross-border settlement — have created a credible pathway for digital assets to be used for payment and settlement at scale.

Title: Introducing Open Issuance from Bridge: A new platform to launch your own stablecoin

Businesses are increasingly using stablecoins to get paid, store funds, and manage treasury operations—accelerating their ability to reach customers, launch borderless financial services, and manage costs. One thing is holding businesses back: they’re building on top of stablecoins issued by an external provider. The market is currently dominated by a small group of issuers, and their scale, liquidity, and brand recognition have made their stablecoins easy to use. But building atop these stablecoins means businesses don’t get to participate in the economics, face unpredictable fees, and are ultimately beholden to the issuers’ roadmaps. Today, we’re fixing that. Open Issuance is a new platform that allows any business to launch and manage its own stablecoin. With its own stablecoin, a business can control its product experience, mint and burn without limits or unnecessary fees, and earn rewards from reserves. Businesses using Open Issuance plug into a shared liquidity network to reduce costs and get to market quickly—without depending on a handful of incumbent issuers. Companies across industries and business models can create their own stablecoins, including: This infrastructure is already powering its first real-world use case: Phantom, a crypto wallet with a community of more than 15 million users, is launching a new stablecoin, CASH, on the Open Issuance platform. CASH will form the foundation of Phantom’s native money movement features—users can spend CASH, send to friends, use it across DeFi, or convert it seamlessly to fiat and other stablecoins. In addition to CASH, coins already issued by Bridge will move over to the new platform, including USDH, the Hyperliquid native stablecoin built by Native Markets, and coins from MetaMask, Dakota, Slash, Lava, and Takenos. Open Issuance allows you to launch a stablecoin in just a few days. Bridge handles reserve management, security, liquidity, and GENIUS-ready compliance so you can focus on your end customers. While Open Issuance will come with a set of simple defaults, nearly every aspect of your stablecoin can be customized, including: We’re also building a whole suite of tools to help you increase adoption for your custom stablecoin with onramps, offramps, wallets, cards, and more from Bridge, Privy, and Stripe. Introducing new stablecoins presents an obvious challenge: building liquidity. Open Issuance solves this by design: businesses can enable their stablecoin to be interoperable (a one-for-one swap) with other Open Issuance stablecoins. As new stablecoins launch, overall liquidity expands, strengthening the entire network. This means businesses can customize their stablecoin to fit their needs without building liquidity all on their own, while end customers can swap easily. The ability to swap between these stablecoins is live in the Bridge API today. For example, say a user is holding $10 in Phantom CASH and wants to swap it with $10 of USDH. Previously, they would have to go to an exchange, offramp to USD, and then purchase USDH, incurring multiple fees and facing friction along the way. In the future, Phantom CASH users will be able to swap their funds with other Open Issuance stablecoins using an instant, permissionless transaction that is onchain—no intermediary required. In the coming weeks, we will be announcing more stablecoin launches and share more on the platform design of Open Issuance. At Bridge, our mission is to equip builders with the tools they need to create better financial experiences. Open Issuance is a big step forward, empowering you to control your product vision and own your economics. If you’re thinking about launching your own stablecoin, contact the Bridge team.

SEC grants Dimensional Fund Advisors approval for ETF share classes of mutual funds. This move could reshape the $12.6 trillion ETF industry September 29, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- The US Securities and Exchange Commission intends to grant Dimensional Fund Advisors the ability to offer ETFs as share classes of mutual funds, opening the door for widespread use of a tax-saving structure previously exclusive to Vanguard Group. “The SEC has published a notice indicating they intend to grant our funds relief to offer ETF share classes,” Gerard O’Reilly, co-chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer at the firm, said in a press release. The notice comes after Dimensional filed an amendment to its exemptive relief application on Friday. The SEC’s Monday notice said it will grant so-called exemptive relief to Dimensional to offer dual share class funds unless the commission orders a hearing. Roughly 70 other asset managers are waiting to hear back from the SEC on their applications. The long-awaited regulatory approval is set to be a major win for asset managers seeking to shrink clients’ tax bills and expand into the $12.6 trillion ETF industry as mutual funds lose ground to the generally cheaper, easier-to-trade wrapper. The novel fund design, where one share class of a mutual fund is exchange-traded, was invented by Vanguard more than two decades ago. Since the firm’s patent expired in 2023, nearly every major money manager — including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. — has asked the SEC for permission to use the dual share class model. Related:Advisors React to the Arrival of Dual-Share Fund Classes “This relief hits the trifecta: it increases retail investment options, lowers costs and expenses for the average American investor, and advances innovation,” said the SEC’s Brian Daly. Vanguard’s patent expiration proved to be just the first obstacle cleared for rivals. The bigger hurdle was waiting for the SEC to grant exemptive relief from current ETF rules to use the structure. Vanguard itself is part of the most recent round of applicants, as it has so far only received permission to use the structure in passive funds. The SEC had been relatively quiet on the status of the applications under Gary Gensler’s leadership. Optimism grew in March when Mark Uyeda, the regulator’s Acting Chair at the time, said that he was directing the staff to prioritize a review of the “many applications.” Shortly after, Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first hopeful to file an amendment to its application, signaling further progress on the SEC front. “This is one of those things that sounds wonky but has potentially massive implications as millions of investors with trillions in assets sitting in mutual funds will now be able to access an ETF version of that strategy,” said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While there are some operational hurdles still, we see this is a new tributary of flows into ETFs.” Related:11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Sept. 30, 2025) The landmark regulatory shift is set to have wide-ranging effects on Wall Street, if fund firms add exchange-traded fund shares to mutual funds en masse.

Title: Frontal and parietal planning signals encode adapted motor commands when learning to control a brain–computer interface

Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain–computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

Recent advancements have extended this approach to signals obtained from the parietal cortex [7–10]. Besides their translational applications, BCI paradigms provide a crucial tool for studying the neurophysiological basis of motor learning [11–23]. Unlike conventional motor learning paradigms involving physical limb movement, BCI control establishes an experimentally controllable mapping from brain activity to effector motion through the neural decoder. Additionally, BCI paradigms help isolate the impact of visual feedback on movement adaptation by keeping proprioceptive feedback constant during visuomotor perturbations [16]. This approach reduces potential confounds inherent in the adaptation of physical movements, which co-vary with proprioceptive feedback, and emphasizes the visual aspect of feedback control. In our study, we employ a BCI visuomotor rotation paradigm in rhesus monkeys to explore the role of visual feedback and the contributions of parietal and premotor sensorimotor areas to BCI adaptation. We ask whether both brain regions (i) contribute to adaptation irrespective of an immediate impact on the produced motor behavior, (ii) reflect the same or different sensory or motor-related spatial dimensions of fast visuomotor adaptation, and (iii) show adaptation of motor planning activity consistent with motor behavior. In BCI learning, behavioral performance can be improved by exploiting an existing repertoire of neural dynamic states (“within-manifold” learning) or by reconfiguring the neural network structure (“outside-manifold” learning). In response to perturbations of a BCI decoder, short-term learning does not appear to significantly affect the correlation patterns among neurons in the motor cortex [15,20,24]. This suggests that at least the local network structure supplying input to the decoder (i.e., the controlling motor area) remains largely unchanged and constrains neural adaptation during short-term learning. However, with longer-term learning, the brain can be trained to generate new activity patterns in the controlling units that deviate from the expected correlation pattern of the network. Such outside-manifold learning aligns with the view that the tuning of individual neurons can be adapted independently during BCI learning [13,24–25]. A way how the decoder input could be adapted without changing the network structure is by means of “re-association”. According to this view, a specific neural activity pattern associated with compensating for the introduced visuomotor perturbation is recruited from the range of patterns available within the existing network structure [15,18–21]. This view implies changes in activity, but under the constraint of an unchanged network structure also for neighboring neurons, such that also noncontrolling units in the controlling area that do not provide input to the decoder adapt their activity in a manner consistent with changes in the BCI controlling units. Based on these previous findings, we expect that the comparatively fast adaptation to visuomotor rotation, achievable within a single session of a few hundred trials, is accompanied by such re-association learning. After establishing that this is indeed the case in our visuomotor adaptation task, we will test three implications of this hypothesis. First, we will address the question of whether changes in neural activity during BCI learning occur consistently not only in nearby noncontrolling neurons, as shown previously [13,18,28], but also across a larger-scale sensorimotor network, including frontoparietal circuits. Previous studies in humans and monkeys have not extensively examined the extent of adaptation within a distributed neural network, including regions that are not directly involved in generating or updating motor commands but may still play a crucial role in sensorimotor integration. These regions, such as the parietal cortex, are expected to contribute to motor learning [29,30]. In a human BCI motor learning study involving the prefrontal cortex, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), primary motor and sensory cortices, and the posterior parietal cortex, neural changes occurred with long-term learning and were associated nonspecifically with reduced cognitive demand [31]. In contrast, we aim to understand the neural characteristics of fast adaptation, which is particularly desirable for BCI learning and, in conventional visuomotor rotation learning, is often associated with the updating of an internal model [32,33]. Fast adaptation is especially important for BCI applications because it enables users to achieve accurate and efficient control with minimal training time, which is critical for practical and clinical use. We compare the contributions of noncontrolling neurons residing locally next to the BCI controlling neurons in the frontal areas or remotely in parietal areas to test if fast adaptation effects generalize to remote brain regions. Second, we ask whether premotor and parietal brain regions not only both adapt but do so in the same spatial frame of reference. Specifically, we test if neural changes reflect the adapted motor command (this is mandatory for the controlling units, but unclear for noncontrolling units) or if the parietal cortex rather reflects the associated adapted sensory feedback. Preparatory activity in frontoparietal motor planning areas includes information about the reach goal represented in different body-related frames of reference. While encoding at the level of neural populations and often also at the level of the individual neurons shows typically mixed representations of different reference frames, different coding schemes predominate across areas. For example, the parietal reach region (PRR) in the medial intraparietal area (MIP) predominantly encodes reach targets in an eye-centered reference frame [34], whereas area 5d in the posterior parietal cortex represents reach goals more strongly in a hand-centered frame [35]. PRR representations can relate both to the visual location and the physical goal of the movement [36,37]. Nearby sensorimotor areas V6A in the anterior wall of the parieto-occipital sulcus and PEc at its shoulder show gradually more selectivity for the hand position, additionally to target and gaze-related information [38–40]. Similarly, the PMd encodes reach targets in a mixed reference frame, integrating the relative positions of the hand, eye, and target [41,42]. Thus, while both premotor and parietal regions are involved in reach planning and show overlapping tuning properties during instructed delay, they differ with respect to their neuroanatomical embedding. Posterior parietal networks integrate sensory information from multiple modalities, including visual input, and contain motor-goal information during reach planning without directly driving motor output [43,44]. Premotor cortex, on the other hand, has direct connections to primary motor cortex (M1) and its more caudal parts even to spinal cord [45]. Here, we test if these differences between frontal and parietal motor planning areas reflect in differences in the predominant frame of reference when motor command and sensory feedback are dissociated during sensorimotor adaptation. During a visual working memory task, frontoparietal areas can even contain spatial information not related to the body, but relative to a visual object, which is an allocentric form of spatial representation [46]. The possibility of such spatial coding in a reach context, which does not reflect the planned physical arm movement, raises the question in which spatial frame of reference frontoparietal cortex represents reach-associated information during BCI learning and whether parietal and frontal areas share a common frame of reference. Rather than reflecting trial-to-trial updates of the corrected movement to produce adapted motor outputs, as observed in the motor and premotor cortices [11,28,47,48], parietal dynamics could reflect the unchanged sensory state of the system during the planning period before movement onset, as part of its role in state estimation [49–55]. Third, we propose that motor adaptation is reflected in changes in motor signals during movement preparation already and that planning activities co-vary with signals during movement control. Fast adaptation at the neural level has been previously described from a dynamical system perspective [22,23,56–58]. According to this view, the neural state, which represents the activity pattern across the population of neurons in motor areas, follows established dynamics to generate movements [59–63]. During movement preparation, the neural state is initialized with different conditions for different movements and then evolves based on the network-inherent dynamics during movement execution. This concept is particularly applicable to ballistic reaches toward spatially segregated targets in space. The fixed neural dynamics are determined by the stable recurrent connectivity of the network itself [19,61,64]. According to this view, adaptation could be implemented by updating of the initial states. Hence, adaptation induced neural changes should reflect in late planning activity, at a time when uncertainty about the position of a BCI-controlled cursor position deteriorates planning signals [65]. Over the course of fast adaptation, the idea, neural dynamics are initialized with changing conditions to compensate for movement errors from trial to trial, while the network structure in the motor cortex remains stable. A BCI learning study in monkeys indicated that such adaptive state initialization probably applies to BCI controlling units in the motor cortex [23]. In line with this finding, other work suggested that motor learning involves systematic changes in preparatory activity within the motor cortex to adapt to a force field [66]. It is yet unclear to what extent such adaptation of initial states also applies to changes in preparatory activity in the larger frontoparietal network, including noncontrolling units and areas outside the motor cortex. By introducing an instructed delay in the BCI movement task, we can compare adaptation of the preparatory states with the movement-associated dynamics. We ask whether such a relationship between the two states exists also for visuomotor adaptation and whether the relationship changes over the course of learning. In this study, we conducted a 3D visuomotor rotation task under BCI control to investigate neural adaptation across the distributed frontoparietal network, including M1, PMd, and PRR. We selectively connected only a subset of units, referred to as controlling units, to the decoder to assess whether neural signatures of adaptation extend beyond the units immediately controlling the BCI movements. After demonstrating visuomotor rotation adaptation in BCI control of 3D movements and its compatibility with the idea of fast within-manifold learning, we address our three main research questions. First, we test if adaptation is distributed and also affects the coding in parietal areas, remote from the frontal lobe areas that controlled the BCI movements. Second, we determine the spatial frame of reference in which the noncontrolling units co-vary with the controlling units that determine the behavior. Third, we test the hypothesis that re-association learning leads to adaptation of movement planning signals consistent with the observed adaptation in motor behavior. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying movement planning and execution, we designed an experiment to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during a memory-guided reach task under BCI control. Two rhesus monkeys (Y and Z) performed a memory-guided 3D center-out reach task using a computer cursor in a virtual reality (VR) environment (Figs 1A and S1A). The task involved the presentation of a target, followed by a memory period during which the target was no longer visible. The monkeys were then required to move the cursor to the previously cued target in a corner of a 3D cube (Fig 1B). This delay period between target presentation and movement execution allowed us to investigate adaptive changes in neural dynamics during movement planning, independent of immediate sensory feedback, and compare these to the adapted motor commands during execution.

During MC trials, the cursor movements in virtual space were aligned with the animals’ hand movements in physical space. In BCI trials, the monkeys kept their unrestrained hand in a resting position while controlling the cursor mentally. S1B Fig shows that residual hand movements were minimal and barely correlated with cursor speed (Pearson’s correlation: monkey Y, r = 0.085, p < 0.001, n (total number of decoded speeds) = 575,258; monkey Z, r = 0.072, p < 0.001, n = 108,933). This means the animal managed to control the cursor movement without any longer attempting own physical movements, neither during planning nor during movement, which ensured a constant somatosensory input during BCI trials. During baseline trials, i.e., without visuomotor perturbation, monkey Y successfully drove the cursor to the target in 99% of the movement trials (trials in which the animal successfully completed the planning period without, e.g., fixation breaks; see Materials and methods) under MC and in 89% of the BCI trials. Monkey Z succeeded in 97% of the movement trials under MC and in 85% of the BCI trials. Only successful trials were analyzed. We recorded brain activity from three regions: the primary M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y had 64 electrodes in each of M1, PMd, and PRR, while monkey Z had 64 electrodes in M1 and 96 electrodes in each of PMd and PRR (S1C Fig). Units from all three areas were selectively connected (controlling units) or not connected (noncontrolling units) to the decoder (Fig 1D). This design allowed us to investigate whether adaptive mechanisms in individual neurons depended on their immediate causal influence on movement, which is only guaranteed for connected units. Subsets of PMd and M1 units were always involved in the decoder, whereas PRR units were either entirely connected (in combination with PMd-M1; Decoder fronto-parietal (FP), Fig 1D, lower) or completely disconnected (Decoder frontal-only (FO), Fig 1D, upper). This setup enabled us to study adaptive mechanisms in PRR even without its direct involvement in generating movements and to compare it to the case when PRR directly contributes to the control of BCI movements. We utilized a short-term visuomotor rotation (VMR) adaptation paradigm tailored to our 3D experimental setup [67] to induce repeated BCI learning (Fig 2). In the daily sessions, first, the decoder was recalibrated until animals became proficient in controlling unperturbed cursor movements without computer support (see Materials and methods). We then recorded 160 baseline trials before we introduced the perturbation, a rotation of 30° to the visual feedback (cursor) in the fronto-parallel X–Y plane, for 300 trials (Fig 2A). In each daily session, the perturbation was consistently either clockwise or counterclockwise only (S1 Table). The perturbation was applied globally throughout the workspace, which means it affected movements to all eight targets but only in the X and Y dimensions, not in the depth dimension away from the body (Fig 2A, left). Finally, the perturbation was removed during the washout phase, which continued until the animals disengaged from the task (Fig 2A, right). In designing this study, we leveraged previous findings from [67], which showed that human subjects adapted most easily to perturbations applied in the fronto-parallel plane. (A) Left: visual representation of 3D-VMR. In different experimental sessions, the 3D movements were rotated 30° clockwise or counterclockwise in the frontal-parallel plane. The Z-axis points towards the monkey’s head and was unperturbed. Right: the experimental protocol consisted of a baseline phase followed by a 30° VMR and a washout phase where the visual perturbation was removed. Below each phase of the experimental progression, example traces from a single experimental session in Monkey Y are shown. (B) In the plane of the applied perturbation, deviations above the zero line correspond to positions in the visual signal plane. Conversely, negative deflections in trajectories exist in the motor signal plane and correspond to the motor commands issued to counteract the visual perturbation. For averaging across all target directions, the trajectories were rotated into a shared reference frame. One axis was aligned with the perturbed direction, while the other was aligned with the vector from the center to the target. In this plane, trajectories above the zero line represent positions in the visual signal plane, while trajectories below zero pertain to the motor signal plane. Additionally, we calculated the angle at the midpoint of each trajectory as the angle between the perturbation direction and the vector from the center to the target. (C) For the analysis, the 3D trajectories were projected onto the 2D plane of the applied perturbation. The trajectories showed stereotypical adaptation profiles during rotation and negative aftereffects during washout. (D) The angle at the midpoint of the trajectory, plotted as a function of trial number, reveals stereotypical adaptation profiles in response to the introduced VMR. The perturbation angle approaches 30° upon perturbation introduction, gradually decreases with learning, and then deviates in the opposite direction during the washout phase following perturbation removal. Numerical data are available in S1 Data. (A) Left: visual representation of 3D-VMR.

Numerical data are available in S1 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g002 To visualize movement adaptation, we projected the 3D movement trajectories of the controlled cursor into the X–Y plane affected by the perturbation (perturbation plane). During the baseline phase, the trajectories were on average relatively straight toward the target. During early rotation trials, as expected as a consequence of the perturbed feedback, trajectories in the perturbation plane curved in the direction of the applied feedback perturbation (Fig 2A, right). The average trajectories were less curved in late rotation trials. In the early washout phase, the trajectories on average curved in the opposite direction compared to during perturbation. The reduced curvature in late rotation trials and inverse curvature observed during washout indicate successful adaptation, which we quantified jointly across all target directions. To obtain averaged trajectories across targets, we rotated them for each target such that the X-axis aligned with the center-to-target direction and the Y-axis aligned orthogonally to this (perturbation direction, Fig 2B; see Materials and methods). Fig 2C depicts the average cursor trajectories across all eight targets and for all sessions for monkey Y. Additionally, the corresponding “motor” signal, representing the trajectories that would be produced by the unperturbed decoder using the neural activity of the controlling units, is visualized (Fig 2B–2C). To quantify adaptation, we calculated the trial-by-trial angular movement error (α) from the starting direction of the movement. To have a good enough estimate of movement direction while keeping the influence of online movement corrections small, we measured the angle of the cursor position at the halfway point of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting position and the target position (Fig 2C). On average, during baseline trials, the angular error was close to zero and did not decrease over time, as the fitted data with exponential decay did not show significant differences from zero (Monkey Y: intercept = 0.637, p = 0.26, decay = 0.006, p = 0.43, n = 51; Monkey Z: intercept = 1.5, p = 0.26, decay = 0.0029, p = 0.8, n = 15). It increased to about 20° at the onset of the VMR perturbation and gradually decreased as the monkeys adapted their neural activity to regain better control (Fig 2D). Fitting the data with an exponential decaying function during the perturbation phase indicated significant visuomotor adaptation (Monkey Y: n = 51, intercept = 20.99, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0026, p < 0.001; Monkey Z: n = 15, intercept = 20.69, p < 0.001, decay = −0.0018, p = 0.0017). During the washout phase, movement errors were committed in the opposite direction to the applied perturbation, consistent with a negative aftereffect as typically seen in visuomotor rotation adaptation. Fitting the data with an exponential decay revealed a significant intercept for both animals (Monkey Y: intercept = −11.63, p < 0.001, n = 26; Monkey Z: intercept = −17.255, p = 0.0018, n = 4), indicating significant aftereffects for both animals. These findings suggest a change in the sensorimotor transformation achieved during BCI adaptation trials. In BCI-controlled movements, behavioral changes represented by the cursor on the screen (i.e., the decoder output) directly mirror the activity of the neural population that controls the decoder. When faced with a VMR-type perturbation, this controlling neural group can restore its performance by re-associating certain target directions with different movement directions [15,18]. The re-association hypothesis means that the neurons can direct the cursor to the desired target using activity patterns consistent with those observed during the center-out reach task on which they were originally trained, associating a direction suited to compensate for the perturbing rotation. In contrast to the re-configuration hypothesis, the covariance structure between different neurons should change very little with re-associations, since the network remains stable. This stability implies that the neural dynamics that define the low-dimensional neural subspace (i.e., the neural manifold), which explains most of the neural variance before adaptation (during baseline), also explain most of the variance during perturbation and after adaptation (washout). To test the re-association versus re-configuration hypothesis, we calculated the alignment index [62] of the neural manifolds between the baseline trials and the other experimental phases (S2 Fig). Alignment should be high in the case of re-association. The alignment index is computed as the ratio of the explained variance when projecting the neural activity from the other experimental phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from the baseline activity (see Materials and methods section). We focused on the first four PCs, which capture the majority of the variance in the baseline trials (S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G Fig). Supporting the re-association hypothesis, we find that a substantial portion of the initially explained variance remains constant throughout the learning process. In fact, the average difference between the alignment indices during late rotation and the cross-validated alignment index during baseline is smaller than 1% for all the different neural populations that we calculated (S2 Fig). This suggests a preservation of the manifold structure during VMR adaptation in the frontal motor network. Our primary research goal was to identify the spatial reference frames of movement parameters encoded by neurons without a direct causal link to the movement (noncontrolling units) in frontal versus parietal brain areas. During BCI movements, noncontrolling units could encode movement parameters in either a visual coordinate system (reflecting the cursor movement) or a physical coordinate system (reflecting intended limb movements). To distinguish between these spatial encoding strategies, we used an offline decoding approach to reconstruct movement trajectories from noncontrolling units. First, a Kalman filter (KF) decoder (as for online decoding) was trained offline with neural activity of the noncontrolling units during BCI baseline trials (training set, Fig 3A) to reproduce the cursor trajectories actually produced by the animal with the controlling units during baseline. During unperturbed baseline trials, these trajectories represent both the motor command (of the controlling units) and visual cursor feedback alike, since both are spatially congruent (identical except for sensory noise). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the movement period. A velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the movement period, real BCI trajectories were used for regression with neural firing rates from noncontrolling neurons during baseline trials (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation.

Numerical data are available in S2 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g003 Second, this decoder was then applied to the neural activity during VMR trials of the same neural population (test set, Fig 3A). During VMR trials, the motor command of the controlling units and the visual cursor feedback are spatially incongruent. This allows us to test which spatial reference frame the noncontrolling units better correspond to. More specifically, the projection of the decoded trajectories along the perturbation axis (deflection measure) allowed us to study whether neural activity of the noncontrolling units during adaptation reflects (i) a stationary, nonadaptive signal (H1), (ii) the adapting visual cursor trajectories (H2), or (iii) the adapting motor signal as produced by the controlling units (H3). Straight trajectories to the target as during baseline would reflect a nonadaptive signal in noncontrolling populations, corresponding to a lack of deviation in the perturbation direction (Fig 3A). Deviation from baseline deflecting in the positive direction of the perturbation axis would reflect the visual signal (visual signal plane; corresponding to perturbation direction greater than 0), while deflection in the negative direction would reflect the motor command (motor signal space; corresponding to perturbation direction <0). In our results, the negatively deflected reconstructed trajectories in both animals show that noncontrolling units in M1 and PMd reflect the motor command similarly to controlling units (Fig 3B–3C). To accurately capture this deflection, we used a trajectory deflection measure in our analysis. This approach differs from the angular movement error (α) that we previously calculated to quantify adaptation, where α was measured at the midpoint of the trajectory relative to the straight line connecting the starting and target positions (Fig 2C). We chose the deflection measure for the reconstructed trajectories because it accounts for the overall shape and direction of the entire movement path. The mean deflection of the activity of monkey Y at the end of the movement (100%) was −8.69 mm ± 4.43 mm (mean ± standard deviation), significantly different from zero (one-sample t test, t(50) = −14.010, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, the mean deflection of activity at the end of the movement was also significantly below zero, at −9.88 mm ± 5.27 mm (t(14) = −7.250, p < 0.001). To isolate area-specific adaptation between M1 and PMd, we also tracked how each neuron’s preferred direction (PD) evolved during learning. This analysis revealed robust, systematic PD rotations that were independently measurable in both M1 and PMd (S4 Fig). These tuning shifts are well-aligned to partially compensate for the experimentally induced visual rotation. To gain deeper insight into the level of adaptation achieved by the noncontrolling neuronal population, we calculated the angle representing the deviation in the perturbation direction at the final level of adaptation. This angle was measured between the reconstructed trajectory of each population and the direct path to the target. To compare the adaptation levels across different populations, we then scaled the final angle reached by each neural subpopulation relative to that of the controlling unit population and called this the “relative gain.” The relative gain quantifies the deviation along the perturbation axis relative to the level of adaptation achieved. By expressing these deviations as a fraction of the total adaptation level exhibited by the controlling units, we could assess and compare how much each population contributed to adapting to the perturbation. Specifically, the M1-PMd noncontrolling population reached a relative gain of 59% for Monkey Y and 94% for Monkey Z, underscoring the significant adaptation observed in the M1-PMd noncontrolling population. We next investigated how VMR adaptation affects PRR activity, focusing on whether PRR’s adaptation-associated neural dynamics share the same spatial frame of reference as the frontal regions. By analyzing the adaptation process in PRR both with direct influence on movement control (decoder FP, controlling PRR units) and without it (decoder FO, noncontrolling PRR units), we determined whether PRR predominantly mirrors visual feedback or plays an active role similar to frontal areas. The overall neural yield in PRR was lower than in the combined M1-PMd recordings for both subjects. To still achieve similar baseline performance across conditions and to have enough noncontrolling units in PRR for analysis, the controlling PRR neurons were combined with a subset of M1-PMd units in the FP decoder sessions. This design choice was motivated by the fact that we observed lower performance in pre-testing trials when using PRR alone, possibly due to its weaker motor coding properties. Still, this experimental strategy allowed us to compare adaptation of PRR while partially causing the movement or not causing it directly at all. First, we evaluated whether the respective contributions of M1-PMd and PRR to the cursor movement were balanced during FP decoding, or rather predominated by M1-PMd inputs. Each cell’s contribution was determined by multiplying the norm of the vector that translates decoded speed into its firing rate summed with its baseline firing rate (Fig 4A), a similar approach as described in [68]. The distributions of the contribution values differed only modestly between PRR and M1-PMd (Cohen’s d: d = 0.67 for Monkey Y, d = 0.38 for Monkey Z). This suggests that both the PRR and M1-PMd areas similarly drive the motor output of the decoder. We also ensured that after baseline trials, neither of these areas significantly decreased their firing rate during adaptation which might indicate a substantial silencing of the area. Average firing rates between baseline and adaptation did not differ significantly (Mann–Whitney test, p > 0.05; Fig 4B). Together, these results indicate an active contribution of PRR to decoder adaptation. (A) Distributions of the norm of the linear regression vectors from velocity to neural firing rate for every single unit contributing to the decoder, color-coded depending on the neural population. Numerical data are available in S3 Data. (B) Mean firing rates for PRR and M1-PMd controlling units during baseline and late rotation epochs show that neither PRR nor M1-PMd is reducing their firing rate when compared to baseline (all p values nonsignificant with Mann–Witney test, n = 11 for Monkey Y, n = 5 for Monkey Z). Numerical data are available in S3 Data. (C) Similar to Fig 3C, the bar plots show the deflection of the trajectories at the end of the reach.

Numerical data are available in S2 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g004 Changes in PRR activity in response to the VMR exhibited motor-like characteristics similar to M1-PMd (Fig 4C). Across both decoder configurations (FP and FO), significant deflections from zero were observed at the end of movement. For monkey Y, under FP decoding, the mean deflection was −1.64 ± 1.56 mm (t(10) = −3.48, p = 0.006); under FO, −1.85 ± 2.25 mm (t(39) = −5.20, p < 0.001). For monkey Z, under FP decoding, deflection was −10.90 ± 2.87 mm (t(4) = −8.49, p = 0.001); under FO, −5.18 ± 5.08 mm (t(4) = −12.37, p = 0.0001). These results indicate a motor-like encoding during adaptation, qualitatively similar to M1-PMd (Fig 4C). Even when PRR was not contributing to the control of the decoder, an equivalent pattern of adaptation was observed, indicating motor-related changes rather than representation of the visual feedback. For the PRR controlling units, Monkey Y showed a 13% relative gain to the final adaptation, while Monkey Z showed 64%. When PRR was noncontrolling, Monkey Y showed a 14% relative gain, and Monkey Z achieved 37%. In summary, our findings suggest that PRR exhibits substantial motor-like encoding during movement adaptation, even when it is not directly controlling the movement, highlighting its involvement in the adaptation process. This indicates that PRR plays a more integral role in motor adaptation than merely reflecting visual feedback. An important aspect of our study design is to compare movement planning and execution to understand the dynamics of neural adaptation. Specifically, we ask whether motor preparation and the associated initial states of neural dynamics are updated trial-by-trial during adaptation, or if only online motor control changes during BCI learning. The transition between planning and movement phase was comparable in the BCI and MC contexts. We applied a PC decomposition and cross-projected the neural activity during planning onto the dimensions that best explained the activity during movement. We found that the explained variance in the planning activity, when projected into the first four dimensions of the movement subspace, was significantly reduced in comparison to the movement activity (S3 Fig, paired t test, all comparisons p < 0.001. Monkey Y, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.46, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.86, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.87, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.91, t(49). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.67, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.92, t(49); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.88, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.96, t(49). Monkey Z, MC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.53, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.76, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.63, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.74, t(14). BC: M1-PMd meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.62, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.83, t(14); PRR meanₚₗₐₙ = 0.79, meanₘₒᵥ = 0.87, t(14)). The subspace misalignment was more pronounced in frontal areas compared to parietal areas in both monkeys. The alignment patterns were equivalent in both manual and BCI trials. These results show substantial differences between the manifold structure in the planning and movement phases not only in MC but also in BCI. We attribute these change in neural state to a transitions from planning while not attempting cursor movements during the delay period to actually producing a cursor move towards the target during the movement period. If the animals had attempted cursor movements during the delay period of the BCI trials already, the release of the cursor blockade at the end of the delay period would have led to an immediate cursor movement, since neural response modulations directly affect cursor movements in BCI control. Instead, what we observed in BCI trials were neural response latencies from the go cue that were similar to, or even longer than those during manual reaches (animal Y: MC activity peak 259.55 ± 31.58 ms versus BCI 255.05 ± 29.09 ms; animal Z: MC activity peak 353.05 ± 43.13 ms versus BCI 463.72 ± 43.86 ms; see S3I Fig). To better understand how the FP network adjusts to altered feedback, we examined changes not just during the control of movement but also during its planning phase. To measure neural changes during planning, we employed an offline decoder approach similar to the one used for studying the movement phase. For planning, similar to movement decoding, we trained the decoder with baseline trials but used neural activity from the memory period. Unlike movement decoding, this training involved regressing the firing rates against a directional vector that continuously pointed to the cued target. Decoding the direction every 50 ms enabled us to reconstruct hypothetical 3D trajectories offline during the planning phase. For each target direction, we took the 400 ms time interval before the ‘go’ cue. We then calculated the vector sum of the individual unit vectors, each pointing in the direction decoded within that specific time bin (Fig 5A). The hypothetical trajectories we produced stem from a direct projection of the neural space into the 3D task space through the decoder, reflecting the intended direction during planning. In essence, these trajectories transform neural activity into a space where variations are explicitly linked to the task space (via the decoder), such as aiming at a target. To validate our decoding methodology during the planning phase, we identified the intended targets by determining the closest target to the final position attained at the conclusion of the planning phase for each reconstructed trajectory within the task space (using an 8-way discrete classifier). In our baseline trials, the decoder produced hypothetical trajectories in the task space that were consistent with the intended target (S5 Fig). (A) Schematic illustration of the offline decoding principle during the memory period. As previously described for movement decoding, a velocity Kalman filter decoder was applied to reconstruct theoretical memory trajectories from neural activity (first column). During the memory period, a unity vector always pointing at the target was used for regression with neural firing rates (second column, training set). After calibration during baseline trials, the decoder was used to reconstruct continuous trajectories during perturbation trials (third column). The example averaged trajectories demonstrate continuous movements toward the target. In the last column, the reconstructed 3D trajectory from the offline decoder is projected onto the perturbation plane for perturbation trials. These projections assess visual-like or motor-like encoding, where positive deviations along this axis correspond to the visual signal, and negative deflections indicate motor output during adaptation. (B) The reconstructed trajectories in the perturbed dimension exhibit a negative deflection, indicating re-aiming, even during the planning period. At the end of the trajectory, a box plot compares all M1-PMd neurons with zero. The whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentiles. Numerical data are available in S4 Data.

Numerical data are available in S4 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.g005 Equivalent to the analyses during movement, we tested the decoder’s generalization to quantify adaptation and its spatial frame of reference. This was done by training it during the memory phase of the baseline trials and then applying it during the memory phase of the rotation trials. Much like neural activity observed during movement, any deviations in the reconstructed hypothetical trajectories (once projected onto the perturbation direction) would suggest either motor- or visual-like adaptation. We quantified this in a manner equivalent to how we assessed data during movement control (Fig 5A, right side). For both monkeys, the controlling and noncontrolling units in the M1-PMd regions exhibited motor-like adaptation during the planning phase. This demonstrates the use of a re-association strategy in a motor-reference frame during motor planning (Fig 5B). In the PRR, re-association in a motor-reference frame during planning could also be observed. Differences were statistically significant for the individual monkeys in either only the controlling units (monkey Y) or in the noncontrolling units (monkey Z) with nonsignificant trends in the respective other group of neurons (S6 Fig). By extracting the re-associated movement directions in both the planning and movement periods, we tested whether the observed level of trial-by-trial adaptation during planning predicts the adaptation levels during movement. We correlated the deviations of the decoded trajectories from a direct-to-target trajectory towards the end of the planning period (400 ms before go cue) with the deviations observed during movement 200 ms after the go cue for each trial (Fig 6A). We chose the early 200 ms deflection in the movement to reduce the impact of feedback-driven online corrections, which would be anticipated at later intervals. A positive correlation would support the hypothesis that adaptation is mostly achieved by adapting the initial conditions prior to the onset of movement, while movement-associated neural dynamics remain comparably stable. It’s important to note that trajectories in the task space are theoretical during the planning phase and are decoded differently (see Materials and methods) than during the movement phase. Therefore, the regression slope between the planning and the movement trajectories is in arbitrary units. However, relative values in the slope across brain regions, different neuronal groups, or between the initial and advanced stages of adaptation can still signify the ratio at which changes related to adaptation during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. (A) Schematic representation of the analysis method. The reconstructed trajectories at the end of the planning period were regressed against those at 200 ms into the movement phase to test if adaptation levels during planning correlate with those during movement. For each axis, they represent the values assumed for each trial along the perturbation dimension in the specific period (planning and movement). (B) Multi-comparison of regression slopes for all controlling and noncontrolling populations. The slopes were extracted using a multiple linear regression model from data collected from two animals, with random factors considered. Paired multiple comparisons were deemed significant for an interaction effect between the two tested populations with a Bonferroni-corrected p-value < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). The error bars indicate 95% Bonferroni-corrected bootstrapped confidence intervals as estimated by the model. (C) Graphical representation of learning-related changes in slope.

This model incorporates the trial number (perturbation trials) as an interaction factor to examine if the relationship evolves during adaptation. We applied a combined model, accounting for both animals, with the individual animal as a random factor and the day of the experiment nested within the animal random factor. Additionally, we separated the analysis for different brain areas and further categorized it based on controlling and noncontrolling units. Significant correlations were observed between deflections during planning and movement across all brain areas, but not all subgroups of neurons (Fig 6B). For controlling and noncontrolling M1-PMd populations, slopes were significant (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0085, respectively), indicating correlations. Similarly, for PRR noncontrolling units, a significant correlation was observed (p < 0.001). For PRR controlling units, such a relationship was not evident (p = 0.30). When we compared the slope values across all controlling and noncontrolling populations in the absence of the interaction parameter, we noticed a significant difference in every comparison (Fig 6B). The linear relationship between planning and movement was already apparent during the baseline BCI trials and, though less pronounced, also during the MC trials (S7 Fig). The fact that neural states during late planning and initial movement are correlated indicates that adaptation-induced changes during planning manifest as dynamic changes during movement. We next ask if this relationship remains unchanged over the course of learning, implying a stable relationship between initial state before movement and consecutive motor-related dynamics, or if the relationship evolves as learning progresses, implying a dynamic interplay changing the “gain” with which neural adaptations during planning are linked to changes in movement execution. The regression slope changes for both controlling and noncontrolling neural populations in PMd-M1, as well as in the noncontrolling population of PRR (Fig 6C shows the first half of the trials versus the second half of the trials). This change is indicated by a significant interaction of correlation strength with trial number in our model (for M1-PMd controlling p_change_slope < 0.001, for M1-PMd noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.0053, for PRR noncontrolling p_change_slope = 0.023, for PRR controlling p_change_slope = 0.4. This suggests that, over time, the same degree of neural adaptation during the planning phase results in more pronounced motor corrections (interaction M1-PMd controlling: 0.000223, interaction M1-PMd noncontrolling: 0.00010. At the same time this translates in the opposite effect in PRR noncontrolling (interaction effect: −0.00010). Previous studies on motor learning in primates have predominantly focused on the motor cortex in 2D settings [11,22,23,47,56,58]. Here, we investigated the adaptive mechanisms underlying short-term adaptation in a distributed network involving both frontal and parietal sensorimotor areas. By employing a VMR task in 3D movements, we explored motor adaptation and the associated neural dynamics with the same dimensionality as natural movements [69], reducing physical constraints. To minimize potential confounds arising from changes in cross-modal congruency due to the applied perturbation, we employed a BCI paradigm which removes movement-contingent proprioceptive feedback. By selectively manipulating the remaining task-relevant visual feedback and exclusively controlling movements through observed neurons feeding into the BCI decoder, we gained precise control over the sensorimotor loop and associated transformations [16,17]. Furthermore, we utilized memory-guided reaches to examine how motor planning activity and its relationship to movement are influenced by learning in both frontal and parietal sensorimotor regions. Our findings revealed coherent neural adaptation in a motor-reference frame across both frontal and parietal motor areas, i.e., including the parietal region remote from the frontal neurons controlling the BCI. This adaptation was observed in both planning- and movement-related activity, regardless of whether the neurons controlled BCI movements or not. Our results suggest the presence of a distributed mechanism of “re-association” which is happening in a motor-reference frame and influences initial states of movement associated neural dynamics during movement-planning already, both in frontal and parietal cortices. A key finding of our study on BCI-VMR is that even neurons in the PRR area exhibit changes in neural activity during adaptation. Notably, this change is evident even though PRR neurons do not directly govern BCI movements and are remote from the controlling units in PMd-M1. By maintaining a consistent physical state (posture) during BCI movements, we ensured that proprioceptive input remained constant. Consequently, sensory changes induced by perturbations were confined to the visual cursor, which was directly and solely managed by the controlling units via the decoder [16]. Therefore, the decoder input represents the motor command, while its output corresponds to the task-relevant sensory feedback. Additionally, using offline decoding, we could analyze the encoding in groups of neurons not involved in online control. Earlier research has highlighted the preservation of covariance and neural manifold structures during short-term BCI learning tasks in the motor cortex’s controlling units [15,20]. We expand this notion by demonstrating that both noncontrolling motor cortex units and PRR units adapt, while preserving their correlation structure (S3 Fig). This within-manifold adaptation suggests that the constraints imposed by the underlying neural circuitry remains relatively unchanged during VMR learning [20,70,71]. Our findings indicate that a correlated network structure is maintained within the widespread frontoparietal sensorimotor cortices during fast BCI adaptation. In this study, we chose to apply a perturbation in the fronto-parallel plane, as we previously found that subjects adapt most easily to visual perturbations of the cursor in this orientation. It remains an open question whether perturbations around other axes, which have been shown to be more difficult to learn in a human VMR study [67], might require more complex changes in neural activity, potentially extending beyond the intrinsic manifold. On the other hand, mixed representations of neural information about reach direction and distance (depth) in posterior parietal cortex [72–74] and also in PMd [75] do not suggest fundamental differences between dimensions. Our findings indicate that noncontrolling M1-PMd and PRR units reflect adaptive changes in the same motor-related spatial frame of reference that controlling units use. In other words, the changes in noncontrolling units predominantly reflect the adapted movement directions that the controlling units have to produce to counteract the feedback perturbation. The uniform encoding of the movement-associated corrective variable across the frontoparietal network may facilitate efficient information exchange within a closed-loop system for motor corrections, especially involving direct PRR engagement [76]. Our results add to previous work in which parietal area 5 was found to encode motor errors, and where electrically stimulating this area generated movements opposite to the PD of the stimulated cells [77], in line with results from motor areas M1 and PMd [78]. The conclusion that PRR generates a signal in the same frame of reference as the motor areas, in our case, is based on the analysis of neural population responses during a motor adaptation task, without a potentially confounding co-varying proprioceptive feedback. In tasks that impose a rule, requiring animals to learn and apply overt, context-specific stimulus-response associations, such as an anti-reach task [79], animals might be able to use an “explicit” strategy and solve context-specific spatial remapping of a target stimulus onto the motor goal by re-associating different neural dynamics with preexisting neural manifolds [36]. A closely related form of rule-based, explicit learning has been documented in discrete BCI experiments in monkeys [18] and humans [21]. Those studies employed a binary classifier to choose one of two targets, with the “cursor” shown only at the start and end of each trial, so continuous movement-contingent feedback was absent. Because the subject must discover and then apply a categorical association, the resulting adaptation may be based on an explicit strategy. The corresponding neural adaptation has been termed intrinsic-variable learning, i.e., re-association that reuses a preexisting neural manifold. Our experiment differs in at least one key aspect. We used a continuous VMR paradigm in which the cursor was visible throughout the reach, providing a moment-by-moment error signal since the feedback deviated from the expected feedback in perturbation trials. Under these circumstances, human psychophysics with classical VMR tasks often suggest primarily implicit recalibration of the visuomotor map [32,67,80,81]. Yet, learning in continuous VMR tasks may also involve a mixture of implicit recalibration and explicit re-aiming strategies [82]. Moreover, explicit processes themselves are not unitary but consist of dissociable strategies that interact with implicit recalibration in flexible ways [83]. The balance between these processes depends strongly on preparation time: explicit re-aiming requires longer preparation intervals, whereas restricting preparation to ~250 ms suppresses its use and yields behavior dominated by implicit adaptation [84,85]. Since our task design included a delay period prior to movement initiation, it may have provided the animals with additional opportunity to engage explicit strategies. Thus, while we interpret the re-association signals we observe across PMd, M1, and PRR as likely reflecting implicit recalibration, we cannot rule out contributions from explicit re-aiming. In either case, our findings reinforce that re-association is a general neural mechanism, expressed not only in rule-based explicit tasks but also in predominantly implicit adaptation contexts such as continuous VMR. In our study, we probed the trial-by-trial adaptation within the frontoparietal network during the movement planning phases. Specifically, we were keen to understand how re-association processes during planning are transferred to the execution of movement. Drawing from dynamical systems theory, we considered the possibility that neural activity during planning could establish the initial conditions, thereby guiding the dynamical system to produce adapted movements without the need for explicit cognitive computation [60] or enhanced restructuring of the network. Our observations revealed linear correlations between trial-by-trial adjustments of planning and movement activity, evident in both controlling and noncontrolling units of frontal motor areas M1-PMd and, less pronounced, in noncontrolling units of PRR. From a dynamical systems perspective, this suggests that the adaptation of initial states to define updated starting conditions for the following dynamic evolution of states during movement might be particularly true for frontal, but less for parietal areas. Additionally, we found an enhancement of this relationship over the learning phase, indicating that changes during planning translated to more pronounced changes in movement in the later adaptation phase. This suggests that not only the motor error was reduced, but also that the adaptive mechanism became more efficient over the course of learning. These findings partly challenge the notion of a linear dynamical system in motor learning, suggesting that the dynamical system itself may undergo changes. However, [86] offer an complementary perspective, proposing that evolving relationships may reflect the brain’s effort to optimize its energetic costs. In this model, efficient control strategies favor selectively targeting dimensions that most impact future motor outcomes, reducing redundant preparatory effort. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed that as learning progressed, adjustments in planning became more effective in driving corrective changes in movement. This shift implies that less extensive re-association during planning could still enable more substantial corrections during movement, aligning with the view that learning serves not only to reduce error but also to refine the efficiency of neural control mechanisms in an energetically optimal way. We conducted a comparative analysis of online and offline decoding, revealing that all neurons, including noncontrolling units, coherently encode a corrective variable during motor control to counteract visuomotor rotations. This re-association mechanism, previously observed in motor areas, supports efficient information transfer in a feedback control-loop [11,15,18,21,28]. Additionally, our results indicate that re-association during planning can predict movement correction, although their relationship varies throughout learning and depends on the area and causal relationship between the area and the BCI movement. During the later stages of adaptation, it appears that less re-association is required during planning to achieve a specific degree of movement adaptation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that generalized adaptation mechanisms operate within a distributed neural network during three-dimensional movements, offering insights into neural manifold structures and motor error correction. By employing a VMR task in a 3D workspace and using a BCI, we captured spatial encoding and motor adaptation without physically constraining movements and independently controlling sensorimotor transformations from proprioceptive feedback. Our findings highlight the critical role of an integrated motor and parietal sensorimotor network in adaptation. Both frontal and parietal regions primarily encode adapted motor commands rather than merely responding to perturbed visual feedback, supporting the re-association hypothesis of VMR learning. Moreover, learning-associated changes occurred not only in neurons controlling the BCI output but also in neurons not directly connected to the BCI, indicating a widespread mechanism of motor adaptation. Finally, neural adaptation manifests in both planning and movement-related activities across the brain, with learning-associated changes in the correlation between these phases. This relationship evolved particularly within frontal areas during learning, suggesting different adaptation trajectories in frontal versus parietal regions. Our results underscore the distributed nature of adaptation within neural networks underlying motor control and highlight the importance of this network in fine-tuning spatial encoding for precise movement correction. All procedures and experiments were authorized by the relevant regional authority (Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit [LAVES]) under the permit numbers 3,392,42502-04-13/1100 and 33.19-42502-04-18/2823, and fully conformed to German law and the European Directive 2010/63/EU governing the use of animals in scientific research. The setup allowed the animals to perform reaching movements in a three-dimensional VR environment [67,87]. The animals were seated in a dark room with two monitors (BenQ XL2720T, 27-inch diagonal, 1920 × 1080 px, 60 Hz refresh rate) positioned on either side (Fig 1A). They looked through two semi-transparent mirrors (75 × 75 mm, 70R/30T, Edmund Optics) angled at 45° relative to the monitors. This created a stereoscopic 3D virtual impression in front of the subjects. The monitors were tilted 30° relative to the horizontal plane so that the workspace was projected below eye level, allowing the animals to perform ergonomic arm movements in front of their body. To optimize the perception of the virtual workspace, the interpupillary distance of the monkeys was measured (Monkey Y = 33.2 mm, Monkey Z = 33.1 mm). The setup software and screen projections were then calibrated to these individual values to minimize discrepancies between the images for the left and right eyes. Eye position was tracked at 2 kHz (EyeLink 1000 Plus, SR Research LTD, Ottawa, Canada), and the gaze was required to be maintained on the central fixation point during the memory period (see below). The custom-written task controller was implemented in C++, allowing simultaneous tracking of multiple interfaces including the BCI, the eye and the hand tracking systems [88]. The BCI was implemented as a Matlab program running an online loop, which communicated with the task controller via a Matlab implementation of the VRPN library through a MEX file [89]. Neural data were not just recorded to hard drives but also processed online through a MEX interface provided by the recording system (Cerebus, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to extract spike counts (see below). The loop operated every 50 ms in consecutive nonoverlapping time windows. During BCI trials, the cursor was automatically placed at the central fixation point during the holding phase and after the movement was completed (see task description below). Four infrared cameras tracked the position of four passive markers centered on the monkey’s palm in real-time (Fig 1A) at 100 Hz. The two animals were trained to wear a 3D-printed plastic framework containing the four reflective markers arranged around the right wrist. The center of geometry of the four markers was tracked using four Vicon Bonita B10 cameras (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and aligned with the midpoint of the palm. To facilitate accurate tracking and control in the VR setup, we performed two calibrations. First, we calibrated the cameras to stream the center of geometry of the markers attached to the monkey’s wrist. We added an extra marker at the position of the monkey’s wrist, which served as the reference point during this calibration. Using Vicon Tracker 1.3.1 software (Vicon), we adjusted the center of geometry of the four markers to align with this additional marker. This allowed the software to stream the position of the center of geometry online to the task controller, ensuring that this position corresponded accurately to the monkey’s wrist position in the physical setup. Second, we calibrated the camera space with the task controller space to ensure proper alignment between the virtual environment and the physical setup. During this calibration, a human operator co-registered the cursor position and the displayed target positions using semi-transparent mirrors. This process translated the coordinates from Vicon space to the task space, allowing the VR system to accurately reflect the monkey’s movements within the task environment.[67]. Two Rhesus monkeys performed a 3D, memory-guided, and center-out reach task (Fig 1B). At the beginning of each trial, during the decoder calibration phase, the animals were required to acquire and maintain a central fixation point with both their hand and gaze for 400 ms (fixation period). Following this, one of eight targets, positioned at the vertices of a 70 mm-sided cube and centered around the fixation point, was briefly displayed for 300 ms (cue period). The animals had to continue holding their hand and gaze at the center of the cube for an additional 400 ms (planning period), followed by a variable delay of up to 600 ms. After the delay, the central fixation target disappeared, signaling the animals to move toward the target (movement period), with a timeout limit of 1,500 ms. During BCI control trials, the cursor movement was controlled by a neural decoder. The task remained identical to the MC task that had been used for calibration. If, at any point, the animals directed their gaze outside a 30 mm tolerance window around the fixation point or moved their hand more than 15 mm from its starting position (security radius) during the fixation period, the trial was aborted. MC trials were employed to calibrate a biomimetic velocity KF decoder, which was subsequently used to perform the BCI trials (Fig 1C, BCI). Once the animals became proficient in controlling the cursor during the BCI task (reaching a baseline of 160 successful trials), we introduced a VMR to perturb the visual cursor feedback. This was implemented by applying a 30° visuomotor rotation of the cursor’s movement in the fronto-parallel plane. The direction of the rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) varied between days, and the perturbation lasted for a variable number of trials with a maximum of 320 trials. Following the perturbation phase, a washout phase was introduced, during which the visuomotor rotation was removed, and the animals returned to controlling the cursor without any rotation for another variable number of trials until they finished their session for the day. Both animals were housed socially with a single male of the same species at the German Primate Center. The enclosure sizes surpassed the standards required by both German and European regulations. They were kept in a setting enriched with wooden structures, toys, and various other enrichment devices. Neuronal activity was recorded from two macaque monkeys implanted with floating microelectrode arrays (FMAs, MicroProbes, Gaithersburg, USA) in three cortical areas: M1, PMd, and PRR. Monkey Y was implanted with two 32-channel FMAs in each area, while monkey Z was implanted with three 32-channel FMAs in PMd and PRR (see S1C Fig). Both animals were implanted in the left hemisphere, contralateral to the arm used for calibrating the BCI decoder and performing the MC task (S1C Fig). Premotor array positions in monkey Z range between 18.2–25.2 mm AP and 10.5–13.5 mm ML (array centers), and in monkey Y between 18.6–19.6 mm AP and 13.1–17.4 mm ML. M1 array positions in monkey Z range between 14.2–17.2 mm AP and 12.5–14.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between 10.3–11.6 mm AP 11.9–16.2 mm ML. Parietal array positions in monkey Z range between −1.3 and −6.8 mm AP and 5.5–10.5 mm ML, and in monkey Y between −0.4 and −4.1 mm AP and 8.1–11.9 mm ML. Position data per each array can be found in S1 Fig. The positioning of the premotor arrays aimed at the arm region of PMd. M1 arrays targeted the arm region along different depth in the anterior wall of the central sulcus. Parietal arrays covered the MIP region of the posterior PRR with the longer electrodes, while the shorter electrodes sample from closer to the surface and may partially include area 5 (also referred to as area PEc). In single-day sessions, we recorded from 128 electrodes simultaneously in monkey Y, while we recorded from all 256 electrodes in monkey Z. Activity was recorded online and stored on a hard drive using a 128-channel Cerebus system (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) for monkey Y and two 128-channel Cerebus systems for monkey Z. Data were sampled at 30 kHz. Signals were band-pass filtered (250 Hz–7.5 kHz), and a threshold of −4.5 times the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage was used to isolate below-threshold waveforms. Before the start of each daily experimental session, manual online sorting was performed by an expert user. Sorting involved identification of clusters in PC space to classify neuronal activity based on waveform characteristics. Online neuronal activity during movement was used to train a velocity KF decoder [90] by regressing neuronal firing rates from a subset of single and multi-units with hand velocity (50 ms steps, nonoverlapping time windows) while the monkey manually performed the task during the movement period. During FO decoding a subset of M1 and PMd units where used while during FP decoding subsets of M1 and PMd units were combined with all PRR units. After an initial MC calibration consisting of about 60 trials for initializing KF parameters, the velocity KF decoder was retrained using velocity vectors that directly pointed toward the target [91]. During retraining, first the computer mostly controlled the cursor movement. The computer’s contribution then was step-by-step progressively reduced until real-time neural activity fully guided the cursor. The transition was managed by applying a weighted vectorial sum of both the computer-generated and neural signals, gradually increasing the brain’s control for smoother cursor operation. This adjustment was performed over successive blocks of 20–30 trials, reducing the computer’s contribution from 70% to 0%. The process was not automated and required expert judgment to determine the appropriate timing of the transitions. Additionally, hand movements greater than 15 mm from the resting position were discouraged to prevent the animal from using its hand during BCI trials. This retraining calibration step was necessary to eliminate hand movement during BCI control. We employed the method described by [28] to average trajectories reaching different targets. In brief, trajectories were first projected onto the plane of the applied perturbation (xy—fronto-parallel plane). For each trajectory to a target, the dimension orthogonal to the direction from the center to the specific target was defined as the “perturbation dimension.” This allowed all trajectories to the eight different targets to be averaged within this common reference frame. The positive sign of this second axis was chosen based on the direction of the applied perturbation (clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the session). The online-sorted spikes were re-sorted offline using Boss software (v.1.0.3, Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, USA) to better isolate and identify additional units among the noncontrolling units. Units used for online decoding were left unchanged. A threshold of −4.5 times the standard deviation of the noise was used to isolate spikes, with a refractory period of 1.5 ms. Clusters were identified using a semi-automated k-means method in PC space. This semi-automated process required the user to specify the number of clusters and define the initial centroid for each. To study changes in the encoded correction variable during adaptation for noncontrolling units, and during the memory period for all units, we applied a KF decoder offline, similar to the one used for online BCI trials, to reconstruct cursor trajectories. The decoder was always trained on the activity from baseline trials and then applied to the activity from the rotated trials to identify the encoded variable during adaptation. For the evaluation of the decoder during baseline trials, a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was used to include all baseline trials in the analysis. Each time point, sampled every 50 ms and containing all the spikes from each neuron, was used as input to the decoder. For the decoder’s training output, real movement speeds were used during the movement epoch (sampled every 50 ms), while a normalized vector pointing to the cued target was used during the planning epochs (also sampled every 50 ms). This approach allowed us to reconstruct theoretical neural trajectories from the decoded speeds during movement for noncontrolling units and during the memory phase for both controlling and noncontrolling units. We calculated the PC space for each analyzed epoch and region, plotting the variance explained by each dimension (S3 Fig), averaged across the dataset. In the cross-projected analysis of S3A, S3C, S3E, and S3G, we computed the PCs during the movement phase, projected the activity from the memory phase onto the seven PCs, and calculated the explained variance in each specific direction (component). For the alignment index calculation in S3B, S3D, S3F, and S3H Fig, we followed the method of Elsayed and colleagues [62], considering the top four PCs in the transformation. In brief, the alignment index measures manifold alignment and is calculated as the ratio between the explained variance of the projected activity (e.g., during the planning phase) along the original dimensions and the explained variance of the original main dimensions (e.g., derived from movement activity). To calculate the original PC space, we used cross-validated baseline trials to ensure that the alignment index reflects genuine differences between baseline and experimental phases, avoiding artifacts from overfitting. Neuronal contributions were computed from the observation matrix, the rows of which contain the weights linking x, y, z speed to the expected firing rate of neuron. We determined the firing rate of a single cell given the direction of movement using the following equation: We calculated the amplitude of the regressing vector (b1, b2, b3), summed to b0, to estimate the single neuron’s contribution to the decoder, as shown in Fig 4A. This measure provides a single scalar that reflects how much leverage the neuron can exert on the decoded cursor state. We used a linear model to test the significance of the relationship between the planning and movement phases in brain each area, separately for the groups of controlling and noncontrolling units. We also included trial number as variable to model slope changes due to learning and tested the interaction between learning and the planning-movement slope. Different experimental sessions and the two animals were treated as random factors in the model, with a nested hierarchical structure. The Wilkinson notation for the modeled variable was as follows: To calculate slope differences between controlling and noncontrolling populations, as well as between different areas, we employed a similar model that incorporated pairwise-tested interaction effects for the areas being compared. All six pairwise comparisons were corrected for significance using the Bonferroni method (see Fig 5B). The corresponding Wilkinson notation was as follows: Experimental design. This table summarizes, for each recording session, the number of units for each population, the type of decoder used, the rotation angle, and the direction of rotation (clockwise, CW, or counterclockwise, CCW). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.s001 (PDF) Hand movement speed and array implantations.

Numerical data are available in S6 Data. (C) Array locations. Monkey Y received six 32-channel floating micro-wire arrays (FMA, MicroProbes for Life Sciences, Gaithersburg, USA) in three distinct brain regions contralateral to the arm used for decoder calibration. Two arrays with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm were implanted in the arm region of the primary motor cortex (M1), two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 4.5 to 2.1 mm in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and two with staggered electrode lengths ranging from 7.1 to 1.9 mm in the parietal reach region (PRR). Similarly, in Monkey Z, three arrays were implanted in PMd, two in M1, and three in PRR. Stereotactic coordinates (AP, ML) in mm along the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral axes are provided in the sketches for each array. All the pictures in the figure were taken by the authors. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.s002 (EPS) Alignment index during task epochs. Alignment indexes (AI) during various task epochs for planning (left) and movement (right) phases were calculated. The AI was determined by projecting the neural activity from both the early and late adaptation phases onto the principal components (PCs) derived from baseline activity. We selected a sufficient number of PCs to explain 90% of the baseline variance. AI during the baseline was computed using cross-validation. Notably, AI exhibited minimal variation between the baseline and visuomotor rotation (VMR) phases, indicating the preservation of neural manifolds throughout the learning process. Numerical data are available in S7 Data. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003408.s003 (EPS) Neural manifold comparison between MC and BCI.

Today’s top news: The world’s second-largest asset manager is considering letting its U.S. clients buy crypto ETFs. The final walls are falling down. Last week, Crypto in America reported that Vanguard is weighing access to select spot crypto ETFs for brokerage customers. This is a sharp departure from its 2024 stance, when it blocked spot Bitcoin ETFs on-platform. There’s no final decision or product list yet; the discussions reflect persistent client demand and the competitive reality that most major peers already enable trading. Notably, Vanguard’s CEO Salim Ramji was previously at BlackRock and oversaw the launch of their Bitcoin ETF IBIT, one of the most successful ETF launches of all time. For asset context, Vanguard today oversees ~$10T in AUM and serves more than 50 million investors globally, so even a cautious rollout would be consequential for ETF liquidity. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024.” - source talking to Crypto in America “Vanguard, the 2nd largest asset manager in the world, is finally planning to allow clients to invest in crypto ETFs on their platform. By waiting this long, they have “protected” clients from +150% gains on $BTC since the ETFs went live.” - Satoshi Stacker on X If Vanguard enables crypto ETF access, even with tight guardrails, it adds a massive set of ongoing inflows into crypto majors. That means deeper secondary-market liquidity, broader retirement-account penetration, and more “default” exposure from set-it-and-forget-it investors who previously had to move assets elsewhere. Just 1% of $11T is $110B in inflows (and likely a major up-front portfolio rebalance adjustment). That’s massive. It also marks a symbolic validation: the firm that once said “not appropriate for long-term portfolios” would be acknowledging a durable role for crypto alongside stocks and bonds. The final holdouts are starting to capitulate. The crypto boom cycle is about to begin… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the week: Section dedicated to headlines in the AI sector of crypto: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.
