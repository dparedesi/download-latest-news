Nadella tells Davos that AI’s legitimacy hinges on making people's lives better When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is concerned that if artificial intelligence doesn’t start delivering real, measurable benefits to society, people will be fed up with it and its price, ending its current form of existence. The Davos stage is an odd venue and audience to preach societal good over other goods, but it certainly helped his comments stand out. AI developers "have to get to a point where we are using this to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries. Otherwise, I don't think this makes much sense," Nadella explained during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "We will quickly lose even the social permission to take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness, across all sectors, small and large." The Davos crowd, used to a more digital transformation cheerleading role, sounded a little confused. But the discussion also shows how the AI hype train is both an illusion and real. Nadella should know what he's talking about. Microsoft is one of the biggest drivers of the current AI boom, with tens of billions of dollars invested in OpenAI, its own Copilot suite baked into productivity tools, and a seat at nearly every major AI policy table. But his message at Davos was that leadership now demands a reckoning – not just about how smart or useful AI tools are in theory, but whether they’re helping people in schools, clinics, small businesses, and city governments. That’s not an abstract moral argument. It’s an infrastructure one. AI’s growth has been driven by immense computational muscle, which means it’s also driven by massive energy use. Training today's biggest models consumes as much electricity as some small countries consume in a year. And inference, when you run the model on your phone or desktop to answer a question or generate a response, adds to that cost every second it runs. AI doesn’t just use servers; it fuels an ever-expanding footprint of data centers, water-cooled systems, and grid-straining workloads. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Nadella’s social permission phrase gets to the heart of what might be next. Until now, the public has broadly accepted that cloud-based tech companies can use resources in exchange for productivity, entertainment, or convenience. But that goodwill isn’t guaranteed. If AI begins to look like a wasteful luxury, delivering novelty rather than necessity, citizens and governments may start to push back. During the session, Larry Fink asked whether all this productivity talk would mean fewer jobs, and Nadella didn’t dismiss the concern. But he argued that AI’s potential lies in amplifying what people can do. But this moment is different from past tech inflection points. The sheer scale of AI's appetite. Cloud computing scaled gradually. Smartphones had physical limits. But AI can grow as fast as the models and capital behind it allow. That’s why Nadella’s call to focus on outcomes comes off as cautious as well as pragmatic. Nadella’s message was simple but sharp: we are nearing the edge of public tolerance for black-box systems powered by opaque amounts of energy, with unclear societal benefits. And maybe we should all be asking harder questions when the next shiny AI tool drops: Does this help me? Does it help someone? Or is it just burning energy to generate yet another token?

Title: India’s wealth boom sparks M&A frenzy as banks chase affluent clients

MUMBAI: India’s wealth management industry is scrambling to scale as a growing pool of household financial wealth remains underserved. Of the at least $1.1 trillion held by the country’s top households, defined as those with annual incomes of $25,000 or more, at the end of FY24, only about $0.7 trillion was addressed by registered wealth managers, according to a 2025 Deloitte report. This leaves an estimated $0.4 trillion in unmet demand. This pool of household wealth is being serviced by a limited universe of private wealth managers, financial advisers, mutual fund distributors and registered investment advisers. Specialized wealth managers are only able to meet 11% of the demands of the country's top 1% households, as per a Bernstein report from 2025. These include listed platforms like 360 One Wealth, Anand Rathi Wealth, Nuvama Wealth, as well as private players like Kotak Wealth, Julius Baer India. Waterfield Advisors, and Avendus Wealth. Most high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth demand, Bernstein noted, remains either self-managed, handled by accountants, or serviced by domestic banks and brokers offering limited customization, as well as independent advisers that lack scale. The imbalance has turned wealth management into one of the country’s most active dealmaking sectors, drawing global banks, foreign asset managers and domestic lenders eager to secure access to India’s affluent and ultra-high-net-worth clients. “The velocity at which investable capital is forming in India has surpassed the speed at which many institutions can build organic advisory capability," said Feroze Azeez, joint CEO of Anand Rathi Wealth. The scarcity of established platforms, he said, is drawing foreign capital seeking direct access to Indian wealth while pushing domestic banks to race for specialized capabilities. India is now among the world’s fastest-growing wealth markets, with wealth creation accelerating across entrepreneurs, professionals and salaried classes, said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO of IIFL Capital. “This expanding client base demands personalized investment advisory services…Those rare firms offering all services are in focus." The opportunity is only expected to widen. Bernstein estimates that the country’s serviceable wealth is expected to triple from $3 trillion in FY25 to $9 trillion by FY35. Firms race for scaleSeveral international and domestic banks, and asset managers are moving quickly to capture a share of this growth. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Emirates NBD Bank, which recently received Reserve Bank of India approval to set up wholly owned subsidiaries, are still deciding whether to build organically or acquire existing platforms, according to two people aware of the matter. Jefferies is also looking to enter India’s mutual fund space through an organic buildout, a third person said. SMBC, Emirates NBD did not respond to emailed queries, while a Jefferies spokesperson refused to comment. Domestic players are also reassessing growth strategies. Mint reported earlier this month that investment bank DAM Capital is preparing for a potential foray into wealth management and alternative investment funds. Some deals are already delivering shortcuts to scale. Boston-based State Street Corp. recently invested ₹580 crore in fintech platform Groww’s asset management business. Last month, Mizuho Financial Group agreed to acquire KKR’s majority stake in Avendus Capital, giving the Japanese lender immediate access to the firm’s ultra-high-net-worth client relationships. Deutsche Bank AG’s India retail and wealth management business, valued at $2.5 billion, has reportedly drawn binding bids from Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Federal Bank Ltd. Affluence fuels the rushThe primary driver of this deal activity is the rise of India's affluent class, industry experts explained. They said that the number of high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals in India has surged in recent years, fuelling demand for sophisticated wealth management services. In 2025, India had four of the top 10 cities globally for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, according to wealth intelligence firm Altrata – the financial hub of Mumbai; Bengaluru and Hyderabad, centres for IT and business services; and the national capital, Delhi. The Mercedes-Benz Hurun India Wealth Report 2025 noted nearly a 200% rise in India’s millionaire households. It estimated that India now has 871,700 households with net worth above ₹8.5 crore, or approximately $1 million, almost double the 2021 figure of 458,000, representing 0.31% of all households. Between 2017 and 2025, million-dollar households grew 45%, though only a small share entered ultra-rich categories. The report also found that 83% of respondents remained confident about India’s economic growth over the next three years. The surge in India mirrors a global trend. In 2025, M&A targeting investment and wealth management firms surged as firms repositioned for rising demand in alternatives and a multi-trillion-dollar generational wealth transfer, with deal volumes at record highs globally. As per Deloitte 2026 Investment Management Outlook report, deal volume in the first half of 2025 jumped 46% year-on-year, making it the most active first half in more than a decade. As in 2023, a substantial share of these transactions targeted wealth management and investment advisory firms. “The continued expansion of alternative investment offerings helps underscore the vital role wealth management firms can play in helping high-net-worth individuals and retail investors make informed investment decisions," the same report said. “Additionally, with trillions of dollars set to shift between generations over the coming decades, many investment firms are taking notice and positioning themselves accordingly." India’s current wave of deals builds on a key consolidation in early 2025, when 360 ONE WAM Ltd acquired UBS Group AG’s onshore India wealth management business, consolidating roughly 80 family office relationships alongside its assets under management. UBS retained a minority stake rather than continuing independently.

BlackRock Inc., which ended its DSP partnership in 2018, re-entered in 2023 through a joint venture with Jio Financial Services Ltd, with chairman Larry Fink calling it a “major step" in expanding the firm’s global presence. Jio BlackRock received final registration and approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India to begin operations in May 2025. Looking ahead, the trend shows no signs of slowing. Deloitte expects continued consolidation through 2026, driven by the integration of public and private market products and competition for scarce wealth-management scale.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG PublishedÂ Jan 22, 2026, 07:42 AM UpdatedÂ Jan 22, 2026, 08:01 PM DAVOS, Switzerland - As artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to upend job markets in countries around the world, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang brushed off longer-term concerns and made the case that skilled vocational workers are seeing increasing demand now. Plumbers, electricians and construction workers are going to be able to command âsix-figure salariesâ, thanks to demand to build data centres that run and train AI, he said in an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21. The technology will require one of the biggest infrastructure build-outs in history, with trillions of dollars in new investment, Mr Huang said. âWeâre seeing quite a significant boom in this area. Salaries have gone up nearly double,â he said. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You donât need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â Mr Huangâs comments echo remarks made at Davos on Jan 20 by Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp, who praised workers with âvocational trainingâ and said AI would create more local jobs and largely eliminate the need for mass immigration. Coreweave CEO Michael Intrator also touched on the âphysicalityâ of the AI boom at a panel later on Jan 21, describing the need for growing numbers of plumbers, electricians and carpenters.Â Nvidia, the leading maker of chips that help power and run the latest AI models, has benefited from the huge rush to build data centres. The company is on track to generate almost US$200 billion (S$256.7 billion) in data centre chip sales for 2025, according to an average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. To date, the bulk of its revenue comes from the biggest data centre builders â Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, Alphabet â but it is striking deals with a growing number of smaller data centre operators. Tech firms have committed to spending a combined US$500 billion in data centre leases in the coming years. AIâs impact on the job market is already being felt. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned about a âwhite-collar bloodbathâ that could wipe out 50 per cent of entry-level jobs. The companyâs Claude AI is gaining attention for its coding abilities, a feature that could displace more junior programmers.Â âWeâre entering a world where the (tasks of) junior-level software engineers â maybe many of the tasks of the more senior-level software engineers â are starting to be done most of the way by AI systems. Now thatâs going to go further,â Mr Amodei said in an interview at Davos on Jan 20. While he believes the good from the technology will outweigh the bad, high unemployment and underemployment are risks that need to be mitigated.Â âThereâs going to be unfortunately a whole class of people who are, across a lot of industries, going to have a hard time coping,â he said.Â On Jan 21, Mr Fink noticeably avoided probing Mr Huang on sensitive topics, most notably China. Nvidiaâs sales to the country are controversial, and the company is waiting to hear whether it will be able to sell its chips to the country and in what quantities. Just on Jan 20, Mr Amodei likened shipping Nvidia chips into China to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.Â Mr Huang is expected to visit China at the end of January as he works to reopen a crucial market for the companyâs AI chips. It is a pivotal time for the business, after the United States moved to ease limits on chip exports to China which it has had in place since 2022. Nvidia is still blocked from shipping the top-of-the-line chips to the country, stymieing Beijingâs ability to innovate beyond the cutting-edge of AI, but will be able to ship older-generation H200 AI chips. China, meanwhile, is expected to clear H200 imports for commercial use in the first three months of 2026, though it will not allow the chips for use in the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure or its state-owned enterprises, Bloomberg News reported. Some of the countryâs most prominent tech firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, have privately expressed interest in ordering more than 200,000 units each of the chip.Â BLOOMBERG Nvidia AI/artificial intelligence Employment E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Pondering whether Ethereum could become the “toll road” to blockchain-based markets, the report stated that Ethereum “could be poised to benefit” from a shift spurring moves across legacy financial institutions, from DTCC to the New York Stock Exchange. Ethereum currently underpins 65% of tokenized assets, according to the report. Meanwhile, the adoption of stablecoins is outpacing spot crypto trading volumes, suggesting that “tokenized assets may have a use-case outside of purely speculative trading.” The second-largest digital asset by market cap has the potential to accrue value if a growing number of firms tap Ethereum for creating digital representations of real-world assets, according to Jay Jacobs, U.S. Head of Equity ETFs at BlackRock. He authored the report. “If we see more tokenized assets utilizing the Ethereum blockchain, ultimately, you would see it be a beneficiary of additional trading activity, [and the] issuance of things like stablecoins or real- world assets,” Jacobs told Decrypt. “If you’re an investor looking to play the growing adoption of blockchain technology, one of the best and probably fastest-growing use cases right now is tokenization, and Ethereum is a beneficiary of that trend,” he added. Although a pie chart included in the report references 10 networks capable of supporting tokenized assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only ones that are mentioned elsewhere, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager has a distinct view toward them. The report didn’t include assets tokenized on Canton Network either. The permissioned blockchain, which was recently tapped by DTCC for its tokenization pilot, is currently used as a record-keeping layer for $362 billion in real-world assets, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum, meanwhile, supports $13.2 billion in real-world assets that can be managed in-wallet. When it comes to BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, the $1.6 billion product primarily exists on Ethereum ($499 million) and Binance’s BNB Chain ($503 million). Broadly, Jacobs said there’s a lot of interest in what BlackRock is calling “the convergence,” where traditional markets are becoming increasingly interconnected with crypto. He pointed to spot exchange-traded funds for digital assets as an example. BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $70.6 billion and $10.7 billion in assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass. The firm has stood by as competitors have created products for other digital assets like XRP and Solana. “You have traditional securities and assets that are looking to be tokenized, and frankly, you have [digital] assets that [...] are making their way into the more traditional financial systems,” he said. “We believe in that convergence that does seem to be accelerating.” Still, Jacobs said that there are plenty of pieces that need to fall into place, whether that’s regulatory policy or company-level policy. Last year, the SEC created a task force to develop a “comprehensive and clear” regulatory framework for digital assets, but the expected passage of a market structure bill could also shape the regulator’s treatment of tokenized assets. What’s more, if firms want to take advantage of capabilities like around-the-clock trading or instant settlement through tokenization—qualities that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink first highlighted in 2022—then Jacobs said there would need to be the development of a supportive market around the technology across a variety of assets. “It’s early,” he said. “There's a lot of interest across financial firms to support this convergence right now, but not all innovation happens in a straight line—and ultimately, you need to see the benefits of tokenization materialized for the investors and trading community.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

By Ireland Owens, Daily Caller News Foundation January 21, 2026 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was heckled by former Vice President Al Gore during a World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, according to news coverage. Gore booed Lutnick while the Commerce secretary was giving a speech at an invite-only dinner event hosted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Mediaite reported on Wednesday. The report comes after Lutnick criticized Europe during his remarks, which prompted European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde to suddenly leave the dinner event, multiple outlets reported. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” Gore said Wednesday in a statement provided to Mediaite. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way.

The WEF and a representative for Gore each did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment. “During Secretary Lutnick’s three-minute speech, no one left hastily,” a Commerce Department spokesperson told the DCNF in a statement on Wednesday. “Only one person booed, and it was Al Gore.” Moreover, Fox Business Network Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote in a Wednesday X post that he was told by a “reliable” anonymous source that “at the dinner Lagarde walked out BEFORE [Lutnick’s] speech and was tired like everyone is at Davos.” Lutnick claimed in an op-ed published by the Financial Times on Tuesday that the Trump administration was “not going to Davos to uphold the status quo,” but instead was going “to confront it head-on.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” Lutnick wrote. “Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind.” Gore suggested Wednesday that U.S. government policy should promote “regenerative agriculture” during a panel discussion at the WEF. Gore added that the U.S. needs “policies that [are] in recognition of the fact that governments around the world typically do subsidize farming, but don’t subsidize them in ways that incentivize them to go in the wrong direction, but incentivize them to go in the right direction.” Gore, the failed 2000 Democratic presidential nominee, is the cofounder and chairman of Generation Investment Management, and also the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a nonprofit organization which aims to combat the “climate crisis,” according to a biography on his website.

Former Vice President Al Gore briefly accosted Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after the Trump official’s speech on the sidelines of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, The Post has learned. During a Tuesday VIP dinner hosted by billionaire BlackRock boss Larry Fink, where several hundred people were invited, Lutnick delivered a speech that was fiercely critical of European allies. When he stepped offstage, Gore walked up to him and said, “Boo” — like he was trying to scare him, a source told The Post. Lutnick laughed and someone at the event remarked, “What an honor to have Al Gore boo,” according to an insider. The ex-veep confirmed he’d disliked the speech. “I sat and listened to his remarks,” the avid environmentalist told The Post in a statement. “I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” According to media reports, a number of other crowd members booed while attendees including European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde left the dinner before dessert was served. Fink reportedly tried to calm the audience as guests made for the exits. But a Commerce Department spokesperson and a BlackRock exec said Lagarde actually left before the remarks. “No one left hastily. Only one person booed and it was Al Gore,” a Commerce rep told The Post. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email.

Lagarde reportedly made a dash for the door as Lutnick argued that Europe was losing global influence — adding to tensions as President Trump ramped up his threats to take over Greenland. Just a day before the speech, the commerce secretary wrote a bold opinion piece for the Financial Times, stating: “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town.” “For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world,” he wrote.

Institutional investors and crypto whales viewed the ETH price drop below $3,000 as a buying opportunity, but data still hints at a deeper sell-off to $2,700. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ether (ETH) price saw a daily candle close below $3,000 on Tuesday, but a positive is that data showed large holders were buying throughout the dip. While ETH whale accumulation signals growing confidence, conflicting indicators suggest rising market risk for the altcoin. Key takeaways: ETH whales and institutional investors bought over $130 million in Ether as the price closed below $3,000 on Tuesday. BitMine added more than 92,500 ETH in January, showcasing the growing demand for staking yield. ETH dropped 7.83% to $2,938 on Tuesday, marking its largest daily correction since November 4, 2025. Despite the drop, onchain tracker Lookonchain reported ETH accumulation from whales and institutional investors. According to the data, Trend Research borrowed 70 million USDt (USDT) from Aave to buy 24,555 ETH worth $75.5 million, bringing its total holdings to 651,310 ETH valued at $1.92 billion. Separately, an OTC whale address acquired 20,000 ETH, worth $58.8 million, via FalconX and Wintermute. Institutional investor accumulation of ETH extended beyond trading desks. BitMine has added 92,511 ETH in January, valued at $268 million. The ETH treasury company said it expects to become the largest Ethereum staking entity once its planned 4.2 million ETH is fully staked, generating an estimated $367 million to $393 million annually in staking rewards. The company added that it projects another $35 million to $40 million in income from cash operations. However, not all large capital flows were supportive. On Wednesday, BlackRock transferred 30,828 ETH worth about $91 million to Coinbase Prime, fueling concerns over potential sell-side volatility. Related: ETH derivatives metric turns positive after years of sell-side dominance From a technical standpoint, ETH’s longer-term chart suffered a bearish shift after closing below $3,000. The move also pushed the price below the four-month point of control near $3,100, the level where the highest volume traded over that period, signaling that the market has lost its most accepted price range. The breakdown coincided with a bearish break of structure (BOS), suggesting trend continuation to the downside. Based on current liquidity clusters, ETH could eventually test external liquidity zones around $2,718 and $2,620. Over the past 24 hours, $287 million in leveraged positions were liquidated, with longs accounting for $257 million, highlighting forced selling pressure. Data from Hyblock adds to the cautious mood. The whale versus retail delta has flipped negative, falling to -6,480 for ETH, indicating that whales are reducing their long exposure or adding shorts more aggressively than retail traders. Such shifts have preceded periods of heightened short-term volatility. On the other hand, 76% of retail traders are in long positions, pointing to the potential for a price reversal near the key swing lows.

Title: Palantir CEO: AI Technology Reduces the Need for Skilled Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/21/palantir-ceo-ai-technology-reduces-the-need-for-skilled-migration/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T20:26:34Z
Full Content:
There is little need for large-scale migration into U.S. jobs while Americans’ productivity is being turbocharged by artificial intelligence, according to Alex Karp, CEO of the fast-growing Palantir Technologies. “I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill,” Karp told an elite audience at the 2026 World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. The technology will replace many white-collar jobs, he said, adding, “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.” The statement is good news for the millions of American college graduates who have been pushed out of careers and prosperity by a huge inflow of mostly Indian H-1B visa workers. The imported visa workforce has been used to sideline outspoken American professionals and to create a backroom economy of kickbacks that enriches U.S. and Indian managers, chokes innovation, and defrauds stockholders. Clever people will prosper even as the AI technology performs more white-collar tasks, Karp said: The person managing our Maven [intelligence] system in the U.S. Army is a former police officer who I think, went to a junior college. They’re doing very, very high-end, very complicated targeting globally, and that person actually is irreplaceable. I think in the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person’s talents are — and would [that person] have been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Overall, the AI technology will help well-managed communities, he said. “America and China… work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible,” said Karp. Worldwide, he said, “I would imagine… you’re just going to find pockets that go very well and pockets that go very poorly.” President Donald Trump echoes the technology-beats-migration theme in some of his speeches as he zig-zags between his business allies and his populist base. For example, in his January 21 speech at the Davos conference, he said: Our previously open and dangerous border is closed and virtually impenetrable, and the United States is in the midst of the fastest and most dramatic economic turnaround in our country’s history. Under the Biden administration, America was plagued by the nightmare of stagflation, meaning low growth and high inflation, a recipe for misery, failure, and decline. But now, after just one year of my policies, we’re witnessing these opposite — virtually no inflation at extraordinarily high economic growth. Many tech leaders say the fast-evolving AI technology will sweep away many traditional jobs in software, media, and other sectors. This technological revolution is allowing tech-sector CEOs to speak out against mass migration. For example, Elon Musk has also escalated his criticism of mass unskilled migration: “We cannot let [illegal migrants] stay… [because] democracy is the real issue,” said Palmer Lucky, the founder of Anduril Industries, a defense company: There is an effectively unlimited supply of poor people from poor countries that want to live in the United States who can be used to fuel this [Democratic political] strategy. Some [migrants] might be net positive to the US economy, some might not be, but that is beside the point — all [migrants] would equally contribute to a future where [the] minority rules the majority [with migrant votes] with no recourse. The new skepticism among CEOs about migration also comes amid the rising influence of Islam in the West, such as the election of Zohran Mamdani to the mayorship of New York. The pressure is swaying some influential CEOs against migration. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder and 2026 Davos chief Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology… If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. [Emphasis added.] Other CEOs argue that AI will create labor shortages. Progressive demands for power and cash are also pushing tech leaders away from migration advocacy and toward compromises with the GOP’s base of American voters. For example, California investor Jason Calacanis posted on January 20: tech was historically 85 percent+ “socially-liberal moderates partnered with democrats” and 15 percent *quietly* republican In 2026, it’s flipped with ~70 percent of folks are now “social-liberal moderates partnered with republicans.” The socially-liberal moderates are the majority, and the democrats pushed these folks out of the party with the DEI, ESG, socialist, and “deranged woke” ideologies. Founders/tech just want to work, pay their taxes, be left alone to build and have a seat at the table on the margins. Meanwhile, many progressives and their migrant allies are pushing for more migration. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2026 Breitbart

As 40-year yields skyrocket past 4%, the sudden evaporation of cheap yen is forcing a messy global reset. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. At first glance, this looks like a story that lives on the back pages of a newspaper, Japanese government bonds with maturities that run so long they sound like a joke, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. If you own Bitcoin, you still end up in the blast radius. Because when Japan’s long-dated bonds start to wobble, it is rarely just about Japan. It is about the world’s last big source of cheap money slowly turning into something more expensive, and what happens to every trade that quietly depended on that cheap funding. Japan has spent most of the last few decades as the place where money was close to free. That shaped global markets in a thousand small ways, even if you never bought a Japanese bond in your life. Now that era is fading. In December, the Bank of Japan lifted its benchmark rate to 0.75%, the highest level in roughly 30 years, part of a broader shift away from ultra-low policy that defined the country’s post-1990s playbook. That move matters because Japan is not a small player. It is a funding hub. It is a reference point. It is the place global investors could point to when they wanted to borrow cheaply, hedge later, and hunt for returns somewhere else. When that cheap anchor starts lifting, markets adjust, sometimes gently, sometimes all at once. With the BOJ letting rates run to levels not seen in decades, the structural "term premium" is rising, a direct headwind for long-duration crypto exposure. The fresh red flag is coming from the far end of Japan’s yield curve, the super-long bonds. Japan’s 40-year government bond yield pushed above 4% for the first time, hitting around 4.2% as selling pressure built, and a recent 20-year auction showed weaker demand with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.19, below its 12-month average. Even if you do not live in bond world, that is the kind of detail traders circle with a thick marker. Auctions are where the market reveals how much real appetite exists for the debt being issued. When demand starts slipping at the long end, investors start asking harder questions about who the marginal buyer is going forward, and how much yield Japan will have to offer to keep funding itself smoothly. A second datapoint makes the shift feel less like a blip. Japan’s 30 year government bond yield has climbed to about 3.46%, up sharply from about 2.32% a year earlier. This is what a regime change looks like in slow motion, one auction, one basis point, one nervous headline at a time. Thin order books met hard macro triggers and the market snapped as it entered December. Crypto loves to tell stories about being outside the system. The price still lives inside the system. When rates rise, especially long-term rates, the entire market has to rethink what tomorrow’s cash is worth today. Higher yields raise the bar for every risky bet, stocks, private credit, venture, and yes, Bitcoin. BlackRock put it bluntly in a recent note on crypto volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown sensitivity to USD real rates, similar to gold and some emerging market currencies, even if its fundamentals do not depend on any single country’s economy. So when Japan’s moves ripple into global yields, Bitcoin can react before anyone finishes explaining the bond math on TV. We have already seen a version of that movie lately. Global bonds sold off after hawkish comments from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, and Bitcoin fell 5.5% in the same session, extending its monthly drop to more than 20%. That is the bridge between “Tokyo bond auction” and “why did my crypto portfolio just bleed.” Japan's 55% to 20% tax cut and crypto reclassification create institutional pathways where XRP already dominates $21.7 billion in JPY on-ramp volume and SBI's remittance infrastructure. There is a plumbing story here, and it matters more than the headlines. For years, one of the simplest trades in global finance was borrowing in yen at very low rates, then putting that money to work in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. It does not always show up as a single obvious position you can point at; it shows up as a backdrop, as a source of steady demand for risk and yield. When Japan tightens, that backdrop changes. If the yen strengthens or funding costs rise, that carry trade can unwind. Unwinds tend to be messy because they are driven by risk limits, margin calls, and crowded exits. The Bank for International Settlements studied a volatility burst and carry trade unwind in August 2024 and described how large FX carry positions were especially sensitive to spikes in volatility and were forced to unwind quickly. You do not need to believe crypto is “part of the carry trade” to see the connection. You just need to accept that when leverage gets pulled out of the system, the most liquid risk assets often get sold first, and Bitcoin is one of the most liquid risk assets on the planet. Aggressive selling and whale activity reflects Bitcoin's struggle to maintain critical $90,000 level amid market-wide downturn The long end of Japan’s curve is reacting to policy uncertainty too. The 40-year yield jump is tied to investor anxiety over a snap election and fiscal plans, the kind of political catalyst that can turn a slow grind into a sudden lurch. Markets can tolerate a lot, they hate guessing games about issuance, spending, and the future buyer base for government debt. If investors begin to suspect Japan will be leaning more heavily on the bond market, and doing so while its central bank is less willing to suppress yields, they demand more compensation. That is what a rising long bond yield often represents, the market asking to be paid more for time and uncertainty. The durable question is simple, does Japan’s shift keep global financial conditions tighter than markets are expecting. If the answer is yes, crypto’s upside gets capped, rallies become choppier, leverage becomes more fragile, and every risk flare-up feels sharper. If the answer is no, and Japan’s transition stays orderly, then the bond market stops being the main character, and Bitcoin goes back to trading its usual mix of liquidity, positioning, and narrative. There are a few forward paths worth mapping, and none of them require pretending anyone can predict a Bitcoin candle. Japan continues raising rates gradually, the bond market absorbs it, auctions stay decent, yields stay high but stop behaving like a panic meter. In this world, the pressure on crypto shows up as a steady headwind. Higher risk-free returns compete with speculative appetite. Bitcoin can still run, especially if other forces turn supportive, but the market keeps looking over its shoulder at real yields. More weak auctions, more headlines about demand, more volatility at the long end. Global yields jump as relative value traders adjust and as investors worry about repatriation flows, then equities and crypto take the hit. The recent example is already on the tape, global bonds slid on hawkish BOJ signals, and Bitcoin dropped 5.5% on the day. This scenario tends to look like forced selling. Fundamentals become background noise. Japan’s officials push back hard against disorderly moves, issuance choices shift, bond buying operations, and guidance are used to cool volatility, and yields stop surging. That can loosen global conditions at the margin, simply by removing a source of stress. Bitcoin responds the same way it often does when the market senses less pressure from rates and funding. The point is not that Japan “helps crypto,” the point is that global liquidity expectations shift. Japan’s debt has soared to nearly 235% of GDP, an unprecedented level for a developed economy, with lessons for the U.S. and other countries borrowing without limits. If you want to stay ahead of the story, you do not need twenty indicators. You need a handful. This part gets missed in a lot of crypto coverage. Crypto has its own internal money system, stablecoins act like the cash register. When monetary policy shocks hit traditional markets, stablecoin liquidity can move too, which changes crypto market conditions even if on-chain narratives stay the same. A BIS working paper on stablecoins and monetary policy found that US monetary policy shocks drive developments in both crypto and traditional markets, while traditional markets do not react much to crypto shocks in the other direction. That supports the broader point that crypto is downstream of macro funding conditions more often than it wants to admit. Somewhere in Tokyo, there are insurers and pension managers staring at the same problem everyone is staring at, yield has returned, and it comes with volatility attached. Somewhere else, there is a crypto trader in New York or London watching Bitcoin chop sideways, wondering why a move in Japanese bonds is pulling on their screen. This is why. Japan is changing the price of money after decades of holding it down. That adjustment is reaching into every corner where leverage and risk live, and crypto sits right there, liquid, global, always open, always ready to react. If Japan’s bond market stays calm, crypto gets a cleaner runway. If Japan’s long end keeps throwing off stress signals, the market is going to keep learning the same lesson, Bitcoin trades on the future, and the future is priced in yields.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. With IBIT near $70B and G-SIB broker-dealers acting as authorized participants, margin and liquidity shocks get harder to dismiss. Japan's 55% to 20% tax cut and crypto reclassification create institutional pathways where XRP already dominates $21.7 billion in JPY on-ramp volume and SBI's remittance infrastructure. With the BOJ letting rates run to levels not seen in decades, the structural "term premium" is rising, a direct headwind for long-duration crypto exposure. When your bank account becomes a tool of geopolitical coercion, the "rupture" at Davos changes everything you know about financial safety. If the spike sticks, inflation expectations can reprice, real yields can jump, and Bitcoin’s liquidity tailwind can flip fast.

Title: ‘Challenge is still there’ over Greenland despite Trump ruling out force, Denmark warns

Denmark has welcomed Donald Trump‘s announcement that he will drop tariffs and rule out force to take Greenland, but warned that the US president still “has an ambition we can’t accommodate”. Mr Trump rowed back on his threat to slap tariffs on Nato allies who opposed his ambitions to annex Greenland on Wednesday night after he and the alliance’s chief “formed the framework of a future deal” for the Arctic region. In recent days Mr Trump had upped the pressure on Europe to cede control of Greenland or face the consequences, saying that Nato owed it to the US to grant it full rights to the territory. Denmark’s foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, said on Wednesday night that the day had “ended better than it started” and it was “positive” that Mr Trump planned to end the trade war. “It is a signal, I hope, that we can now have talks with Trump’s people,” he said, adding that discussions needed to end in a way that “respects the Greenlandic people.” But he added: “Trump saying he won’t use force is a good signal, but it is still clear that Trump has an ambition that we can’t accommodate”. Swedish foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard ‍also welcomed the change in Mr Trump’s stance on ‍Greenland. “Good that Trump has now backed away from tariffs ⁠on those of us ⁠who have supported Denmark ⁠and Greenland,” she said on ‍X. “The demands about moving borders has received well-earned criticism. That is also why we have repeated that ‌we will ‌not be blackmailed. It appears that our ‌work together with allies has had ⁠an impact.” The European Union’s 27 leaders, meanwhile, will meet in Brussels on Thursday evening to game out a joint response to the developments. The European Council summit had been expected to discuss the prospects of talking the US president down from his demands that negotiations begin immediately to arrange the “sale” of Greenland from Denmark to the US. French president Emmanuel Macron had signalled that he wanted the EU to take a tougher stance in its relations with the White House than it has to date. Discussions between the European Commission and national capitals had indicated a clear desire from most governments to avoid an economically damaging trade war between Brussels and Washington. The EU summit had intended to sound out the levels of political support for various steps of possible retaliation, in the event the Trump administration proceeded with threats to levy fresh tariffs on Denmark and other EU countries on February 1st. An initial EU retaliation, limited to a package of counter-tariffs to hit up to €93 billion worth of US trade, had been on the agenda. The European Parliament, meanwhile, decided to suspend its work on the European ‍Union’s trade deal with the United States in protest at president Donald Trump’s demands ‍to acquire Greenland and threats of tariffs on European allies who oppose his plan. The EU assembly has been debating legislative proposals to remove many EU import duties ‌on US goods, a key part of the agreement struck in Turnberry, Scotland, at ⁠the end of July, as well as to continue zero duties ‌for ​US ‍lobsters, initially agreed with Trump in 2020. The proposals require approval by the parliament and EU governments. [ Trump’s Davos speech reflects how emboldened he has become and how ineffectual Europe isOpens in new window ] Many politicians have complained that the trade deal is lopsided, with the ⁠EU required to cut most import duties while the US sticks ⁠to a broad rate of 15 per cent. ⁠However, they had previously appeared willing to accept it, albeit with conditions, such as an 18-month sunset clause ‍and measures to respond to possible surges of US imports. The trade committee of the European Parliament was due to set its position in votes on January 26th-27th. However, this has now been postponed. The chair of the committee Bernd Lange told a news conference on Wednesday that the new tariff threats had ‌broken the Turnberry deal, ‌saying it would now be put on hold until further notice. However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead ‌to higher US tariffs. The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such ⁠as cutting tariffs on spirits or steel, until the deal is in place. Separately, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde walked out of a dinner at the World Economic Forum during a speech critical of Europe by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. The ECB president exited during a passage of heavy criticism levelled at Europe by Mr Lutnick that drew heckling at the dinner on Tuesday night, said one of the sources who was briefed on what happened. The dinner was hosted by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink as co-chairman of the World Economic Forum for all of the major members of the forum along with heads of state and other dignitaries, a person who was invited to it said. A couple of hundred people were invited to the dinner. Mr Fink ended the dinner before dessert after the heckling incident as people were walking out, one of the sources said. – Additional reporting by Reuters and Bloomberg Understand world events with Denis Staunton's Global Briefing newsletter Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The gathering on Tuesday night descended into uproar after combative remarks from Lutnick, according to several people present, with widespread jeering amid appeals for calm from BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the host of the event and interim co-chair of the WEF. Lagarde was among the attendees who walked out during the speech, according to people familiar with the matter. This year’s gathering in the Alps has the theme: “A spirit of dialogue.” Lutnick told his audience that the world should focus on coal as an energy source rather than renewables, according to one person present, and made dismissive comments about Europe… One chief executive present described the atmosphere as “tense”, while another said it was “noisy and spicy”. One of the hecklers was Al Gore, the former US vice-president, according to two executives present… Gore said: “I sat and listened to his remarks. I didn’t interrupt him in any way. It’s no secret that I think this administration’s energy policy is insane. And at the end of his speech I reacted with how I felt, and so did several others.” … Fink told the FT before the conference: “We are living in a more polarising world. There’s more people talking at each other, not to each other.” He added: “It is my role to elevate everybody and have a serious conversation.” US and EU relations are at a low ebb after the US president threatened to impose new tariffs on certain European countries if he is not allowed to “acquire” Greenland… Reuters adds: ECB President Christine Lagarde walked out of a dinner at the World Economic Forum during a speech critical of Europe by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and the hosts called off the event before dessert, sources familiar with the matter said.

They are SUCH a bunch of whiny 5-year-olds (and I’m sure I’m being unfair to many 5-year-olds). What an embarrassment for the US. And it won’t go away when they do .. @Elizabelle: the problem being, for all the childish whining, petulant demands, and blatant grifting, the US is still the biggest gorilla in the room. You might have a more serious discussion, but lacking THE major player, it would be considerably less useful. It does seem like this is finally getting some of the Euros to take the EU seriously as a unitary actor, which on balance is a good thing imo, but it comes very much at the expense of the US. The Trump people are systematically destroying a lot of our influence, both now and for the future. They couldn’t have done more if they were a cabal of hostile undercover operatives. It’s fkin mind-boggling. rikyrah January 21, 2026 at 2:08 pm Lutnick is a boot licking grifter. please research how HIS SONS are going to cash in once the Supreme Court comes down against Trump and the tariffs. rikyrah January 21, 2026 at 2:09 pm THEE ENTIRE PHUCK!!

This is harder than anyone might think. Sometimes, all you get is someone like me who is mildly curious. 2) Lack of support. What turned me off of my county Dems was that after the initial reaching out, it became very clear very quickly that they weren’t going to do much else. Every step of the process was something I was going to have to personally do. They didn’t even offer suggestions on people who could help manage the campaign. I was expected to just know this shit. 3) Lack/Mismanagement of resources. At the end of the day, even state party apparatus have disastrously little to work it. A lot of donations either go to the national level or to specific campaigns. And national level Dems seem to invest the bulk of that into consultants who do less than jack shit.

JML January 21, 2026 at 2:40 pm @rikyrah: it’s a bad miss, but finding good candidates to run for these kinds of judicial posts can be hard: they’re often not seen as good jobs. The salary is poor for anyone who is a rising star in the private sector of the legal field, and for people looking to become a judge, they want to go federal where the salaries still aren’t great but you never have to stand for election. Unfortunately it can be a hard sell for good candidates. now, to not field anyone is pretty brutal, but at the same time if you’re a young lawyer trying to make your way, is taking 6 months to a year off and running for judge a good career move? It’s so damn expensive. even if you don’t end up having to put your own money into it (and most people do, at least early on until they can raise some money), you end up having to quit your job or take a leave of absence and not get paid because running for office is a full-time job for any challenger. It sucks. I had a friend run for judge out in NV and it was really rough on her, and was compounded by her losing, despite being a great candidate. Jeffro January 21, 2026 at 2:41 pm yes, COAL, glorious COAL! preach it, Brother Lutnick!! there must be a word in German for “national suicide by rule of morons who deserve a fist in the face” Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 2:44 pm @Jeffro: i think the word is “Nationalsozialismus” Scout211 January 21, 2026 at 2:45 pm Petty. Newsom barred from public address in Switzerland by the Trump administration Gov. Gavin Newsom was scheduled to speak during the World Economic Forum on Wednesday morning in Davos, Switzerland, but was barred from speaking at the very last minute by the White House, according to his office. “Under pressure from the White House and State Department, USA House (a church acting as the official US pavilion) is now denying entry to Governor Newsom after Fortune — the official media partner — invited him to speak,” the governor’s office said in a text to the governor’s press corps and later posted to the governor’s official X account. The USA House is the collection of official U.S. venues during the World Economic Forum. . . . “This came after multiple Trump Administration officials spokeat USA House throughout the day — including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who attacked the Governor earlier this morning, calling him ‘economically illiterate’ and ‘worse than Kamala,’” according to Newsom’s office. The governor’s office provided screenshots of texts and emails to the press corps to support its account. Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 2:47 pm So, big change from last year when it seemed like all the big shots at Davos were happy as clams about Trump coming back, eh? Hasn’t worked out quite like they expected. JWR January 21, 2026 at 2:48 pm Just heard on TV news that Trump claims to have reached an agreement with whoever’s in charge at DAVOS and so no tariffs will be needed. We shall see. So, we can get back to The Epstein Files, right? PS. a bit of unwanted action from CBP: WILLOWBROOK, Calif. (KABC) — A federal agent opened fire during an operation Wednesday morning in Willowbrook, prompting a large response from local and federal authorities. […] No one was struck by gunfire, the sheriff’s spokesperson told ABC7, adding that all suspects targeted by the operation were detained and all officers were accounted for. Chief Oshkosh January 21, 2026 at 2:51 pm @Scout211: Maybe The Netherlands and Norway can offer Newsom venues for multiple speeches. Captain C January 21, 2026 at 2:52 pm @rikyrah: Isn’t this the state party that the Bend A Knee caucus took over? Or were they ousted, and if so how much damage did they leave? Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 2:52 pm @Jeffro: He’s got Appalachian dimwits and fossil energy middlemen to placate. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 2:53 pm @Chief Oshkosh: He should record it and leak it online for someone to play at the forum. That’s how the administration gets things out. Baud January 21, 2026 at 2:54 pm @Matt McIrvin: Leopards eat international faces too. Baud January 21, 2026 at 2:55 pm @Captain C: There was a dust up a few years ago, but I think they have new people now. Probably had trouble finding people to run, as others said. Scout211 January 21, 2026 at 2:56 pm @JWR: Just heard on TV news that Trump claims to have reached an agreement with whoever’s in charge at DAVOS and so no tariffs will be needed The Details. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that he would not impose tariffs on eight European countries that were set to go into effect on Feb. 1 unless those countries allowed the United States to take control of Greenland. . . . “Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” he added. Trump had said if those countries did not comply with his demands by June, the tariff would rise to 25%. Trump’s comments over the weekend roiled global markets. Stocks soared to the highs of the day on Trump’s announcement that the tariffs were off. Sounds like TACO to me. “Frame work of a future deal.” LOL Stocks are sure overly emotional. They need to calm down. ;-) Belafon January 21, 2026 at 2:56 pm @Captain C: I’m curious. Did anyone volunteer to run and were told no? Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 3:01 pm @JML: Campaigning for something like that in a state as spread out as Nevada would be a sonofabitch. My stint at campaigning for a family court slot in a relatively compact three county exurban circuit consisting of 634 square miles and 100,000 people (adjoining a large urban center, so broadcast and print media were prohibitive) is illustrative. I consumed a lot of nights and weekends on the rubber chicken circuit along with a lot of phone calls and 10K in cash, and didn’t make it out of the primary. For a State Supreme Court race, the election itself is a sacrifice – you’re giving up your family and friends for the better part of a year, and it is genuinely exhausting. Deputinize America January 21, 2026 at 3:01 pm @JML: Campaigning for something like that in a state as spread out as Nevada would be a sonofabitch. My stint at campaigning for a family court slot in a relatively compact three county exurban circuit consisting of 634 square miles and 100,000 people (adjoining a large urban center, so broadcast and print media were prohibitive) is illustrative.

Ballotpedia.org: 2016 – Incumbent 71.6%, write-in remainder 2018 – No Incumbent. 45% / 32%, write-in remainder 2020 – Incumbent 77.4%, write-in remainder 2022 – No Incumbent. 75.9%, write-in remainder 2024 – Incumbent 69.7%, write-in remainder 2026 – 2 incumbents running for 2 seats It looks like incumbents get 70+% of the vote. Maybe Democrats would have a slightly better chance for open seats, but there aren’t any this year. Sensible prospective candidates have to pick their battles if they really want a chance to win. It’s really easy for opinion-havers to tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong… FWIW. Thanks. Best wishes, Scott.

So if you want to tell someone to blow it out their ass, don’t tell Princess, tell me. But now I’m curious. Which of the various demographic groups are you in? I’ll go first. I’m a White male Democrat. And by the way: going from 45D-47R to 46D-53R is not “tripling down.” The margin tripled, not the the base numbers. So let me ask another question: what do you have against White women as a class? I doubt it’s just their political leanings. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 3:22 pm @Baud: 100% TACO.

By 2029, however, it is unlikely that any US president will have that honor again. It was tied to US credibility and strength, both of which are collapsing fast. Who knows?

I just provided the proof. I have a real, real big problem with bigots. I don’t give two hoots about what gender they are. White males are an ugly problem that we’ve had forever, but nobody is surprised when I tell them a wide majority of white men voted Trump. They’re very surprised when I tell that that despite Roe vs. Wade being stricken, a majority of white women still voted for Trump. After the Access Hollywood tape came out, a majority of white women still voted for Trump. That’s just pure bigotry. Dying of Whiteness, female edition. AFAIAC, bigots are bigots. They can all go to hell. They wanted this. I’m white cis heterosexual male. And being a lifetime D voter from GenX, *I* am in the gross minority. And it sucks. But there is zero I can do to change it. Most white males want me dead, too. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 3:31 pm I do not understand why rich fuckwads like Lutnick and Bessent are all in on the Trump 2.0 agenda.

They being Trump voters, right? I’ll assume “they” doesn’t mean white women. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 3:37 pm @Baud: Carney sees the threats clearly. We keep arguing here about “messaging” and “only Democrats have agency” and “vibes” and “performative outrage”, at the core….. all of those arguments are really circling around the same thing, which is that all of us Dems are fucking terrified right now and we are looking for signs that our leaders are seeing the threats as clearly as we need them to. Our party cannot respond appropriately if we do not fully grasp what we’re dealing with. It honestly made me feel good that Carney is completely and fully aware. I wish I could take my family and be under his leadership. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 3:39 pm @Old School: Right. The white women – and white voters in general – that voted Trump. The ones that voted for Harris, I have nothing but admiration for. They’re the ones who should be running this country, but instead we got fascism. Because white supremacy uber alles is what the majority of white people vote for. Men and women. Little things like losing their right to bodily autonomy didn’t change white women’s voting patterns at all. White men’s has always sucked, especially from my Reaganaut generation. It got more pro fascist over time, not less. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 3:42 pm @chemiclord: 2) Lack of support. What turned me off of my county Dems was that after the initial reaching out, it became very clear very quickly that they weren’t going to do much else. Every step of the process was something I was going to have to personally do. They didn’t even offer suggestions on people who could help manage the campaign. I was expected to just know this shit. I’ve articles where candidates experience mirrors your own regarding lack of support. The same articles point out Republicans are good at supporting the candidates they recruit doing the sort of things the Democrats don’t do. comrade scotts agenda of rage January 21, 2026 at 3:42 pm @Elizabelle: I hope Lutnick and his conniving family go bankrupt.

Archon January 21, 2026 at 3:49 pm @ArchTeryx: You can’t explain how and why the majority of white woman voted for Trump without mentioning racism and the appeal of white patriarchy to ALOT of white woman. In a way I understand, after all their fathers are white, their husbands are white and their sons are white. MazeDancer January 21, 2026 at 3:54 pm @Another Scott: Karoline Leavitt tweeted that Trump was calling Greenland a piece of ice because that was what it is And that the reporter who asked was the only one who had. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:55 pm @Archon: It takes 66 books to explain it. trollhattan January 21, 2026 at 3:56 pm Clintons’ letter got the expected response. IDC, it’s still a great letter. The House Oversight Committee voted to advance two resolutions to the House floor recommending that Bill and Hillary Clinton be found in contempt of Congress, The Hill reports. Both votes were bipartisan. The Bill Clinton resolution passed 34-8 and the Hillary Clinton resolution passed 28-15. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:57 pm @MazeDancer: Gotta love how they come up with rationale for his statements. Like his “Lowering by 1500%”, which they explained by saying that since the old price will be 1500% higher than the new price, then that’s how much it went down. Newspeak for the win. JML January 21, 2026 at 3:58 pm @MazeDancer: Prue will be missed. She was quite good on the show; she could be critical without being cruel and you have to respect her fondness for the boozy desserts. I didn’t realize she was 86! I wonder who they’ll get to replace her? Belafon January 21, 2026 at 3:58 pm @trollhattan: The next one will just say “I don’t have to. Republicans already set that precedent.” Baud January 21, 2026 at 3:59 pm @trollhattan: Well, that’s disappointing. So much for standing up to Republicans. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:01 pm @Suzanne: Sorry I’m an outlier. I just don’t worry about party strategy. Belafon January 21, 2026 at 4:04 pm @Baud: Imagine living in a world where voters are all “I know the current party is evil, but I’m gonna stick with them because the other party hasn’t told me what they stand for.” Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:06 pm JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that the U.S. is “less reliable” as a global ally under President Trump, but he was otherwise reluctant to criticize Trump during his interview with The Economist at the World Economic Forum. Asked if he agrees with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s assessment that there’s been a “rupture in the world order,” Dimon rejected the binary question. “It’s not a rupture,” he said. “If you said to me, ‘has America become unreliable?’ No. It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.” … Dimon’s most adamant disagreement with the Trump administration came when he was asked about the president’s recent proposal to impose a 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. “It would be an economic disaster,” he said, noting that his company “would survive it” but “you have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business. I mean drastic.” He added the move could remove credit from 80 percent of Americans. Suzanne January 21, 2026 at 4:07 pm @Baud: I’m a member of the Democratic Party. I can control what I do and how I vote. “Sees the threats presented by the Republican Party, a group of amoral billionaires and their bootlickers” is literally going to be my first criterion for deciding who I’m gonna vote for in the primary and to whom I’ll donate. IMO, understanding the full nature of the problem is the first step toward effectiveness. Old School January 21, 2026 at 4:08 pm @trollhattan: Both votes were bipartisan. Here are the details: Nine Democrats voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution: Reps. Maxwell Frost (Fla.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.), Summer Lee (Pa.), Stephen Lynch (Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Emily Randall (Wash.), Lateefah Simon (Calif.), Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Three voted in favor of the Hillary Clinton measure: Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:11 pm @Belafon: I’m a partisan. I enjoy a strong speech and aggressive in-your-face action as much as anyone else. But I don’t stress about its absence, especially since I see enough examples of Dems doing it. I don’t need more. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:14 pm @Suzanne: As far as I’m concerned, people still have moral freedom to vote however they wish in the primary. The general election is a different matter, not that I can enforce my morality on others. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 4:16 pm @trollhattan: From your link. Democrats are not going to do jackshit to stop the right-wing fascist take over of the country. Winning and crushing Republicans like a bug is what’s needed. Voting to hold two prominent Democrats in contempt means Democrats care more about norms and comity than crushing Republicans. Nine Democrats voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution: Reps. Maxwell Frost (Fla.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.), Summer Lee (Pa.), Stephen Lynch (Mass.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Emily Randall (Wash.), Lateefah Simon (Calif.), Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Three voted in favor of the Hillary Clinton measure: Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib. ”I am deeply troubled that the individuals who are the subject of today’s hearing did not appear on their scheduled date,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) said. “No one is above the law, but I do know based on the correspondence that they have been corresponding with you regularly to try to resolve this issue. But I don’t believe that’s what this hearing is actually about because if it was actually about getting justice and about getting the truth, we would have DOJ here. We would be holding Pam Bondi in contempt and we would be hearing from the survivors themselves.” Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) introduced an amendment to hold Bondi in contempt for “failing to comply” with the law requiring the DOJ to release its Epstein files. It failed along party lines, 24-19. ETA: Democrats are too obsessed with processes than they are in getting their agenda through. Makes Democrats weak in the face of Republicans who will do almost anything to have their way. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:18 pm @gene108: Yeah, that vote is more depressing than most of the things that gets under the Internet’s skin. And those Dems aren’t the old fogies that everyone is supposed to hate for being out of touch. mrmoshpotato January 21, 2026 at 4:24 pm @Baud: Krishnamoorthi is running for Durbin’s Senate seat here in Illinois. WaterGirl January 21, 2026 at 4:25 pm @MazeDancer: How embarrassing for her to write something so ridiculous. Matt McIrvin January 21, 2026 at 4:25 pm @gene108: Judging from the list of Democrats who voted for it, it looks to me less like a vote for norms and comity, and more like the left wing of the party getting to stick it to the Clintons. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 4:26 pm @Archon: That removes agency from them I refuse to remove. MOST of them had a clear choice in the voting booth, away from all those malign influences. They still chose Trump. And a lot did not need any prodding from white men to do it. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:26 pm @Matt McIrvin: That would be even worse. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:28 pm In Davos Trump has repeatedly confused Greenland with Iceland. Here’s Governor Newsom’s post tam1MI January 21, 2026 at 4:30 pm @Matt McIrvin: Judging from the list of Democrats who voted for it, it looks to me less like a vote for norms and comity, and more like the left wing of the party getting to stick it to the Clintons. Same here. Baud January 21, 2026 at 4:32 pm So who’s going to update the Wikipedia page on the Horseshoe theory to reflect today’s vote? gene108 January 21, 2026 at 4:33 pm @Matt McIrvin: They are also among the younger people in Congress. They were kids during the 1990’s. They might not appreciate how good the U.S. was doing when Bill left office financially, and diplomatically. They’re the generation that’s supposed to be fighters. I think it’s only a matter of time before the right-wing fascist takeover of the U.S. happens. Right-wingers will refine their mistakes from Project 2025 and try again and again and again until they succeed. Any time Democrats control the federal government is just a delay for the inevitable. Democrats do not have enough of a ruthless streak to brake the ways Republicans have consolidated power from media consolidations to the SCOTUS to big tech. satby January 21, 2026 at 4:35 pm @Baud: and one of the few times I would agree with Matt Mc’s assessment. Geminid January 21, 2026 at 4:35 pm @ArchTeryx: Those seem like small, almost trivial majorities to me; less than 11 out of 20 as compared more than 9 out of that 20. So if one out of 20 White women were to switch sides, a majority of White women would have been in the right. Now, you could say this proves White women could have stopped Trump. But this is true of several other groups, my own most of all. So I don’t see the point in singling out White women as opposed to White men. They do not have some special obligation to vote Democratic, and neither do Black, Hispanic, Jewish, Muslim or LGBTQ people. And it’s patronizing to think otherwise, in my opinion. I think there is a notion that these groups owe their votes to Democrats because the Democratic Party has stood up for them. But they’ve all had to stand up for themselves plenty, and they have the right to vote as they see fit. It’s are our job to persuade them to vote for Democrats, and I think we do that job better if we don’t start out with the assumption that they owe us something on account of their demographic profile. And I think we do better as people when we look at others as individuals, and not as members of this group or that. That’s what we do when we start blaming groups for electoral outcomes. Now don’t get get me wrong; I’m as interested in cross-tabs, demographic shifts, etc. as the next person. But that’s in order to learn, not to blame. I think blaming is one of the most useless and self-defeating of all human activities. So is hating, but that’s a whole other story. ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 4:40 pm @Geminid: Where the crosstabs fail is separating the bigots from those that went along to go along. But that’s a topic that’s been discussed to death already here: How to reach Trump voters who may not have been necessarily bigots. My fundamental problem is when people vote their bigotry above all else. I’m not giving white males a pass. But most of them are ungettable at this point. They are totally invested in white supremacy, especially from my generation. Nothing, and nobody, is going to change that. They’re also not the ones being reduced to second class citizens and having their rights taken away, but vote for the face-eating leopards anyway. That’s a level of stupidity that I cannot abide any more. And it doesn’t matter whether you’re talking men or women. I’ve cut both out of my social circle after they voted in Trump 2.0. Bigots are bigots to me. Bokonon January 21, 2026 at 4:41 pm @gene108: They constantly humiliate themselves anytime they speak to the media or give a speech. They don’t care.

ArchTeryx January 21, 2026 at 4:45 pm @Omnes Omnibus: Tripled down on the margins, not the total vote (which wouldn’t be possible). Trump goes from winning them 2% to winning them 7% after COVID hits? 7/2 is 3.5x. That’s a breathtaking level of stupidity. Fewer of them voted Trump in 2024 but not that many. People want to prove me a misogynist. Wrong. I don’t hate all women. But voting Trump was an act of supreme stupidity in 2020 and 2024. I’ve long ago come to the conclusion that men as a whole are absolutely bone-deep stupid. I expected better of women.

Bigots are bigots to me. As I have noted here before, most men, even white men, are far better served by Democratic presidents than Republicans. Working-class men, men on Social Security, men with disabilities, men in unions, men who needed student loans to go to college, men who need healthcare, gay and trans men. It’s not like white men who vote for Democrats are being selfless. Enlightened self-interest is still self-interest. Yet you seem to think that white women are the ones being irrational and stupid while giving white men a pass. That’s a whole stack of misogynist bullshit.

Another Scott January 21, 2026 at 5:11 pm @trollhattan: More from NPR.org: Democrats who opposed the contempt charges used Wednesday’s hearing to argue that the vote amounted to little more than political score settling. “It’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” said California Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel. For example, former U.S. attorneys general Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions and Merrick Garland also did not appear after receiving subpoenas — and none of them has been held in contempt. Comer said that was because they submitted written testimony and did not recall any information relevant to the investigation. Garcia said the Clintons have turned over information to the committee, and offered alternatives to testify under a different format. Garcia urged Republicans to instead negotiate an interview with President Clinton, noting that he was willing to cooperate. Democrats also argued that Republicans are not serious about the Epstein probe, noting that the Department of Justice has failed to fully cooperate with a legal mandate to release its tranche of files from investigations into the late sex offender. “We all agree, we all want to hear from former President Bill Clinton,” said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said. “But committee Republicans have failed to conduct a serious investigation.” Comer wants some big, distracting, scalps. FWIW.

The measure would have passed without them. Professor Bigfoot January 21, 2026 at 5:29 pm @ArchTeryx: It only makes sense that white men would be attracted to white male supremacy. White men, and ONLY white men, have never had their human rights questioned on this continent; so as people whose human rights have been plainly abrogated it’s disconcerting to see that group join in with the oppressor. I wish we could acknowledge this: that it’s not evil or insane for a white man to be attracted to the GOP and white male supremacy; that it is only natural for them to be drawn to it, and we should treasure those white men who specifically reject it. We celebrate alcoholics who give up the sauce; we need to celebrate those white men who give up the white supremacy.

I never excused white men; in fact, I specifically called them stupid for this crap. Would it make everyone feel better if I said women who voted Trump are every bit as stupid, short-sighted and blinkered as men who do it? I may look like a white man, but they are coming for me every bit as much as immigrants. Make no mistake about that.

I say old, off white guy because my skin is somewhat tan. I’m wearing a white teeshirt currently and my skin is not white compared to that teeshirt. It may be closer to that white teeshirt than to the type color of this comment, but it does not fit within the concept of actually white, like the comment box I’m typing in. This is one of the things that pisses me off because the color of a human’s skin is based upon not on all the chemicals in our bodies but basically because of the LEVEL of one chemical that 99.9999% of us have in our bodies, melanin. Some of us have less and some have more.

Just a thought Citizen Scientist January 21, 2026 at 6:59 pm Uh, not sure if anyone saw this: apparently a whistleblower at DHS revealed that a secret memo authorizes ICE/DHS to just break into private homes without a warrant in obvious violation of the 4A. Double plus good! Baud January 21, 2026 at 7:02 pm The Times reported NATO members “discussed a compromise in which Denmark would give the United States sovereignty over small pockets of Greenlandic land where the United States could build military bases, according to three senior officials familiar with the discussion The Last King of Greenland Baud January 21, 2026 at 7:11 pm Trump interview: President tells CNBC ‘We have a concept of a deal‘ over Greenland It’s back. Karen Gail January 21, 2026 at 7:18 pm @Citizen Scientist: I saw that, noticed that the goon squad didn’t waste any time ramping up. Showing up at homes with riot shields, drawn weapons and screaming at people. The worst of the worst, goon squad; is kidnapping children and teens. Video of at least six goons on one teenaged girl, dragging her from her doctor’s appointment. Karen Gail January 21, 2026 at 7:25 pm @Citizen Scientist: BREAKING: Newly revealed internal ICE memo shows how the Trump regime is illegally telling agents to violate the Constitution! If you needed any further proof that the US Constitution – the foundational governing document that every elected official swears to uphold when they take office – isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on since Donald Trump took office, the latest news from the trenches of the ICE invasion of American cities should be the most convincing proof. Indeed, Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine just crossed a chilling new line – and this time, it’s your front door that’s in the crosshairs. According to a bombshell Associated Press report, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now asserting the power to forcibly enter private homes without a judge’s warrant, based solely on an internal memo quietly circulated inside the agency. No neutral judge. No constitutional check. Just a piece of ICE paperwork and a battering ram. For years, immigrant families were told a simple rule: Don’t open the door unless ICE shows a warrant signed by a judge. That advice was grounded in the Fourth Amendment — the same constitutional protection that keeps police from barging into your house on a whim. Now, Trump’s ICE says: Never mind. The internal memo, signed by ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons and dating back to May of 2025, authorizes officers to forcibly ram themselves into homes using only an administrative warrant – a document signed by ICE itself, not a court. “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,” the memo unilaterally, and illegally, declares Advocates say the policy shreds constitutional protections and reverses decades of legal guidance meant to prevent exactly this kind of abuse. And this isn’t theoretical. The AP personally witnessed ICE officers in Minneapolis smashing through the front door of a Liberian man’s home, rifles drawn, wearing tactical gear – without a judge’s warrant. Just raw force and bureaucratic arrogance. Even worse? A whistleblower complaint says the memo is being used to train new ICE recruits, while written training materials – the ones that still respect the Constitution – are being ignored. Some officers were allowed to read the memo only under supervision, forbidden from taking notes, and then ordered to hand it back. That’s not law enforcement – that’s secrecy bordering on authoritarianism. ICE claims everyone targeted already had “due process.” But the Fourth Amendment doesn’t vanish because someone has an immigration case. It protects everyone inside U.S. borders from unreasonable searches and seizures — full stop. This is what Trump’s immigration crackdown looks like in practice: Doors smashed. Families terrorized. Constitutional rights waved away by an internal memo no one was supposed to see. If federal agents can kick in the doors of immigrants without judicial oversight today, the precedent they’re setting won’t stop there tomorrow. That’s not border security. That’s government power running straight through the front door — Constitution be damned. gene108 January 21, 2026 at 7:30 pm @HopefullyNotCassandra: I read our so classy president claimed to strike a deal with NATO head Mark Rutte to “get” Greenland. My guess is that “deal” exists solely in his orange painted head. The U.S. already has deals to buildup our military presence in Greenland. We had a much larger troop presence there during the Cold War. American companies are able to get rights for mineral exploration. This is why Trump wanting annex Greenland is so coocoo bonkers. We can most of what the current administration wants by peaceful negotiations with Greenland and Denmark.

SFAW January 21, 2026 at 9:09 pm @Omnes Omnibus: ​ Glad to be of service. RevRick January 21, 2026 at 11:10 pm @Jeffro: Lutnick is a typical shortsighted Republican hack. The US has plentiful supplies of cheap coal so all he cares about is peddling it to the world. He is the embodiment of Upton Sinclair’s observation that a man cannot understand something when their paycheck depends upon they’re not understanding it. Surveys show that 11% of the population buys Trump’s claim that climate change science is a hoax, and it’s not worth our breath arguing with them. About 65% are aware that climate change is a real threat, but they feel helpless in how to address it. And many of them are confused about how their votes are connected to addressing it. One thing is clear. Coal is the absolute worst fossil fuel when it comes to the environment. Not only does it produce carbon dioxide, but it also dumps heavy metals into the atmosphere and leaves toxic waste piles behind. But Lutnick doesn’t give a damn. He deserved far worse than the heckling he got.

Title: Palantir CEO says AI ‘will destroy’ this type of job while boosting vocational careers

Workers with college degrees in philosophy and other humanities will have a hard time finding jobs as artificial intelligence takes over the US economy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp cautioned Tuesday. Karp issued the warning after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink asked him if AI will “create jobs or destroy jobs overall” during a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “It will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp replied. “[If] you went to an elite school and you studied philosophy — I’ll use myself as an example — hopefully you have some other skill. That one is going to be hard to market.” Karp, 58, is known for his unorthodox path to leading a top-tier tech company. He earned a a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Haverford College, a JD from Stanford Law School and later a Ph.D. in philosophy from the prestigious Goethe University in Germany before cofounding Palantir alongside billionaire Peter Thiel in 2003. The Palantir boss did not point to specific fields that would face job losses, though graduates in the humanities often pursue careers in academia, law and government. When prodded by Fink, Karp said white collar jobs would likely see some upheaval as a result of AI, while vocational career paths that are typically categorized as blue collar will thrive. As an example, Karp pointed to vocational technicians who are building batteries and other components for tech companies. “If you’re a vocational technician … [they are] very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly. Those jobs are going to become more valuable,” Karp said. Overall, he believes there will be “more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.” Employers, meanwhile, will need to develop “different ways of testing aptitude” beyond academic degrees to get the most out of their workers. During the Davos discussion, Karp and Fink agreed that an education in the humanities was already “hard to market” even before AI reshaped the economy. “It was hard to market. Very hard,” Karp said. “It’s a very, very strong education. If you can get a job, you might keep it. That’s what I always thought, if I finally get a job, I’ll probably keep it and do well, but I’m not sure who’s going to give me my first job.” A number of tech executives have previously warned that AI will result in job losses, especially in white-collar fields. Last May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned of potential mass layoffs in fields like tech, finance and law that could push national unemployment to 20%. As The Post reported in December, Karp, who has described himself as neurodivergent, recently announced that Palantir would offer a new fellowship program specifically crafted for neurodivergent talent. The program was announced shortly after Karp faced social media snark after he was seen fidgeting in his chair and waving his arms throughout an interview with journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin during the New York Times’ DealBook Summit.

Title: Globalization has ‘failed’ the US – commerce secretary

Globalization is a “failed policy” that has “left America behind,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared in Davos on Tuesday, accusing the World Economic Forum (WEF) of pushing a globalist agenda that undermines the West. “The Trump administration and myself, we are here to make a very clear point: globalization has failed the West and the United States of America,” Lutnick told attendees, before turning on the organizers of the summit. “It’s a failed policy. It is what the WEF has stood for, which is export, offshore, far-shore, find the cheapest labor in the world and the world is a better place for it,” he said. “The fact is it has left America behind. It has left the American workers behind. And what we are here to say is ‘America First’ is a different model, one that we encourage other countries to consider.” US President Donald Trump railed against globalization during all three of his presidential campaigns, and at high-profile gatherings like Davos. Vowing to re-industrialize the US and use tariffs to stop the flow of jobs to foreign countries, he promised in 2016 that he would “no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism.” Ten years later, Trump’s program of economic nationalism has strained relations with US allies. Trump threatened eight European NATO member states with 10% tariffs last week, over their opposition to his planned annexation of Greenland, prompting the EU to halt ratification of a landmark trade deal with the US and threaten retaliatory tariffs of his own. Trump’s allies have also gone ahead and forged deals with the US’ chief economic rival, China. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney inked a preliminary trade deal with Beijing last week, describing the agreement as the beginning of “a new strategic partnership” between both countries. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has led the charge in pressing the EU to impose retaliatory levies on the US, called on Tuesday for “more Chinese direct investment in Europe, particularly in critical sectors.” Globalization has FAILED.

According to multiple media reports, the secretary delivered another anti-Europe speech that led to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walking out and the dinner being canceled before dessert.

January 21, 2026 13:09 ET | Source: OGBC OGBC Singapore City, SINGAPORE, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OGBC Group, a Singapore-headquartered innovation hub and investment group, today announced the completion of its Series C preferred equity investment in PsiQuantum, Corp., a quantum computing company developing utility-scale, fault-tolerant quantum systems. OGBC Group is a Singapore-headquartered innovation and investment organization focused on frontier technologies Through this investment, OGBC joins a distinguished group of global institutional backers—including the Australian Federal and Queensland Governments, NVIDIA (via NVentures), Temasek, and leading asset managers such as BlackRock and Baillie Gifford—further strengthening PsiQuantum’s long-term capital base. The investment was made through OGBC Premier PQ Fund, reflecting OGBC’s focus on foundational technologies with long-term global impact. Strategic Alignment in Deep Technology Quantum computing is increasingly viewed as a source of durable strategic advantage. This is not only due to step-change improvements in computational capability, but also through control of scarce quantum resources, proprietary problem encodings, and emerging protocol layers that may define access and interoperability across future systems. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has described the sector as “reaching an inflection point,” a view shared by many industry participants as quantum technologies move closer to large-scale deployment. “At OGBC Group, we focus on aligning long-term capital with companies pioneering breakthrough technologies that have the potential to redefine industries,” said Jayden Wei, Managing Partner and Chairman of OGBC. “PsiQuantum represents a rare convergence of scientific rigor and industrial-scale execution. Joining this investor group alongside NVIDIA and Temasek reflects our conviction that quantum computing will serve as foundational infrastructure for the next era of global computation.” From a research perspective, frameworks such as John Preskill’s "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)" model suggest that early commercial value is likely to emerge from hybrid quantum–classical workflows, well before the arrival of fully fault-tolerant systems. These approaches are expected to complement existing AI infrastructure by addressing structural constraints such as compute scarcity, data fragmentation, and productivity limitations through new forms of optimization and simulation.PsiQuantum’s differentiation lies in its ability to leverage existing semiconductor manufacturing to build a million-qubit, fault-tolerant system. This focus on scalability from inception is designed to deliver a commercially viable quantum advantage, moving the technology from experimental labs to real-world industrial applications. About OGBC Premier OGBC Premier back frontier technologies with disciplined capital, global reach, partnership mindset, and long‑term value — from quantum and AI compute to advanced semiconductors, biotech and programmable financial infrastructure. OGBC Group OGBC Group is a builder-first innovation and investment hub that brings together capital, technology, and culture. Headquartered in Singapore with regional presence across Asia, OGBC supports founders and operators across the digital economy through high-signal events, ecosystem programs, and strategic investments. Since 2023, OGBC has hosted more than 200 industry gatherings, becoming a trusted home for teams building long-term, real-world impact. About PsiQuantum PsiQuantum is developing the world’s first utility-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer. The company’s silicon photonics-based approach leverages standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques to scale quantum systems toward the million-qubit level required for commercially meaningful applications.

Title: Bitcoin and Crypto Entering ‘Existential Crisis’ As DeFi Moves From Niche Experiment To Wall Street: Arca CIO

The chief investment officer at a digital asset investment firm is raising new questions over the future of crypto for one key reason. Arca CIO Jeff Dorman says he believes Bitcoin (BTC) and many other digital assets are unlikely to see values increase from the explosion in the tokenization of assets. Dorman warns there may only be a few beneficiaries from the latest big trend in blockchain use cases such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) plan to launch a tokenized securities platform for 24/7 trading and stablecoin-based funding. Says Dorman, “Crypto really in an existential crisis now. Everything we thought would happen on blockchain is now happening, but little if any of the value accrues to any stocks or tokens in our ecosystem. Fat protocol thesis is long dead. BTC has nothing to do with ANY of the actual blockchain growth engines: no exposure to growth of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Continue to think a handful of DeFi tokens, token launchpad companies, and GLXY [Galaxy Digital] stock are the only clear winners from this trend – when all assets are on on-chain, DeFi goes from niche experiment to the full financial plumbing engine.” However, macro analyst and institutional crypto veteran Dan Tapiero disagrees with Dorman. “Remarkable how wrong this is.” In response to Tapiero’s criticism, Dorman double downs on his view. “Where do you see value accruing from all of the newfound use cases of blockchain? We’re seeing lots of tokenization and heavy adoption of stables and the value is accruing to intermediaries like BlackRock, Securitize and Tether.” Bitcoin is trading for $88,992 at time of writing, down 1.9% in the last 24 hours.

Reading time 2 minutes While tech billionaire Elon MuskÂ argues that advances in AI and robotics will renderÂ saving for retirement irrelevant, claimingÂ that automation will lead to lower costs and abundance for everyone, another tech billionaire is pitching a very different, more believable future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the AI boom will actually increase demand for tradespeople like plumbers and electricians, as well as steel and construction workers. Huang said these workers could make âsix-figure salariesâ thanks to what heâs dubbed the âlargest infrastructure build out in human history,â which he claims is already a few hundred billion dollars in. Huang made the comments today during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At the conference, Fink pressed Huang on how he sees AI reshaping the economy and the labor market. To explain his thinking, Huang broke AI down into what he called a âfive-layer cake.â Applications sit at the top, followed by AI models, cloud services, chips, and energy at the bottom. According to Huang, the real economic gains from AI will come as industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services adopt AI. But to get there, countries first need to build out the lower layers of that cake, which is where trade jobs come in. âAnd so we’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,â said Huang. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You don’t need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â For everyone else, Huang pushed back on fears that AI will rapidly wipe out white-collar professions. He pointed to radiology, a field seen as especially vulnerable because AI systems are good at analyzing images. Instead of replacing radiologists, Huang said AI has helped them become more productive, see more patients, and actually increase the number of radiologists. When asked how this applies to developing countries, Huang argued they should treat AI infrastructure the same way they treat roads and energy. âI really believe that every country should get involved to build AI infrastructure, build your own AI, take advantage of your fundamental natural resource, which is your language and culture,â Huang said. âDevelop your AI, continue to refine it, and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem.â That sentiment vaguely echoed comments made by Palantir CEO Alex Karp at Davos, who said that while AI will destroy jobs in the humanities, it will still leave plenty of work for people with vocational training. âThere will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,â Karp said. âI do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.â Huang ultimately wrapped the conversation with a call for even more investment in AI. All of which is pretty convenient coming from someone whose wealth is tied to a company that powers one of the bottom layers of this AI cake.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is preparing to travel to China in advance of the Lunar New Year holiday as the company works to expand access for its AI processors in the communist country. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is preparing to travel to China later this month as the company works to regain access to one of its most important markets for AI processors. The visit comes at a critical juncture for the world’s most valuable technology company as it navigates complex geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. The Trump administration has approved sales of certain AI chips to China with restrictions. Huang will be in China to attend company celebrations ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays according to company sources. The executive is also expected to visit Beijing, though it remains uncertain whether he will meet with senior Chinese government officials. The source indicated that Huang’s schedule could still be modified depending on whether potential meetings are confirmed. This China visit represents a regular occurrence for Huang, who typically travels to the country during this time of year. However, the timing carries particular significance given recent developments in US-China trade relations concerning advanced semiconductor technology. The United States government is easing export restrictions on AI processors, which will allow Nvidia to sell its H200 model in China. Simultaneously, Chinese government officials are determining how many of these chips will be permitted into the country. China represents the largest market globally for semiconductors and is actively working to develop its domestic chip industry to reduce dependence on American products. Despite these efforts, local Chinese manufacturers currently cannot match the capabilities of Nvidia’s processors, which are essential for developing and operating artificial intelligence models. Although the H200 is one generation behind the Nvidia chips available in the United States market, it is still considered more powerful than competing Chinese offerings. Due to security considerations, the Chinese government claims it will prohibit the H200 chip from being used by the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure operations, and state-owned enterprises, according to people familiar with the situation. This approach mirrors similar restrictions that the Chinese government has previously implemented for foreign technology products, including devices manufactured by Apple and chips produced by Micron Technology. During a previous visit to China in July, Huang successfully secured meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. In January 2025, he also celebrated the Lunar New Year holidays with his employees in China, choosing to skip the inauguration ceremony of United States President Donald Trump. On Wednesday of this week, Huang is scheduled to appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he will be interviewed by BlackRock Incorporated CEO Larry Fink. Breitbart News reported this week that Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has come out forcefully against Nvidia selling chips to China, comparing it to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea: Dario Amodei, Chief Executive Officer of Anthropic, delivered sharp criticism of recent United States policy changes that would allow the sale of sophisticated AI chips to China. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Amodei characterized the decision as having significant national security ramifications and warned against proceeding with such sales. In an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Amodei stated that permitting these chip sales would constitute a major error in judgment. “It would be a big mistake to ship these chips. I think this is crazy. It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally. As tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.” “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone. “Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.” This isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” That optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees. “There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” At the same time, Farley has warned that the country lacks the blue-collar workforce needed to support a manufacturing and infrastructure revival. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios in September. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?” By last summer, Farley said the U.S. was already short 600,000 factory workers and 500,000 construction workers. BlackRock’s Larry Fink has echoed these concerns, singling out the electrical industry as a looming bottleneck. Electrician jobs are expected to grow 9% over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said to an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” Have you given a skilled-trade career a second look thanks to the AI boom?

Title: Jensen Huang says AI bubble fears are dwarfed by ‘the largest infrastructure buildout in human history’

Pushing back against growing skepticism regarding the sustainability of artificial intelligence spending, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued against the mountain backdrop of Davos, Switzerland, that high capital expenditures are not a sign of a financial bubble, but rather evidence of “the largest infrastructure build-out in human history.” Speaking in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, Huang detailed an industrial transformation that extends far beyond software code, reshaping global labor markets and driving unprecedented demand for skilled tradespeople. While much of the public debate focuses on the potential for AI to replace white-collar jobs, Huang pointed to an immediate boom in blue-collar employment required to physically construct the new computing economy. “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers,” Huang said. He noted the urgency to erect “AI factories,” chip plants, and data centers has radically altered the wage landscape for manual labor. “Salaries have gone up, nearly doubled, and so we’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories,” Huang said, emphasizing the industry is currently facing a “great shortage” of these workers. Ford CEO Jim Farley has been warning for months about the labor shortage in what he calls the “essential economy,” exactly the type of jobs mentioned by Huang at Davos. Earlier this month, Farley told Fortune these 95 million jobs are the “backbone of our country,” and that he was partnering with local retailer Carhartt to boost workforce development, community building, and “the tools required by the men and women who keep the American Dream alive.” It’s time we all reinvest in the people who make our world work with their hands,” Farley said. In October, at Ford’s Pro Accelerate conference, Farley shared that his own son was wrestling with whether to go to college or pursue a career in the trades. The Ford CEO has estimated the shortage at 600,000 in factories and nearly the same in construction. Fink brought up the bubble talk for a good reason: Fear of a popping bubble gripped markets for much of the back half of 2025, with luminaries such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, and just the previous day at Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warning about the potential for pain. Much of this originated in the underwhelming release of OpenAI’s GPT-5 in August, but also the MIT study that found 95% of generative AI pilots were failing to generate a return on investment. “Permabears” such as Albert Edwards, global strategist at Société Générale, have talked about how there’s likely a bubble brewing—but then again, they always think that. Huang, whose company became the face of the AI revolution when it blew past $4 trillion in market capitalization (a bar recently reached by Alphabet on the positive release of its Gemini update), tackled these fears in conversation with Fink, arguing the term misdiagnoses the situation. Critics often point to the massive sums being spent by hyperscalers and corporations as unsustainable, but Huang countered the appearance of a bubble happens because “the investments are large … and the investments are large because we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.” Huang went deep into a food metaphor, describing the AI industry as a “five-layer cake” requiring total industrial reinvention, with Nvidia’s chips a particularly crunchy part of the recipe. The bottom layer is energy, followed by chips, cloud infrastructure, and models, with applications sitting at the top. The current wave of spending is focused on the foundational layers—energy and chips—which creates tangible assets rather than speculative vapor. Far from a bubble, he described a new industry being built from the ground up. “There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out,” Huang said, noting that the world is currently only “a few 100 billion dollars into it.” To prove the market is driven by real demand rather than speculation, Huang offered a practical “test” for the bubble theory: the rental price of computing power as seen in the price of Nvidia’s GPU chips. “If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it’s so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,” he said. This scarcity indicates established companies are shifting their research and development budgets—such as pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly moving funds from wet labs to AI supercomputing—rather than simply burning venture capital. Beyond construction and infrastructure, Huang addressed the broader anxiety regarding AI’s impact on human employment. He argued AI ultimately changes the “task” of a job rather than eliminating the “purpose” of the job. Citing radiology as an example, he noted that despite AI diffusing into every aspect of the field over the past decade, the number of radiologists has actually increased. Because AI handles the task of studying scans infinitely faster, doctors can focus on their core purpose: patient diagnosis and care, leading to higher hospital throughput and increased hiring. Fink reframed the issue, based on Huang’s pushback. “So what I’m hearing is, we’re far from an AI bubble. The question is, are we investing enough?” Fink asked, positing that current spending levels might actually be insufficient to broaden the global economy. Huang appeared to say: not really. “I think the opportunity is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved. Everybody ought to get engaged. We need more energy,” he said, adding the industry needs more land, power, trade, scale, and workers. Huang said the U.S. has lost its workforce population in many ways over the past 20 to 30 years, “but it’s still incredibly strong,” and in Europe, looking around Switzerland, for example, he saw “an extraordinary opportunity to take advantage of.” He noted 2025 was the largest investment year in venture capital history, with $100 billion invested around the world, mostly on AI natives. Huang concluded by emphasizing this infrastructure build-out is global, urging developing nations and Europe to engage in “sovereign AI” by building their own domestic infrastructure. For Europe specifically, he highlighted a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to leverage its strong industrial base to lead in “physical AI” and robotics, effectively merging the new digital intelligence with traditional manufacturing. Far from a bubble, he seemed to be saying, this is just the beginning.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2026 7:40:23 AM PST by MtnClimber "Timing, not haste, drives what will happen next." —Thomas Sowell. Larry Fink of BlackRock and the World Economic Forum. Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ---raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bull---- about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost. Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ---raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bull---- about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost. Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock!

Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Title: Al Gore Heckles Trump Official in Davos Speech

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick faced a tough crowd at the World Economic Forum in Davos—and was heckled by a surprising, but familiar, former U.S. vice president. During an official dinner Tuesday night, Lutnick reportedly launched into a tirade criticizing Europe, inviting jeers from the forum’s major members, heads of state, and other dignitaries. “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town,” Lutnick said, according to the Financial Times. Multiple people reportedly started heckling Lutnick’s speech—including former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who started booing the secretary, two executives told the Times. Amid the chaos, Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, walked out of the dinner. The hosting WEF chairman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, ended up calling off the event before desserts had been passed out, one source told Reuters. The U.S. Commerce Department claimed that Gore was the only one who booed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum Wednesday, Trump continued the American posturing as he tried to take credit for Europe’s existence in a winding, incoherent address. What are Donald Trump’s goals for 2026? They’re all over the place. The president was asked about his goals in regard to getting his agenda through Congress ahead of the midterms, and he gave a meandering answer about his own executive orders. “We passed so many executive orders. I have great executive orders that are really common sense and good. I mean, like water coming out of a sink. The water wouldn’t come out. They had all sorts of ridiculous restrictions. I took all of that off,” Trump said to Katie Pavlich on NewsNation Tuesday night. “Coming out of the shower head, you’d stand under the shower, there’s no water coming out, so I passed—so many things like that. “Straws. They don’t have to be paper anymore. They don’t have to melt in your mouth.… I’d like to have that all confirmed by Congress,” Trump continued, before adding that he got more important things accomplished through executive order, and would like to have all of his executive orders confirmed by Congress, estimating that 35 to 40 percent of his executive orders have already become law. “So you want your executive orders codified in law, so to speak,” Pavlich said. “Ideally, we get ’em codified and we get ’em codified soon, yes,” Trump replied. Q: What goals do you have for 2026 for Congress in terms of getting your agenda through?TRUMP: I have great executive orders. Like, water coming out of a sink. The water wouldn't come out. They had all sorts of ridiculous restrictions. I took them off. Straws. They don't have… pic.twitter.com/B1h2shfxoQ Trump is well known for rambling and meandering around reporter’s questions, even in friendly interviews. But the vagueness indicates he’s either fully checked out or he’s hiding his agenda, as Trump and his inner circle are unlikely to settle for simply turning his many damaging executive orders through Congress. Getting Trump’s agenda through Congress will be a tall order. The president could barely get his own budget through Congress last year, and ended up causing a lengthy government shutdown. Trump’s executive orders also would have to survive court challenges, and some of them may not even get through the right-wing Supreme Court. America’s presence at the World Economic Forum Wednesday was overshadowed by its leader’s latest obsession: obtaining Greenland—or, maybe, Iceland, depending on Donald Trump’s ability to remember his military aim. Thousands of influential figures, including prominent CEOs and world leaders, gathered in Davos ahead of the global conference. Trump was asked to deliver opening remarks Wednesday, but his speech went wildly off the rails as he began to hyperfixate on his rationale for staking an American flag in Greenland, a Danish-controlled territory. But over the course of an hour-long (and counting, at time of publication) speech, Trump repeatedly and erroneously mixed up Greenland with Iceland, a completely separate landmass and independent nation, raising alarm over just how educated Trump is on the focal point of his U.S. expansion. Before a host of European leaders—including some of America’s longest allies—Trump insisted that “there’s nothing wrong” with the potential acquisition, likening his desired annexation of the region to Europe’s colonial history. “Just as the European nations have,” Trump said. “All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Trump now confusing Greenland with Iceland multiple times pic.twitter.com/nDvufNVB6T Trump reiterated that the U.S. could take Greenland by the use of “excessive force” that would be “practically unstoppable.” The president has been locked into the idea of obtaining Greenland since at least 2019, when he told reporters that the arrangement could be handled as a “large real estate deal.” In recent weeks, the president’s threats have escalated in fervor and frequency. Earlier this month, Trump told The Atlantic that the U.S. “needs” Greenland “for defense.” But what exactly the White House stands to gain from controlling Greenland isn’t clear, particularly because myriad existing treaties already give the U.S. unfettered access to Greenland as a military base. Forcing the issue, however, could irreversibly damage America’s relations with some of its most significant allies. Over the long weekend, Trump announced a new wave of retaliatory tariffs against European countries that oppose his Greenland takeover, cautioning NATO allies against participation in a joint military exercise on the island. Late into Monday evening, Trump continued to provoke America’s allies by releasing private messages sent to him by French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He also taunted world leaders by sharing images on Truth Social that included a photo of himself in the Oval Office beside a posterboard of the Western hemisphere—with Canada, Greenland, and Venezuela colored in with the American flag. “This would not be a threat to NATO,” Trump claimed before the global conference Wednesday, patting himself on the back for his lackluster support for the U.S.-backed military alliance. “This would greatly enhance the security of the whole alliance. The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. When you think about it, nobody can dispute it. “You have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.” President Trump delivered yet another rambling, long-winded speech Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, using the massive world stage to rail against windmills, complain for the umpteenth time about how the 2020 election was rigged, reaffirm his desire to seize Greenland from Denmark, and take credit for every good thing in the world. The room was dead silent virtually the entire time. “Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable frankly, anymore. They’re not recognizable. And we can argue about it, but there’s no argument,” Trump said early in his speech to the room full of Europeans. “Friends come back from different places—I don’t wanna insult anybody—and say ‘I don’t recognize it.’ And that’s not in a positive way.… It’s not heading in the right direction.” The rhetoric aligned seamlessly with the deeply racist, anti-immigrant sentiments that the European right is pushing with his support. Trump also took the time to hit on one of his favorite punching bags: windmills. “There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place. And they are losers,” Trump said, seemingly talking about the windmills personally. “One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses, and the worse that country is doing. China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any wind farms in China.” This is not true, China has multiple wind turbine farms. Trump: "There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place. And they are losers. One thing I've noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses, and the worse that country is doing. China make almost all of the… pic.twitter.com/cylwZpyzSZ “Did you ever think of that? They put up a couple big wind farms, but they don’t use them, they just put them up to show people what they could look like,” he continued. “They don’t spin, they don’t do anything.” Trump then of course got to Greenland, accidentally mixing it up with Iceland for nearly the entire time he spoke about it. “Until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said, meaning to say Greenland. “They called me daddy … very smart man said, ‘He’s our daddy.’” Trump on NATO: "Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy." (He means Greenland.) pic.twitter.com/9ruzKXQJ2V “So we want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won’t give it,” Trump continued. “We’ve never asked for anything else, and we could have kept that piece of land. And we didn’t. They have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.” Trump: "So we want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won't give it. They have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember." pic.twitter.com/Va3EmvJCrk It’s been a rough 36-ish hours for our fearless leader. On Tuesday, he made a guest appearance at White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefing only to read names and show pictures to the press corp for over an hour. And now, after his plane was initially diverted on its way to Davos last night, he’s doing more useless ranting. President Donald Trump appeared to have never heard of an American held captive by the Taliban for almost a year. During an exclusive interview Tuesday with News Nation, host Katie Pavlich touted Trump’s previous efforts to liberate hostages and asked the president about Dennis Coyle, a U.S. citizen who was reportedly kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan last January. “What is your administration doing to get him home?” Pavlich asked. “Well, if you give me the name,” Trump said, even though Pavlich had just told him. “Dennis Coyle,” she repeated. “Well, if you give me some information, I’ll take care of that,” Trump continued. “I know that your administration is working on it—” Pavlich said. “I know they are,” Trump said quickly. “But I could do some things on the internet that are pretty impactful.” Pavlich asked if Trump had a message for the Taliban, who had held Coyle “for no crime.” “Well I’m not happy about them holding anybody. And especially if he’s not guilty of anything. And it sounds—from what I’ve heard, and again I’m not that familiar with it like you are, but I will certainly take a very strong position on it,” Trump said. PAVLICH: Dennis Coyle has been taken hostage by the Taliban for almost a year. What are you doing to get him home?TRUMP: Well if you give me the name?PAVLICH: Dennis CoyleTRUMP: Ok. You give me some information, I can take care of that. I can do some things on the internet… pic.twitter.com/Nbsi1txmOI But Trump’s remarks made it seem that he’d had never even heard of Coyle at all, and the president’s brilliant plan to free him seemed simply to involve posting a “very strong position” he’d made up on the spot. A former White House attorney is ringing alarm bells over Donald Trump’s declining mental health. Ty Cobb, an employee of the first Trump administration and a now outspoken critic of the president, told The Beat on MS NOW Tuesday that the recent shift in Trump’s psychological condition was “palpable.” That day alone, Trump spent a 90-minute press briefing mumbling to himself over a stack of papers, alleging that “pirating ships” is the only thing that Somalis succeed at, claiming that “God is very proud” of his first year back in office, and alleging that a witness to Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis earlier this month was a “paid agitator.” Outside the press conference, he continued to damage relations with Europe over his obsession with acquiring Greenland. “Those are not the comments of a rational human being and certainly not presidential at all,” Cobb told MS NOW’s Ari Melber. “Likewise, yesterday you had the clear, deranged, demented, and insane note that he sent to the leaders of Norway, saying that because Norway, which has no control over the Nobel Peace Prize, hadn’t given it to him, that he was free to disregard peace and very interested in Greenland. I don’t think there’s anybody outside of the United States who believes that Trump is sane.” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told The Wall Street Journal Monday that he had attempted to negotiate with Trump against a new wave of tariffs on European countries after the U.S. leader suddenly turned sour on NATO countries participating in a joint military exercise in Greenland. Trump, according to Støre, responded that the world would not be safe until America had “Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” “Since you’ve worked for him in the White House, when you make that reference to ‘sane,’ do you mean problems with how he approaches things that have long been there, or are you referring to some decline?” Melber asked. “No, I think there’s been a significant decline,” Cobb said. “He’s always been driven by narcissism. But I think the dementia and the cognitive decline are palpable, as do many experts, including many physicians.” Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has stopped paying for immigrant detainees to receive health care—and isn’t planning on paying for months, independent journalist Judd Legum reported Tuesday. ICE Health Service Corps, the entity that provides immigrants in detention with health care, quietly posted last week that Acentra, the agency’s new third-party administrator for medical claims, would not begin processing claims until at least April 30. “Please continue to hold all claim submissions while IHSC works to bring the new system online in the interim,” the post read. ICE had previously paid the Veterans Association Financial Services Center to process claims for reimbursement—but abruptly ended that contract on October 3, 2025. According to government documents reviewed by Legum, ICE was left with “no mechanism to provide prescribed medication” and no way to “pay for medically necessary off-site care.” Immigrants in detention could no longer receive dialysis, prenatal care, oncology, or chemotherapy. To be clear, ICE is not simply not paying for detainees’ medical treatment: Multiple reports suggest they are not providing it at all, even though federal law requires them to do so. Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff released a report in October documenting at least “85 credible reports of medical neglect” at U.S. detention centers. Internal administration data obtained by Legum suggested that ICE has potentially accrued hundreds of millions of dollars of unpaid medical claims. In 2024, the VA processed $246.42 million in medical claims, but despite a significant increase in the detainee population, the VA processed only $157.2 million in claims in 2025. “Assuming the medical needs of a typical ICE detainee remain constant, the data suggests nearly a $300 million gap between needed care from third-party providers and what ICE paid,” Legum wrote. “This gap is a combination of unpaid bills since October 3 and ICE detainees who are simply being denied necessary medical treatment.” As ICE has upended health care access for immigrants in detention, national detentions have hit record levels, and the numbers of people dying in ICE custody have risen with them. Seven immigrants died in ICE custody in December, making it the deadliest month since Donald Trump returned to the White House. And 2025 was the deadliest year for immigrants in detention since 2004. So far, January is on track to be even worse: At least six people have already died in ICE custody this year, including one man who reportedly was choked to death by an ICE agent. At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, President Trump was asked just how far he’d be willing to go to acquire Greenland. His response: “You’ll find out.” His apparent threat only further reinforces what has been feared for weeks—that Trump will completely fracture U.S. diplomacy with the European Union, or worse, try to take over Greenland regardless of the risk or respect for sovereignty. Reporter: How far are you willing to go to acquire Greenland?Trump: You’ll find out pic.twitter.com/oPLJNc1vvM “If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you’re willing to pay?” a reporter followed up later in the press conference. “I think something’s gonna happen that’s gonna be very good for everybody. Nobody’s done more for NATO than I have.... Getting them to go up to 5 percent of GDP was something that nobody thought was possible,” Trump replied. “I think that we will work something out where NATO’s gonna be very happy and we’re gonna be very happy. But we need it for security purposes.” Q: If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you're willing to pay?TRUMP: That's very interesting. I think something's gonna happen that's going to be very good for everybody. Nobody has… pic.twitter.com/R3emyw2lAO That notion of happiness was quickly questioned, as well. “Mr. President, you said you’re confident something’s gonna get worked out in Greenland, but Greenlanders have made it clear they don’t wanna be part of the U.S. What gives the U.S. the right to take away that self determination—” “When I speak to them, I’m sure they’ll be thrilled.” Q: If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you're willing to pay?TRUMP: That's very interesting. I think something's gonna happen that's going to be very good for everybody. Nobody has… pic.twitter.com/R3emyw2lAO While Democrats and even some Republicans are perplexed and alarmed by Trump’s imperialistic goals, others have thrown their full weight behind them. As Trump himself promised, it seems like only a matter of time before this situation escalates further. Two employees of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency may have been misusing Social Security data. The Social Security Administration referred two DOGE employees to the Justice Department for being in contact with an advocacy group that hopes to “overturn election results in certain states,” Politico reports, citing court documents. One of them allegedly signed an agreement that could have involved using Social Security data to match with state voter rolls. The SSA referred the two employees for violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from using their jobs for political purposes, according to DOJ official Elizabeth Shapiro. The court filings, disclosed Friday, were part of a list of “corrections” on testimony from SSA officials in the legal fight over DOGE gaining access to Social Security data. The disclosures also show that DOGE team members shared information on unauthorized third-party servers and could have accessed data prohibited by court orders at the time. Shapiro said that two employees referred to the DOJ were the only known members involved with the political group, which wasn’t identified in court papers. “At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group. Nor were they aware of the ‘Voter Data Agreement,’” Shapiro wrote, noting that it’s unclear whether the two DOGE employees actually shared data with the group. However, Shapiro said emails “suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.” The news seems to confirm some of the fears surrounding DOGE’s access to sensitive government information: that the data could be used for illegal and nefarious purposes. DOGE’s access went far beyond the SSA to different government agencies including the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department. Who knows if Musk and DOGE are also using that information illegally? It’s been exactly one year since Donald Trump returned to the nation’s highest office. To mark the occasion, the president secured quality time in front of some of America’s top journalists Tuesday to, apparently, do little other than to talk to himself. Trump joined the White House press briefing, sidling up alongside press secretary Karoline Leavitt with a large stack of papers that turned out to be more prop than speech. But it was the content of Trump’s remarks—or rather, lack thereof—that caused some onlookers to question whether the president was in a healthy state of mind. “Hm, I’m just looking at these charges, it’s just pretty incredible,” Trump said, rifling through the stack of papers, intermittently pausing to hold a page up to the camera. “Many murderers. Many, many murderers. People that murdered.” The president did not stop to name names, or to clarify which people he was targeting in his scrambled monologue, but the entries followed a general template that read at the top: “Minnesota: worst of worst.” Trump continued to read names and lists of charges, sometimes without even looking at the camera. Instead, it appeared he was simply reading brand-new information aloud to himself. folks, this is some really weird shit. the president is not well. pic.twitter.com/IQHcbM7mtl Mass protests have kicked off in Minnesota since ICE agents shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on January 7. Since then, federal officers have ripped people from their homes and families, pulled over school buses, attacked teachers and students at a Minneapolis high school, and even clashed with local law enforcement. In response, some protesters have opted to openly carry their firearms through the city, brandishing their Second Amendment right to bear arms. Locals have formed neighborhood watches to follow ICE vehicles, banging pots and pans and screaming to alert others when agents enter their residential neighborhoods. Local politicians—including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—have advised the federal agency to exit their cities and state, arguing that ICE and Border Patrol agents have done more harm than good. In 2025, before Good’s death, the agency killed 32 people—its deadliest year in more than two decades. But rather than heed the warning, the Trump administration has opted to up the ante, issuing grand jury subpoenas to Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, while placing 1,500 active-duty troops on standby for a potential invasion of Minnesota. “I’m going through this because I think we have plenty of time. I’m going to a place—beautiful place—in Switzerland, where I’m sure I’m very happily waited for,” Trump rambled. “In Switzerland they don’t know about this. They have other problems, but they don’t have this problem.” “Look,” Trump said, holding up another page. “Killed someone.”

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Andrew Porter and Robbie Henshaw will miss the start of Ireland's Guinness Six Nations campaign, after both players were left out of the 37-man squad by head coach Andy Farrell. The pair miss out due to injury, with Porter struggling with a calf issue, and Henshaw suffering a knee injury in Leinster's Investec Champions Cup win against Bayonne on Saturday. The IRFU have also confirmed that Leinster's Ryan Baird, Jimmy O'Brien, Jordan Larmour and Paddy McCarthy haven't been considered due to injury, as well as Ulster's Cormac Izuchukwu, Munster's Calvin Nash, and Connacht's Shayne Bolton and Mack Hansen.

BTC joined a broader risk-asset bounce near the Wall Street open, while Trump’s World Economic Forum comments revived expectations for US crypto market-structure reform. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) sought a $90,000 reclaim around Wednesday’s Wall Street open as US President Donald Trump pledged to sign pro-crypto legislation. Key points: Trump breathes modest gains into BTC price action with his World Economic Forum speech. Pro-crypto legislation is back on the table in the US, but Japanese bond issues temper market enthusiasm. Bitcoin setting new 2026 lows may be “good” in the long term, according to analysis. Data from TradingView showed daily BTC price gains reaching 1.7% as Trump took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “To unleash innovation and savings and financing I’m also working to ensure America remains the crypto capital of the world, and to that end I signed the landmark Genius Act into law,” Trump said. Special Address by Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), President of the United States of America (@POTUS @whitehouse) with @borgebrende and Laurence D. Fink (@BlackRock) #WEF26 https://t.co/k0rVz5zK8J Trump also said that he would not use force to take over Greenland, a topic that stock markets welcomed, with the S&P 500 up 0.5% at the time of writing. “That stock market is going to be doubled,” he added about the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Trump’s words came as markets waited to see the full extent of EU trade retaliation over the Greenland issue. Across the world, Japanese bond markets, a topic to which crypto markets are traditionally sensitive, once more hit the headlines. “After decades of near-zero rates, 10-year Japanese bond yields have risen to around 2.29%, levels not seen since 1999,” trading company QCP Capital wrote on the topic in its latest Asia Color market update. “This shift is exposing deep fiscal vulnerabilities: government debt now exceeds ~240% of GDP, total debt stands near ¥1,342tn, and debt servicing is projected to absorb roughly a quarter of fiscal spending in 2026,” QPC Capital wrote, adding: Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter warned that Japanese government bond demand was “crashing.” “Japan's bond market crisis is deepening,” it wrote in an X post on the day. Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on round-trip BTC price action in January that took BTC/USD close to its 2026 starting position. Related: Bitcoin sharks scoop up BTC like it's 2013 despite 'perfect bull trap' In so doing, it closed a “gap” in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market, leaving only gaps above price and a potential foundation for a sustained rebound. “$BTC has a solid buying wall. This shows that the support line is strong,” trader CW reported. Daan Crypto Trades advised monitoring the local lows, arguing that it would even be beneficial for BTC/USD to “wick below” the 2026 opening mark. $BTC Almost retested the yearly open on this flush lower.Still think that's a good area to watch closely. In my opinion, it would be good to have a bit of a wick below the yearly open so that it is at least taken out.Then from there we can see. https://t.co/YdmvnbZpio pic.twitter.com/tIFG3nWVdQ This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Title: Trump Seeks Immediate Negotiations for Greenland, Prosecutions for ‘Rigged’ 2020 Election in Davos Speech | Video

“What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located, that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection. It’s a very small ask,” the president tells the World Economic Forum President Donald Trump reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland during his special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, arguing the territory is vital for U.S. national security and vowing to build a Golden Dome missile defense shield on it. “All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he said. “What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located, that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection. It’s a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades. But the problem with NATO is that we’ll be there for them 100%, but I’m not sure that they’d be there for us if we gave them the call.” Trump’s long, rambling speech before world leaders and the global business elite hit on familiar gripes, like windmills and the “crooked” news media, and featured a flurry of boasts. But the most anticipated part of it revolved around Greenland given Trump’s stated ambitions for the U.S. to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory. (Trump also mentioned “Iceland” several times when he presumably meant Greenland.) “All we want from Denmark for national and international security and to keep our very energetic and dangerous potential enemies at bay is this land on which we’re going to build the greatest Golden Dome ever built. We’re building a Golden Dome that’s going to, just by its very nature, going to be defending Canada,” Trump added. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way, they should be grateful also, but they’re not. I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn’t so grateful. They should be grateful to U.S., Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark [Carney], the next time you make your statements.” Trump’s reference to Carney follows the Canadian prime minister’s stirring speech one day earlier, in which he spoke of a global “rupture,” in which “the rules-based order is fading,” and “the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.” Carney called for “the middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.” In Wednesday’s speech, Trump said he had “tremendous respect for both the people of Greenland and the people of Denmark,” but “every NATO ally has an obligation to be able to defend their own territory.” He suggested the U.S. is the only nation that can secure Greenland. “We’re a great power, much greater than people even understand. I think they found that out two weeks ago in Venezuela. We saw this in World War II, when Denmark fell to Germany after just six hours of fighting and was totally unable to defend either itself or Greenland,” he said. “So the United States was then compelled. We did it. We felt an obligation to do it, to send our own forces to hold the Greenland territory and hold it. We did at great cost and expense. They didn’t have a chance of getting on it, and they tried.” “So they have a choice: You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember,” Trump said. Elsewhere in his 80-minute speech, the president falsely claimed the 2020 election, which he lost decisively to Joe Biden, was “rigged” and promised prosecutions to come. “It was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. It’s probably breaking news, but it should be. It was a rigged election. Can’t have rigged elections. You need strong borders, strong elections and ideally a good press,” Trump said. But the news media, he said, is “terrible,” “very crooked” and “very biased.” He said that “some day it’ll straighten out because it’s losing all credibility.” After being introduced as “the most important leader in the world” by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the United States president recapped the first year of his second term, complete with references to “Sleepy” Joe Biden, a failing Europe, the Radical Left, international tariffs, Chinese windmills, Los Angeles and Minnesota. At one point, he took a shot at Rep. Ilhan Omar, who he called a “fake Congressperson” from “a country that’s not a country.” Omar was born in war-torn Somalia and her family immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s, eventually settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Trump also touted an executive order “banning large institutional investors from buying single family homes,” capping credit card interest rates at 10% and keeping AI advancement in the United States. “We should be paying the lowest interest rate of everybody. Without us, most of the countries don’t even work. And then you have the protection factor. Without our military, which is the greatest in the world by far, without our military, you have threats that you wouldn’t believe,” he stated. “You don’t have threats because of us. That’s because of NATO.” “Some of you are the greatest leaders anywhere in the world. You’re the greatest brains anywhere in the world,” he concluded. “The future is unlimited and to a large part, because of you, and we have to protect you and we have to cherish you. I always say we have to cherish our brilliant people, because there aren’t many of them.”

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2026 6:42:25 AM PST by MtnClimber A large U.S. delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio are traveling with President Trump tonight to Davos. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and all of the key members of the cabinet are already there. According to the official WEF schedule, President Donald Trump’s address is in the mid‑afternoon Wednesday January 21, with the Davos session set for 2:30 to 3:15 p.m. local time (8:30 to 9:15 a.m. ET). The entire world will be watching this speech considering the geopolitical events of the past year, the current trajectory of global relationships that has been scrambled by President Trump, and anticipation of this moment being the inflection point in Western political history. On the tech side, all of the information bots under the control of Canada, the U.K, Australia and the global intelligence apparatus will be turned on to control and shape internet opinion of President Trump’s speech. The need for control is a reaction to fear. Do not discount the stakes at play; this is beyond the trillions – this is everything. For the opposition to President Trump this is a zero-sum conflict. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent held a press conference earlier today to absorb and address some of the key questions from the international media assembly [Bessent video at link]. Combined with feedback from Secretary Lutnick and USTR Greer, the speech content is being finalized on the flight between President Trump and Secretary Rubio. Trump’s Davos schedule, via the White House.

January 21, 2026 08:30 ET | Source: Deal Engine Deal Engine NEW YORK and LONDON, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Filament Syfter, a pioneering, category-defining dealmaking data platform that empowers private market dealmakers to unify data and unleash AI, announced today it is rebranding to Deal Engine. Since 2016, the company has partnered with private equity and investment banking firms to overcome a perennial private markets challenge: UI fatigue from fragmented data across multiple sources that limits deal flow, insight, and action. This new corporate identity both nods to the company’s deep expertise in private markets Data Engineering and celebrates their productization of and rapid response to the industry’s demand for data engines. Private equity firms have spent the last decade adopting new workflows and introducing new data streams, but now struggle to unify the firm’s data ecosystem. The reality of today’s fast-paced dealmaking environment is that a firm requires access to world-class data sources from leading providers, the firm’s own CRM and document management data and intelligence, and unstructured public information from websites, external news, RSS feeds, social media, events, and other sources in a moment’s notice. Deal Engine’s platform not only brings all this data together, it enables AI to automatically locate and validate deal intelligence on the firm’s behalf, in accordance with all the investment theses across the platform and portfolio. Phil Westcott, CEO and Founder of Deal Engine, shared, “We saw early that private equity firms were struggling to harness AI for their deal sourcing and market coverage. The challenge typically comes down to data engineering—our forte. With 10 years of PE data engineering experience, we’ve productized the architecture and tooling that dramatically accelerates the build, training, and deployment of proprietary data engines in a fraction of the time taken for a self-build. Our new name, Deal Engine, is a bold statement of intent, announcing ourselves as the category pioneer, the market leader in PE data engines.” The firm was founded by Westcott, a former Director of IBM Watson, and a world-class team of data engineers, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and large language model (LLM) professionals all dedicated to the challenges of private market data.​ At the heart of Deal Engine is its ability to: Deal Engine is helping firms source deals both on and off-market. The technology supports dealmakers to build conviction on a target while nurturing relationships and accelerating deal progression. Their top tier private equity clients are also benefiting from market monitoring of intermediaries, portfolio companies and LPs, enabling all private equity roles to gain a competitive advantage in the market. Deal Engine’s Recent MilestonesExcitement and interest in the company’s business model have grown, following a $4.8M Series A funding round led by FINTOP Capital last summer. The firm has quietly become an indispensable partner to a host of leading firms in the US, Europe and Asia. While some prefer to keep their underlying tech a secret to the market, notable named clients include Astorg, Inflexion, and Cavendish. The sense of mystery has led to some industry commentators describing Deal Engine as the "best kept secret in PE." As part of the firm’s enterprise growth, it has opened a New York office and hired two senior sales leads in North America - Alex Bajdechi as Global VP of Sales and Steve Kolatec, Senior Sales Executive, North America - both with extensive industry experience at firms such as Preqin, Intapp/DealCloud, Salesforce, and BlackRock to help it scale quickly with private equity firms and investment banks in North America. It is also investing in amplifying its product, research and development, marketing, and communications profile with paid media, print, video content development, webinars, and event sponsorships. About Deal Engine (formerly Filament Syfter)Deal Engine is the first and only leading dealmaking data engine provider, purpose-built for private markets dealmakers. This new technology enables firms to centralize, enrich, and institutionalize market, proprietary and public data. Increase dealmaker efficacy, improve resource allocation, enhance relationships, and originate the best-fit deals across platform investments and a firm’s portfolio with Deal Engine.

Title: Microsoft CEO says AI needs to have a wider impact or else it risks quickly losing ‘social permission’ — also says that the technology should benefit more people to avoid a bubble

Satya Nadella talked about how AI should benefit people and how it can avoid a bubble. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview during the 2026 World Economic Forum annual meeting that artificial intelligence needs to have a wider impact or else it risks losing “social permission,” especially given the amount of energy and other resources that AI data centers consume. Nadella made this comment during his talk with Laurance D. Fink, CEO and chairperson of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, that has been shared on YouTube. The two company heads were talking about AI diffusion, with Fink asking, “Can you describe how this process of diffusion across economies, across companies, across people, and countries? How does that play out?” “The zeitgeist is a little bit about the admiration for AI in its abstract form or as technology. But I think we, as a global community, have to get to a point where we are using it to do something that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,” Nadella said. “Otherwise, I don’t think this makes much sense, right? In fact, I would say we will quickly lose even the social permission to actually take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness across all sectors, small and large. And that, to me, is ultimately the goal.” The rush to build AI infrastructure is putting a strain on many different resources. For example, we’re in the middle of a memory chip shortage because of the massive demand for HBM that AI GPUs require. It’s estimated that data centers will consume 70% of memory chips made this year, with the shortage going beyond RAM modules and SSDs and starting to affect other components and products like GPUs and smartphones. There’s also the increased demand for electricity, which is causing prices to spike by 36% in some states and wholesale prices to soar by up to 267% over the past 5 years. The high-performance AI processors in data centers also require a lot of water for cooling, with AI data centers reportedly using more water than the amount of bottled water people drank globally in one year. It has gotten to a point that U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have taken notice, with Democratic Senators demanding an explanation from big tech companies about their energy usage and President Donald Trump telling AI tech companies to “pay their own way” when it comes to their electricity consumption. Microsoft is actually taking steps to make its AI data centers more palatable to its neighbors with its “Community-First AI Infrastructure” framework, and OpenAI has also followed suit. However, it is still an open question whether other hyperscalers will follow suit. Aside from talking about the impact of AI on people, the two industry leaders also covered the AI bubble. Many industry leaders and institutions are warning about an AI bubble, especially as tech companies are continually pouring money into its development while only seeing limited benefits. “For this not to be a bubble, by definition, it requires that the benefits of this [technology] are much more evenly spread. I mean, I think, a tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” said the Microsoft chief. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side, then it’s just purely supply side.” He then gave an example of how AI tech is being used in the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs, wherein it was used to accelerate the clinical trial. Nadella even emphasized that AI wasn’t used to discover the “magical molecule” — instead, it was used for all the other things needed “to make something much more relevant.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “That’s why I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world — not just economic growth driven by capital expenses.” Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.

Posted on 01/21/2026 5:11:02 AM PST by Navy Patriot European opposition ⁠to President Donald Trump's bid to acquire Greenland and his proposed "Board of Peace" initiative has disrupted plans for an economic support package for postwar Ukraine, the Financial Times reported ‍on Wednesday. A planned announcement of an $800 billion prosperity ‍plan to be agreed between Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. at the World Economic Forum ⁠in Davos this week has been delayed, the report said, citing six officials. Reuters could not immediately verify ​the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "Nobody is in any mood to stage ‍a grand spectacle around an agreement with Trump right now," ⁠one official told the FT, adding that disputes over Greenland and the Board of Peace had overtaken an earlier focus on Ukraine at the Davos meeting. Tensions over Greenland disrupted ⁠negotiations on the prosperity ​plan text this ⁠week, the FT report said, adding that the U.S. did not send ‍a representative to a key meeting on Monday evening. The "prosperity plan" was not ‌being shelved indefinitely and could still be signed at a later date, the newspaper added. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ⁠said on ​Tuesday that he would ‍travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a ‍prosperity plan were ready to be signed there.

That number is now about $18 billion. The EU promise of money has to cover that, with most of the rest of that committed promise earmarked for purchase of weapons from European firms, not American firms, assuming those European firms can actually build the weapons without access to neodymium magnets. The second somewhat surprising money event has to do with Russia moving all of its foreign reserves into gold. This happened over the course of 2025 so the advance in gold has generated substantial profit. As of December 2025 evaluation is on the order of 320 billion dollars in Russian gold reserves. This exceeds the assets currently frozen by European factions. 11 posted on 01/21/2026 5:39:57 AM PST by Owen [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: Navy Patriot; bert; tlozo As Trump said: Russia is losing soldiers at an unprecedented level, 17 to 1. Ukraine just got 90 billion from the EU. Therefore it can continue the war for many more years. RUssia is trapped in a quagmire of its own making and barely survives thanks to massive Chinese subsidies and thousands of Communist North Korean troops. Russia’s gold reserves are now being progressively sold. Its economy was supposed to steam at 4.5%.... but it’s down to 1.1% instead (growth) and it’s still going down into a stagflation or recession... we’ll know shortly. Ukraine is destroying Russia’s refinery infrastructure, blackouts in Moscow many times this last month. Ukraine know has Europe’s most potent army. Russia can only aim at civilians in Ukraine. It doesn’t seem capable of doing anything more... while its army gets decimated. 12 posted on 01/21/2026 5:48:13 AM PST by USA-FRANCE (Silence against evil isn't neutrality, it's complicity.

Ther are a multiplicity of factors (some foreign; some domestic) that can make treaties inoperable. 19 posted on 01/21/2026 6:15:16 AM PST by Ozymandias Ghost [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: USA-FRANCE Quite likely, Russia’s biggest problem is the direct sanctions Trump slapped on Russian oil companies, abetted by seizures of ships with improper registries, former dealings with Iran, etc. Plus, there’s the global oil glut, with many tankers, legit and not, being used for floating storage. Charter rates for tankers carrying Russian oil have gone through the roof, and if the ship is just sitting as storage somewhere, that’s disastrous. Russian oil exports (actual deliveries) were down to 3.6 million bpd last month (their figures) and the effective price (less transport costs) has dropped to near $35 / barrel. Not always recognized in the nominal figures one can look up online is that buyers have to pay the cost of the oil plus transport costs: If transport costs a fortune, the nominal oil price gets discounted at some point, so the total is still competitive. The charter companies are grinning ear to ear. If people think the defense companies are making a nice profit... Russia is still stealing gold out of Sudan, so they have some income there. Our USS Lincoln strike force, a couple days away from the ME, has itself gone dark — it seems increasingly likely Trump is going to whack Iran after all. I’d think that included in that will be pasting drone and missile facilities and storage, plus launchers, in addition to decapitation strikes. The Ukies will shed no tears. OTOH, Russia’s attempt to freeze out Kyiv and other major Ukie cities (meets the definition of genocide) has been somewhat effective. The Ukies have responded and caused blackouts scattered around in western Russia, but Ukraine does not have nearly enough capacity to create lengthy large scale outages, as Russia has. Ukraine badly needs about $15 billion in electric power generators to create a very widely dispersed source for electricity, to replace much of their grid. I’m a bit surprised that Ukraine’s supporters in the US House and Senate have not proposed a “matching supply” program for generators, with Europe. Ie., we match the amount of generation Europe donates. Trump would look really bad in the eyes of most US voters to veto such a bill. 20 posted on 01/21/2026 6:25:29 AM PST by Paul R.

That number is now about $18 billion. The EU promise of money has to cover that, with most of the rest of that committed promise earmarked for purchase of weapons from European firms, not American firms, assuming those European firms can actually build the weapons without access to neodymium magnets. The second somewhat surprising money event has to do with Russia moving all of its foreign reserves into gold. This happened over the course of 2025 so the advance in gold has generated substantial profit. As of December 2025 evaluation is on the order of 320 billion dollars in Russian gold reserves. This exceeds the assets currently frozen by European factions. 11 posted on 01/21/2026 5:39:57 AM PST by Owen [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: Navy Patriot; bert; tlozo As Trump said: Russia is losing soldiers at an unprecedented level, 17 to 1. Ukraine just got 90 billion from the EU. Therefore it can continue the war for many more years. RUssia is trapped in a quagmire of its own making and barely survives thanks to massive Chinese subsidies and thousands of Communist North Korean troops. Russia’s gold reserves are now being progressively sold. Its economy was supposed to steam at 4.5%.... but it’s down to 1.1% instead (growth) and it’s still going down into a stagflation or recession... we’ll know shortly. Ukraine is destroying Russia’s refinery infrastructure, blackouts in Moscow many times this last month. Ukraine know has Europe’s most potent army. Russia can only aim at civilians in Ukraine.

Charter rates for tankers carrying Russian oil have gone through the roof, and if the ship is just sitting as storage somewhere, that’s disastrous. Russian oil exports (actual deliveries) were down to 3.6 million bpd last month (their figures) and the effective price (less transport costs) has dropped to near $35 / barrel. Not always recognized in the nominal figures one can look up online is that buyers have to pay the cost of the oil plus transport costs: If transport costs a fortune, the nominal oil price gets discounted at some point, so the total is still competitive. The charter companies are grinning ear to ear. If people think the defense companies are making a nice profit... Russia is still stealing gold out of Sudan, so they have some income there. Our USS Lincoln strike force, a couple days away from the ME, has itself gone dark — it seems increasingly likely Trump is going to whack Iran after all. I’d think that included in that will be pasting drone and missile facilities and storage, plus launchers, in addition to decapitation strikes. The Ukies will shed no tears. OTOH, Russia’s attempt to freeze out Kyiv and other major Ukie cities (meets the definition of genocide) has been somewhat effective. The Ukies have responded and caused blackouts scattered around in western Russia, but Ukraine does not have nearly enough capacity to create lengthy large scale outages, as Russia has. Ukraine badly needs about $15 billion in electric power generators to create a very widely dispersed source for electricity, to replace much of their grid. I’m a bit surprised that Ukraine’s supporters in the US House and Senate have not proposed a “matching supply” program for generators, with Europe. Ie., we match the amount of generation Europe donates. Trump would look really bad in the eyes of most US voters to veto such a bill. 20 posted on 01/21/2026 6:25:29 AM PST by Paul R.

Title: “Largest Infrastructure Buildout In Human History”: Jensen Huang on AI’s “Five-Layer Cake” at Davos
URL: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/davos-wef-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-jensen-huang/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T12:50:16Z
Full Content:
From skilled trades to startups, AI’s rapid expansion is the beginning of the next massive computing platform shift, and for the world’s workforce, a move from tasks to purpose. At a packed mainstage session at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang described artificial intelligence as the foundation of what he called “the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” driving job creation across the global economy. Speaking with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Huang framed AI not as a single technology but as a “a five-layer cake,” spanning energy, chips and computing infrastructure, cloud data centers, AI models and, ultimately, the application layer. Because every layer of AI’s five-layer stack must be built and operated, Huang said the platform shift is creating jobs across the economy — from energy and construction to advanced manufacturing, cloud operations and application development. The application layer might focus on integrating AI into financial services, healthcare or manufacturing. “This layer on top, ultimately, is where economic benefit will happen,” Huang said. From energy and power generation to chip manufacturing, data center construction and cloud operations, Huang said the AI buildout is already creating demand for skilled labor. He added that the largest economic benefit will come from the application layer, where AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and financial services — and changing the nature of work across the economy. Huang pointed to venture capital investment as a signal of how quickly AI is reshaping the global economy. He said 2025 was one of the largest years for VC funding on record, with most of that capital flowing to what he described as “AI-native companies.” These firms span healthcare, robotics, manufacturing and financial services — industries where, Huang said, “for the first time, the models are good enough to build on top of.” That investment, Huang said, is translating directly into jobs. He highlighted demand for plumbers, electricians, construction workers, steelworkers, network technicians and teams responsible for installing and operating advanced equipment. AI, Huang said, likely won’t destroy jobs. Instead, it’s increasing demand in fields such as radiology, and helping handle administrative work in fields impacted by labor shortages — such as nursing. AI has become a key tool in radiology, he said, yet there are now more radiologists than ever. “If you reason from first principles, not surprisingly, the number of radiologists has gone up,” Huang said. He explained that the purpose of a radiologist’s job is to diagnose disease and help patients, while studying scans is just one task. “The fact that they’re able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients,” he said, adding that AI enables greater interaction with patients and other clinicians. And because they can also see more patients, there’s a need for more radiologists. Huang said the same dynamic is playing out in nursing. The U.S. faces a shortage of roughly 5 million nurses, in part because nurses spend nearly half their time on charting and documentation. “Now they can use AI to do the charting and the transcription of patient visits,” he said, pointing to work being done by companies such as Abridge and its partners. As productivity improves, Huang said, outcomes improve as well. “Hospitals do better, and they hire more nurses,” he said. “Surprisingly — or not surprisingly — AI is increasing productivity and, as a result, hospitals want to hire more people.” To illustrate the broader point, Huang joked that if someone simply watched him and Fink doing their jobs, “you would probably think the two of us are typists.” Automating typing, he said, would not eliminate their jobs because that task is not their purpose. AI helps with tasks, enabling people to fulfill their purpose and become more productive, making workers more valuable. “So the question is, what is the purpose of your job?” Huang said. Huang framed AI as essential national infrastructure. “AI is infrastructure,” he said, arguing that every country should treat AI like electricity or roads. “You should have AI as part of your infrastructure.” He urged countries to build their own AI capabilities, drawing on local language and culture. “Develop your AI, continue to refine it and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem,” he said. Fink asked whether only the most educated people can use or benefit from AI. Huang countered that idea, emphasizing that AI’s rapid adoption stems from its accessibility. “AI is super easy to use — it’s the easiest software to use in history,” he said, noting that in just two to three years, AI tools have reached nearly a billion people. As a result, Huang said AI literacy is becoming essential. “It is very clear that it is essential to learn how to use AI — how to direct it, manage it, guardrail it, evaluate it,” he said, comparing those skills to leadership and people management. For developing countries, Huang said AI offers a chance to narrow long-standing technology gaps. “AI is likely to close the technology divide,” he said, citing its accessibility and abundance. Turning to Europe, Huang highlighted manufacturing and industrial strength as a major advantage. “You don’t write AI — you teach AI,” he said, urging countries to fuse industrial capability with artificial intelligence to unlock physical AI and robotics. “Robotics is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” he said, particularly for nations with strong industrial bases. Fink summarized the discussion by saying that what he heard suggested the world is far from an AI bubble. Instead, he posed a different question: Are we investing enough? Huang agreed, saying large investments are required because “we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.” The opportunity, he said, “is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved.” He reiterated that 2025 was the largest year for global VC investment, with more than $100 billion deployed worldwide, most of it into AI-native startups. “These companies are building the application layer above,” Huang said, “and they’re going to need infrastructure — and investment — to build this future.” Fink added that broad participation in that growth is critical. “I actually believe it’s going to be a great investment for pension funds around the world to be a part of that, to grow with this AI world,” Fink said. “We need to make sure that the average pensioner and the average saver is part of that growth. If they’re just watching it from the sidelines, they’re going to feel left out.” Featured image courtesy of World Economic Forum.

The great and good from the worlds of business and politics are meeting this week in the Swiss mountain top resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum. Donald Trump’s tough stance on Greenland, threatening tariffs on eight European countries has overshadowed the whole event and he is due to speak there in the late afternoon on Wednesday. If Larry Fink has his way, this might be one of the last times that Davos hosts the WEF jamboree, having been its home since its foundation in 1971. In a blog post that caught delegates off guard, Fink, BlackRock chair and interim co-chair of the WEF’s governing board, suggested moving the summit permanently from Davos or using venues on a rotational basis. And among the locations discussed was none other than Dublin. According to the Financial Times, Fink wants to reshape the forum, which has been widely criticised as too elitist and out of touch. The WEF should “start doing something new: showing up – and listening – in the places where the modern world is actually built”, Fink said in his blog post. [ Dublin in running as World Economic Forum weighs moving flagship event from DavosOpens in new window ] “Davos, yes. But also places like Detroit and Dublin – and cities like Jakarta and Buenos Aires.” The prospect of WEF coming to Dublin would have tourism chiefs and hospitality owners here rubbing their hands. It would be quite a coup for the city were it to happen, albeit it would come at a high cost. Could Dublin realistically host WEF? Davos is a small resort, with limited accommodation. Many of those attending WEF have to stay in neighbouring towns and cities and face long commutes each day. Web Summit quit our capital city a decade ago, citing infrastructure constraints among its reasons for decamping to Lisbon (there was, of course, also the small matter of huge financial incentives offered by the Portuguese authorities). Some 3,000 delegates attend Davos, including 120 political leaders. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. About 5,000 Swiss army personnel are committed to the event, along with local and canton police officers. There is also a battalion of media, a large contingent of private security operatives, along with catering workers and others who staff the event. It’s a huge logistical operation. Easily 10,000-plus people across the week. On paper, Dublin could accommodate the event. There are about 25,000 hotel bedrooms in Dublin, which in January would have an occupancy level of around 70 per cent, according to hospitality sources. So that’s 7,500 spare rooms normally. According to its website, the Convention Centre Dublin can host just shy of 3,600 delegates theatre-style in its ground floor forum space and it has 22 rooms that could accommodate media, and various panels and break out sessions. However, that’s only part of the story. Davos essentially goes into lockdown for the duration of the event, with tight restrictions on access to the resort. Closing off one side of Dublin’s quays for a week would paralyse the city’s traffic and severely compromise access to the port. Then there’s the high-level security operation required for political leaders. The Swiss military is years ahead of Ireland in terms of its ability to manage such a vast operation. Ireland would also no doubt have to write a big cheque to secure Davos for Dublin. The WEF’s brand is tightly tied to Davos and the original rationale for hosting it high in the Alps was to get leaders out of their bubbles and away from the masses. That was an age before the internet and the extensive transport and telecoms connectivity that now exists in our always-on society. The Swiss will be loath to give it up. So the odds of in moving out of Davos, never mind relocating to Dublin, are low. But if Millstreet can host the Eurovision anything is possible.

Title: Nvidia's Jensen Huang says it's a good time to be a plumber — and not just because it's an AI-proof job

Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it was a great time to be a tradesperson because the AI boom is creating demand for manual labor to build data centers. "It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers," he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Davos, Switzerland. Huang described the AI boom as the "largest infrastructure buildout in human history" that would create "a lot of jobs." AI's impact on the labor market has been a hot topic at Davos this year. Huang has long argued that AI won't be the mass job killer some believe it will be. He has given radiology as an example: while AI has automated some of the tasks radiologists do, the number of jobs in the field has actually increased. AI "Godfather" Geoffrey Hinton previously said he also believes manual labor is safer from AI, though for a different reason: it will take longer for AI to have the dexterity to take on more physical jobs. At Davos on Wednesday, Huang said the US was seeing a "significant boom" in demand for manual jobs helping build AI infrastructure, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. "So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that," said Huang. He added: "Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so." Jump to

Title: KeyCorp names new lead independent director

Let Banking Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Two other board members will retire at the bank’s annual meeting. Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management sought board changes, among other demands, in a presentation last month. KeyCorp said Tuesday it will make several changes to its board, roughly six weeks after an activist investor criticized its performance and called for CEO Chris Gorman’s firing. KeyCorp appointed Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos as the bank’s lead independent director and said directors Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis will retire at the bank’s annual meeting on May 14. Vasos succeeds Alexander M. “Sandy” Cutler, who as lead independent director for 10 years and board member since 2000, helped KeyCorp navigate “periods of significant industry change,” according to Gorman. Vasos joined KeyCorp as a director in 2020. Cutler will continue to serve as an independent director. Last month, activist investor HoldCo Asset Management, which took a $140 million stake in KeyCorp, alleged that Cutler “has overseen tremendous underperformance over the past 25 years and has watched the dilution tax play out again and again and again.” HoldCo also asserted that “every single director” at KeyCorp “has objectively failed their constituents.” To replace Highsmith and Gillis, KeyCorp has nominated BlackRock veteran Antonio DeSpirito and Truist vet Christopher Henson. “Tony and Chris are outstanding additions whose experience and capabilities are directly aligned with KeyCorp's priorities,” Gorman said in a prepared statement. “They bring expertise across capital markets, banking operations and financial oversight, as well as track records of value creation.” DeSpirito served as BlackRock’s global chief investment officer for fundamental equities. Henson retired from Truist in 2021 as head of banking and insurance. He previously served as president, chief operating officer and CFO of the North Carolina-based lender’s predecessor, BB&T. The nominees will support the bank in its pursuit to “execute its strategy to drive disciplined growth, enhanced profitability and shareholder value,” Gorman added. A KeyCorp spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry into whether the changes were a direct response to HoldCo’s December presentation. “[T]his reaffirms the Board’s commitment to strong corporate governance and long-term shareholder value creation,” the spokesperson said, echoing words from the press release. HoldCo also declined to comment on the changes. The activist investor has been persistent in efforts to shake up the banking sector of late. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based firm urged Comerica last July to sell. When the Texas lender said it would be acquired by Fifth Third in October, HoldCo took issue with the deal and sued both Comerica and Fifth Third. That deal nabbed its final regulatory approval last week.
