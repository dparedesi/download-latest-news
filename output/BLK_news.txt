The dominance of Nakamoto’s holdings faces potential disruption as Bitcoin ETFs continue their rapid accumulation. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has emerged as a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, now holding over 500,000 BTC and securing its position as the third-largest Bitcoin holder globally. With holdings valued at approximately $48 billion, BlackRock has acquired 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply in just 233 trading days since IBIT’s launch. By offering an exchange-traded product (ETP), BlackRock has provided investors with streamlined access to BTC, bypassing the complexities of direct ownership and reinforcing its commitment to advancing institutional Bitcoin adoption. As expected, Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin, remains the largest individual holder of the cryptocurrency, with an impressive 1.096 million BTC—equating to 5.22% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. However, the dominance of Nakamoto’s holdings faces potential disruption as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their rapid accumulation. These funds, which already surpassed MicroStrategy’s holdings earlier this year, are now just 13,000 BTC away from matching Nakamoto’s monumental stash. Source: James Van Straten/X This race underscores the growing influence of institutional investors in reshaping the Bitcoin landscape. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly closing in on a significant milestone, with total holdings reaching 1.083 million BTC after a $353.67 million inflow on 2nd December, according to Sosovalue. In fact, as of the latest update from Farside Investors, BTC ETF saw inflows worth $676 million on 3rd December. Thus, to match Nakamoto’s 1.1 million BTC holdings, these ETFs would require an additional $1.23 billion inflow at current market prices. Sosovalue data further highlights that, aside from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), all other spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded positive cumulative inflows as of 2nd December as on 3rd December GBTC received zero flows. However, while optimism surrounds the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, critics within the crypto community voice concerns over potential centralization. They argue that entities like BlackRock, with its rapidly growing Bitcoin holdings, could undermine the very principles of decentralization that BTC was founded upon. Designed to empower individuals and reduce reliance on centralized control, the rise of institutional dominance is seen by some as a contradiction to Bitcoin’s ethos, raising questions about the long-term implications for the cryptocurrency’s foundational values. For instance, one user on X noted, “There once was a dream that was Bitcoin… this is not it,” Additionally, the latest filings by BitcoinTreasuries data show a dynamic shift in Bitcoin holdings among major corporate players. While MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 402,100 BTC following its recent $1.5 billion purchase funded by share sales, institutional ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT are surpassing corporate treasuries in Bitcoin accumulation. Meanwhile, crypto miner MARA Holdings has solidified its position as the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, amassing 34,794 BTC after acquiring 6,484 tokens for $618.3 million in recent months. This growing competition highlights the accelerating adoption of BTC among both institutional investors and corporate entities. Amidst the ongoing buzz, Bitcoin was trading at $96,635.38 after a hike of 1.35% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap.

Title: Republicans’ War on ESG Has Reached New Heights of Stupidity
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/188985/ken-paxton-vanguard-blackrock-state-street-esg-climate
Time Published: 2024-12-04T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
Eleven Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, are suing three of the world’s biggest asset managers. Blackrock, State Street, and Vanguard, Paxton’s office claims, are engaged in a “conspiracy” to “artificially constrict the market for coal through anticompetitive trade practices.” The Republicans’ case seems to hinge on the fact that these three financial firms were at one point members of Climate Action 100+ and Net-Zero Asset Managers, “investor-led” initiatives meant to align corporations behind a somewhat vague set of commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The push is part of a yearslong effort by the GOP to target environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, investment criteria. The GOP claims that these have been a vehicle for major financial institutions to push woke, green agendas through stock ownership. In this case, the attorneys general contend that the asset managers have deliberately acquired large shares in publicly traded coal companies and then used their “combined influence over the coal market” to exert anticompetitive pressure in order to simultaneously “accommodate ‘green energy’ goals” and drive up coal prices, allowing them to see “extraordinary revenue gains.” It’s a wild claim on a few fronts. Coal usage has been steadily declining in the United States for well over a decade. From 2000 through 2010, coal accounted for an average of 48.6 percent of U.S. electricity generation. The last year it was above 40 percent was in 2011. Coal generation declined steadily—by about 10,000 megawatts per year—through 2020, per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As the Covid-19 pandemic set in that year, coal was fueling just 20 percent of U.S. electricity generation; this year, it provided only around 16 percent of power here. Coal production has rapidly declined over the same time period. In 2014, the U.S. produced more than one billion short tons of coal. Last year, it produced 578 million. Those declines are due largely to the shale boom, wherein cheap methane gas was able to replace coal on the grid throughout most of the country. Those trends have been especially dramatic in Texas, which is also a leading wind producer. Last year, Texas got just 13 percent of its power from coal; 22 percent came from wind and 51 percent from gas. The three financial firms Paxton is suing, moreover, have never given the impression of being all that committed to environmental goals: Vanguard withdrew from the Net-Zero Asset Managers alliance in 2022 and was never a member of Climate Action 100+. State Street left C100+ in February, and Blackrock transferred its membership in that initiative to a smaller international arm after the alliance announced that members would need to ramp up corporate disclosures and take some actions to actually reduce emissions. It’s a losing battle to try to point out all the incoherence here. Anti-ESG crusaders argued that asset managers like Blackrock were “discriminating” against oil and gas companies while those same companies enjoyed record profits and as domestic oil and gas production hit record highs. If the financial sector is orchestrating a vast conspiracy to undermine the fossil fuel industry, it doesn’t seem to be going very well. Whether any Republican elected officials actually believe that to be the case is basically irrelevant, though. As the next Trump administration prepares to take over, the GOP is presumably hoping to use the Justice Department and the many other new tools at its disposal to defend the fossil fuel industry against its supposed enemies on Wall Street, long-standing market trends, and even itself. Cases like this one are just more grist for the mill—however little sense they make. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Bitwise outflows offset by BlackRock and Fidelity's contributions, totaling $1.03 billion in December ETF. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted over $1 billion in inflows during the early days of December, according to recent Farside data. On Dec. 2, BlackRock led with $338.3 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity with $25.1 million. Total inflows for that day reached $353.6 million. The following day, Dec. 3, saw increased activity. BlackRock’s ETF recorded $693.3 million in inflows, while Fidelity added $52.2 million. Despite Bitwise experiencing outflows of $93.5 million, total inflows amounted to $676 million. Cumulatively, Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $1.03 billion in inflows for December so far, bringing total assets under management to approximately $31.7 billion. Major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others are contributing significantly to this surge. This influx coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price rally, which is again threatening the $100,000 mark, currently sitting around $97,000.

Title: Detached home by the sea in Blackrock for €1.25m

There are a couple of options available to prospective buyers of Carraig Rua in Blackrock. The four-bedroom detached house was originally built in 1986 to include a dental practice and private residence. The owners lived and worked here until they retired about three years ago. The house has since been fully renovated and is now laid out as a home with no evidence of the surgery. However, it still has planning permission in place for a medical or dental practice on the ground floor. This makes it an interesting prospect for the likes of doctors, dentists, physiotherapists or psychologists who are looking to run a business from the comfort of their own home. If the potential new owners don’t intend to incorporate the medical practice, however, a change of use permission to residential-only will be required. The redbrick home comes to the market seeking €1.25 million through DNG. With a floor space of 210sq m (2,260sq ft), the property is in turnkey condition, and features bright and spacious rooms. The wide hallway allows access to all rooms on the ground floor. To the left is a bedroom with en suite bathroom, and to the right is a study and a large living/diningroom. A breakfast bar divides this living space and the long kitchen, which runs the length of the house. The bright room is lit up by a series of rooflights overhead and is fully fitted with white wall and floor units. Off the kitchen is a utility room and pantry. Upstairs there are three bedrooms, all with en suite bathrooms and one with a walk-in wardrobe. The property uses gas central heating and has a C1 Ber rating. It is located on a laneway at Temple Crescent, just off Seapoint Avenue. Over the years, more houses have been built here on sites that would have originally been the back of the larger homes on Alma Road. The original coach house wall still surrounds Carraig Rua, with some of the blacksmith’s iron hooks still attached. Set behind electric gates, the property feels private and secure. The large site is currently set in concrete to provide parking for patients, but the potential is there to landscape the generous garden to create a greener space. This area is very popular with families as schools such as Blackrock College, St Andrew’s and Rockford Manor are all close by. Seapoint, Blackrock and Monkstown are within walking distance from Carraig Rua, with the Dart station less than five minutes away on foot. The owners are sad to say goodbye to the house that was a lot more than just a home. They will especially miss their lunchtime walks down to Seapoint, but they hope that new owners will be as happy here as they were.

BlackRock has clinched its third big acquisition this year. The world’s largest asset manager is buying HPS Investment Partners in a $12 billion all stock bid to create a leading global credit manager. Private credit, which refers to non-bank firms offering loans to businesses, is one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street. BlackRock had previously said it expected the global private debt market to hit $3.5 trillion in AUM by the end of 2028. The firm updated that projection Tuesday, and now anticipates traditional private credit to more than double to over $4.5 trillion by 2030, according to an investor presentation announcing the acquisition. BlackRock’s buy of HPS, a leading global credit investment manager with $148 billion in client assets, was widely anticipated. The firm was considering an IPO earlier this year but instead opted to sell to the giant asset manager. By acquiring HPS, BlackRock expects to create a combined private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets. The deal is expected to close in mid-2025. “Blackrock has been talking about credit for some time. They might as well acquire a good firm versus trying to build one from scratch,” one industry executive said. Shares of BlackRock dropped to a 52-week low of $742.22 in December 2023 but have since rebounded. The stock on Tuesday closed at $1039, up nearly 2%. HPS co-founders Scott Kapnick, Scot French, and Michael Patterson are joining BlackRock’s global executive committee while Kapnick will also be an observer on BlackRock’s board. (Kapnick, French and Patterson are all former Goldman Sachs executives.) Founded in 2007, HPS was known as Highbridge Principal Strategies. It originally operated as a division of Highbridge Capital Management, which was part of J.P. Morgan Asset Management. In 2016, HPS principals and employees acquired the firm from Highbridge and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. HPS employs more than 760 employees, including 252 investment professionals. Seeking transformation The HPS deal is the latest acquisition for BlackRock, which has been building up its alternatives platform. CEO Larry Fink is looking to push BlackRock into the more lucrative world of private markets, which include private equity, private credit and real estate, the Wall Street Journal reported in November. In October, BlackRock closed its $12.5 billion buy of PE firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which ranks as the 20th largest global announced merger this year, according to Dealogic. BlackRock is also spending $3.2 billion to buy Preqin, a private markets data provider, that has yet to close. Since surpassing $9 trillion AUM in early 2023, BlackRock was said to be on the hunt for “transformational” opportunities. One of BlackRock’s most meaningful deals remains its $13.5 billion purchase of iShares in 2009, which is still the largest provider of ETFs, with $4.2 trillion AUM at the end of September. “[BlackRock] want to be in everything. And they have the market power to buy stuff,” one banker said. Perella Weinberg Partners and Morgan Stanley provided financial advice to BlackRock, while Peter Serating, Patrick Lewis and Laura Kaufmann Belkhayat of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, along with Clifford Chance, offered legal advice. J.P. Morgan Securities served as legal advisor to HPS while Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank Securities, BNP Paribas and RBC Capital Markets were co-financial advisors. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson acted as their legal counsel. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Martial law declared and lifted in South Korea South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared early Wednesday morning he would lift emergency martial law after the National Assembly voted to overturn Yoon's decree issued late Tuesday night. Yoon has in recent weeks clashed with the opposition party over 2025's budget. In his announcement lifting martial law, Yoon called for lawmakers to cease "budget manipulation." South Korean markets roiling South Korean markets opened lower on Wednesday after political turmoil rocked the country overnight. The Kospi was last down more than 2%. The won rebounded from earlier steep losses — it plunged to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar — but still ended the day lower against the greenback. Likewise, South Korean stocks listed in the U.S. fell before paring some losses. U.S. markets traded mixed U.S. markets were mixed on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell but the Nasdaq Composite rose. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 added 0.37%. France's CAC 40 ended the day 0.26% higher as traders assessed news that the country's Prime Minister Michel Barnier will push through a budget bill without a parliamentary vote. BlackRock expanding in private credit BlackRock will acquire HPS Investment Partners, a firm focusing on private credit investments, for $12 billion, the company announced Tuesday. The deal will position BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, better in the private credit space. HPS was planning to go public, but that move attracted BlackRock's eye, according to sources. [PRO] Scrutinizing policies more than data Ever since inflation in the U.S. shot up, the monthly jobs report, along with inflation readings, have become key pieces of economic data that swayed markets. With disinflation in progress, traders seem to be redirecting their attention to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies. December may have triggered the thawing of Mariah Carey, but stocks are beginning the month chilly. The S&P 500 was essentially flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.17%. The Nasdaq Composite, however, managed to climb 0.4%, thanks to Apple rising 1.3% for a new 52-week high. It's unlikely that stocks will remain in permafrost this month. December's historically the third-best month of the year, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The stock market may falter a little at the start of December, writes CNBC's Bob Pisani, because of tax loss selling – a phenomenon in which investors sell assets that are making a loss to reduce the tax burden on other assets making capital gains. But stocks tend to regain forward momentum as the year wraps up. "These strong returns are historically often back-end loaded," said George Smith, portfolio strategist at LPL Financial. Moreover, in presidential election years, December typically moves up one notch to become the second-best month for stocks. As Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, noted, "When the market is up 10% or more with a newly elected President, it has never gone down in the month of December." Also, investors are likely awaiting the U.S. jobs report for November, out this Friday, before making any major moves. The numbers will be the U.S. Federal Reserve's last look at the labor market before their rate-setting meeting from December 17 to 18. The markets are currently pricing in a 72.9% chance the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points at that meeting, a more optimistic bet than the 59.4% last week, according to the CME FedWatch tool. If the Fed does cut rates, that incision will probably scrape off any lingering frostbite on the stock market as well, in time for them to hear sleigh bells ringing. — CNBC's Bob Pisani, Sarah Min, Hakyung Kim, Sean Conlon, Lisa Kailai Han and Alex Harring contributed to this report.

Title: DEI is dead. The Establishment Media Just Doesn’t Want You to Know It
URL: http://www.newgeography.com/content/008377-dei-dead-the-establishment-media-just-doesn-t-want-you-know-it
Time Published: 2024-12-04T00:28:38Z
Full Content:
Even before November, the once trendy concepts of DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) were already sinking. Now the election of Donald Trump all but guarantees their accelerated decline. The DEI push gained momentum during the 2020 George Floyd riots, after being nurtured for years on most college campuses. Many companies, including Walmart, adopted its associated practices. But new research from The Conference Board indicates that over half of executives anticipate continuing the pushback of DEI initiatives. Among the firms stepping back from DEI include Boeing, John Deere, Harley-Davidson, and Black & Decker, and the biggest of all, Walmart itself. Like DEI, corporate types saw in ESG a means of expiating the sins of the past. Both draw support from cultural arbiters as well as corporate human resources departments and Left-wing non-profits like the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Open Society Foundations, and from “progressive” billionaires. Economics was sinking ESG even before the election, as its one-time promoter, BlackRock’s Larry Fink, has acknowledged. A recent analysis of major funds found that BlackRock and others who had binged on ESG have underperformed those funds not so encumbered. US sustainability funds faced their worst year on record in 2023, according to a Morningstar. The GOP takeover is sure to make things worse. Republican state legislatures – Florida, Kansas and Idaho among them – have passed laws that ban or limit the consideration of ESG, providing direct opposition to these green investment pledges. DEI is, if anything, even less favoured. The recipe of racial quotas and the systemic destruction of merit was already unpopular before Trump’s victory. Over the last two years, corporate DEI departments were slashed. One third of DEI professionals lost their jobs in 2022. The idea of racial quotas in hiring and college admissions is rejected by the vast majority of Americans and minorities. Trump is aware of this and, under the influence of activists like the Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo, could ban aid to schools that adopt DEI and quota policies. Given the extreme dependence on Washington, bloated universities will either have to cut staff or change direction. To be sure, both the green and the diversity industries will fight back. Like the “climate industrial complex”, DEI has become a business that, according to McKinsey, was worth over $7.5 billion globally in 2020. DEI’s advocates, universities in particular, will look for ways to get around new directives and court rulings. ESG is similarly threatened by the ascension of a president seeking to expand energy production, continuing the US’s profitable role as the world leader in oil and gas. Given the inevitability and continued growth of hydrocarbons, eliminating them post-haste would largely deliver the economic future to China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, and hand more power to all those lovely liberal democracies of the Middle East. Worst still, some of these policies seem to have little apparent impact on the actual climate. For its part, DEI fails because it is based on a largely false notion of the nature of America. The US is far from the “apartheid state” portrayed in schools. Instead, it is an increasingly integrated country where minorities do not automatically back their self-appointed tribunes. Nearly half of all Latinos voted for Trump, as did growing numbers of Muslims, Asians and even Black males. The whole idea that people should be judged on their degree of victimhood – gender, race, national origin – strikes most as manifestly unfair. Critically, minorities no longer cluster mostly in ghettos and barrios. In the 53 metropolitan areas with more than 1,000,000 residents, more than three-quarters of black and Hispanic residents live in racially and ethnically diverse suburbs, ranging from 20 per cent to 60 per cent non-white. Minorities are also moving away from big cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland (whose city council is demanding reparations for the very people who are exiting the inner city). In contrast, their numbers are rising in many red state metros like Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Las Vegas. Racial identity itself is changing. Elements of the Left favour segregating students, but the damned kids keep insisting on doing the opposite. Gallup has found that approval for interracial unions has risen from 4 per cent in 1958 and 50 per cent in the mid-1990s to 94 per cent today. The fastest growing race in America is mixed-race; one in ten babies born in the US have one white and one non-white parent, and 12 per cent of black Americans are now immigrants from Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. The abandonment of DEI could actually improve race relations. There is a growing literature, including a recent report from Network Contagion, that shows that DEI policies increase racial tensions rather than soothe them. Luckily for the DEI mavens, much of the establishment media refuses to cover such analyses, responding to the ideological predilections of staff at places like The New York Times and Bloomberg. The demise of DEI and ESG marks a landmark shift away from a decade of incessant virtue-signalling. The debate should now focus not on some abstract notion of “justice” but on how to make life better for working people of all ages. We can expect hysteria from eco and social justice warriors about the imminent climate catastrophes or the return to Jim Crow, slavery and anti-miscegenation laws. Yet at least for the next four years, the promoters of both ESG and DEI will be on the defensive, as Americans continue to build – on their own – the world’s most prosperous, and dynamic, multi-racial society.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Angry tradies want to rip solar panels off roofs

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Workers from SolarZero protesting outside BlackRock's Auckland office last Friday. Liquidators says it's still too early to say if there will be funds to pay secured creditors. Photo / Dean Purcell SolarZero liquidators have moved to seize solar panel stock from contract installers. “But some of our members are saying ‘We won’t relinquish stocks’,” Master Electricians chief executive Alexandra Vranyac-Wheeler told the Herald. The hardware could be held hostage until SolarZero - or the liquidators now in control of the BlackRock-owned firm - paid out. And for panels that have already been attached to customers’ roofs, some Master Electricians are threatening, “I’m going to go uninstall them if I haven’t been paid for the installation”, Vranyac-Wheeler says. Her advice to members: Cool your jets. The Master Electricians’ boss said she appreciated her members’ anger, but had also told them to act ethically. Master Electricians had sought legal advice, which came through last night. “In short, members must notify the liquidators of any [SolarZero] equipment they hold so the liquidator can arrange for it to be picked up. It cannot be held back as a means of ensuring payment from the liquidators.” Some $4.1m is owed to trade creditors, the first report says. Her members had to appreciate that SolarZero operated on a separate model. Usually, an installer would buy solar panels and batteries from a wholesaler. With SolarZero’s model, the firm retained ownership of the hardware through the life of the customer’s 25-year contract. Vranyac-Wheeler said 15 former installers for SolarZero who were Master Electricians have come forward - including Laser Electrical overnight. The amount owed to the industry group’s members was at least $118,000. She said SolarZero customers had been looked after, but contractors had been left hanging. “Two non-members have also come forward. One is owed $70,000 who will probably have to fold his business,” she said. Vranyac-Wheeler said she would approach the Government about co-operating on a “retentions fund” or “rainy day fund” to aid small businesses in such collapses. She said a small levy on cable sales would be one potential way to fund it. The first report by liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen revealed, as expected, that they were still in the process of getting a full picture of the amounts owing amid a complex structure involving multiple SolarZero entities and tens of millions in intra-company loans. So far they have found just over $40 million due secured and unsecured creditors. The Inland Revenue Department and staff are near the front of the queue as preferred creditors. Outstanding taxes don’t figure in their first report, but Moore and Keen wrote: “We anticipate there will be amounts owing to the IRD once the pre-liquidation returns are filed”. The liquidators say they are aware of 173 preferential claims totalling $1.8m, “representing holiday pay owing to employees for accrued entitlement”. Their report also notes unsecured employee claims of $3.1m, due to a per-employee cap of $31,820 on preferential claims. The Government’s NZ Green Investment Fund, which extended a $145m credit line to SolarZero - $115m of which had been drawn down by the time of the liquidation - is listed as the only secured creditor so far. NZGIF is the primary beneficiary of one of the two special purpose vehicles holding the securitised debt - on the face of things affording it a measure of protection as the liquidators continue to assess the group’s commercial set-up. The report lists 598 unsecured creditors, who have until January 15 to prove their debt claims. The report says at this stage it is unknown if there will be sufficient funds to meet secured claims in full, but it does not paint a promising picture. SolarZero’s primary assets - its solar panels and batteries (mostly bought from China’s JA Solar and Japanese firm Panasonic, listed as creditors) - are installed at 15,000 homes and the 25-year customer contracts associated with them were securitised as debt held by two special purpose vehicles, which were placed under Public Trust control shortly before the liquidation. “Accordingly, these assets are not available to meet the claims of creditors,” the first report says. The available assets - including some $3.6m in solar panel stock, which the liquidators are in the process of retrieving from installers - and $22,275 in cash in the SolarZero group’s bank accounts - are modest. At this point, the creditors’ best hope could be a sale of the business - which is potentially on the cards. “Since the appointment, we have received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. “We are keeping an interested-parties register, and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders and Verofi [the firm named as the standby customer contract servicer shortly before the liquidation].” The liquidators are also investigating whether SolarZero’s intellectual property is saleable - including its “proprietary solar communications apps” and its “virtual power plant” technology, developed in-house, that allowed multiple customers to sell surplus power back to the grid - as they did during the March 10 cold snap. Any buyer will have to engineer a turnaround. The report reveals for the first time the amount that US private equity giant BlackRock paid for SolarZero in mid-2022 - $110m - and that BlackRock vehicle GRPIII injected significant additional capital to the group since its 2022 acquisition, totalling $147.8m in addition to the purchase price. Separately, BlackRock has told the Herald it did not take any funds out of the business. It adds: “Operationally, the group was not able to generate profit, nor did it reach break-even”.

Title: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF Now Holds $48 Billion in BTC

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has quickly become a major player in the cryptocurrency space after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the launch of various spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds back in January, to the point it now holds over 500,000 BTC. According to data from the firm’s website its spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) now holds a total of 500,380.09 BTC with a market value above the $48 billion mark, making it one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency. The rapid accumulation, amounting to 2.38% of all Bitcoin ever to be created in just under a year, reflects a significant shift in BlackRock’s stance on the digital asset. CEO Larry Fink, once a vocal critic, now views Bitcoin as an “independent asset class” with transformative potential. It’s worth noting that BlackRock’s IBIT doesn’t hold BTC for the firm directly, but rather for investors leveraging its fund to gain exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of these investors include clients of Wall Street giants, including Goldman Sachs. As CryptoGlobe reported the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, has recently announced it acquired an additional 15,400 Bitcoin for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $95,976 per coin, which helped its total BTC balance surpass 402,100 coins. According to a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) by the company’s co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylo, MicroStrategy has achieved a BTC Yield of 38.7% so far this year, and 63.3% year-to-date and now holds 402,100 BTC that were acquired for $23.4 billion. The company has acquired its BTC at an average of $58,263 per coin and its entire BTC stash is now worth $37.4 billion. The move comes at a time in which Bitcoin whales have been taking advantage of the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price dip to keep on accumulating BTC after short-term holders moved nearly $4 billion in the cryptocurrency to exchanges. According to CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the “panic selling” to accumulate, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day after short-term holders’ sales. In a post, the analyst noted that the figure was “reflected in institutional addresses on the network” but suggested more BTC was accumulated, as the funds that weren’t withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and remain in users’ accounts aren’t counted. Per his words, the whale accumulation hasn’t been sufficient to demonstrate a “more widespread buy-the-dip” pattern,” which he said remains concentrated among institutional investors.

Title: Crypto price predictions: HBAR, iDEGEN, Bitcoin

BTC/USD has been trading steadily above $90,000 for two weeks now; missing the all-important mark of $100,000 by less than 5 dollars on 22nd November. Even with the range-bound trading, the bullish trend persists. In fact, according to CoinMarketCap, greed continues to define the crypto market space. This week, the index is at an extreme greed level of 80 compared to last month’s neutral of 55. Even with the bullish trend, investors appear to be somewhat cautious. Bitcoin price has dropped by over 2% since the start of the weekend. As highlighted on sosovalue, BTC ETFs had daily net inflows of $353 million as of 2nd December. Of this number, BlackRock contributed $338 million with Grayscale and VanEck recording outflows of $28 million and $10 million respectively. The caution has further been heightened by the US government’s move to transfer Bitcoin worth $1.92 billion to a new address. While the intention is unclear, there are speculations over a possible selloff. In the recent past, countries like Bhutan and Germany have made huge selloffs of their BTC holdings. In recent years, cat and dog-themed meme coins have redefined the crypto space. While they are still a crucial part of the market, there is a new widely-hyped entrant; AI meme coins. At the center of this buzz is iDEGEN, an advanced AI agent born on X and shaped by the cryptocurrency community. So intense is its hype that its auction has already raised over $1 million and yielded gains of over 100800% to the early adopters. Interestingly, it is still at the experiment stage. As opposed to the usual presale, iDEGEN has chosen a different path; a dynamic auction. To start with, the total IDGN tokens are 11,111,111,111 with the auction being divided into 5-minute intervals.This means that every time there are consecutive buys within a span of 5 minutes, its price rises by 5%. If no bid is placed within two 5-minute periods, the price drops by 5%. At the end of the auction, IDGN launching price will be 10% higher than the final price at the auction. At that point, all unsold tokens will be destroyed. In addition to this pricing-based excitement, its freeness has further contributed to iDEGEN going viral. Unlike centralized companies like OpenAI, iDEGEN has no guard rails. In fact, the only applicable rule for this AI agent is that it has to post on Crypto Twitter(CT) after every 60 minutes. Between one post and the next, it internalizes the information availed to it by the crypto degens. This is exactly what the savvy investors are banking on; securing some IDGN tokens before its value skyrockets. Different groups within the CT space will strive to control this AI agent. This push and pull is bound to intestify its virality with the investors being the ultimate beneficiaries. Besides, the program’s unconstrained nature means that it can evolve in different ways. This includes trading the existing assets or even creating its own. With this infinite potential, the market’s focus is set to remain on iDEGEN for a long time. You can buy the iDEGEN token here. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has been trading in the green for five consecutive weeks, hitting a level last recorded in January 2022 on 3rd December. Over the span of those five weeks, the crypto has been up by more than 700%. As at the time of writing, its market cap stood at $12.49 billion, up by 17%. Besides, its trading volumes were up by 61% over the past 24 hours at $7.55 billion. The hype around this token has more traders fearing to miss out on a profitable opportunity. As a result, an increasing number of investors are accumulating the HBAR tokens.

Title: Why Is Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Among the Big Data Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other big data stocks. Big data refers to large and diverse collections of data that cannot be managed by traditional data processing tools. Although the need to manage large data sets goes back to the 1960s and 1970s, it was around 2005 when open-source frameworks were created to store and analyze big data sets. Then, the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled gathering more data on product performance and customer usage patterns with more devices connected to the Internet. With the current expansion of generative AI and cloud computing enterprise use, big data continues to grow. According to a report by Research and Markets, the big data market is projected to grow from $220.2 billion in 2023 to $401.2 billion by 2028, at a compound annual growth rate of 12.7% during the forecast period. Region-wise, North America holds the largest market share, driven by early adoption of big data solutions, a mature IT infrastructure, and a strong focus on innovation. Simultaneously, Asia Pacific serves as the fastest-growing segment in the market as a result of rapid digitization, proactive government support for technological advancements, and growing internet connectivity. Big data offers numerous benefits such as enhancing predictive capabilities, better insights, strategic decision-making, personalized customer experiences, and improved operational efficiency. The use cases for big data are diverse spanning various industries including retail and ecommerce, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, as well as government and public services. For instance, the e-commerce giant Amazon utilizes big data gathered from customers to fine-tune its recommendation engine to recommend products to customers who tend to feel overwhelmed by the variety of choices available to them in the modern era. Such suggestions tend to drive impulsive purchases. Simultaneously, the biotech leader AstraZeneca has unlocked the potential of data and AI-driven drug discovery and development. The firm claimed to hold a vast trove of oncology data from numerous consenting patients, including clinical, imaging, and multi-omics data. This data is fed by the firm's Oncology Data Science team into a system that uses AI and other statistical tools to generate novel hypotheses in oncology drug development. Other than data from its clinical trials, the firm also collaborates with external companies to leverage real-world data that represents patients from across the globe. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we went through relevant ETFs and media reports to make a list of big data stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 12 best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders, as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is an American software company focused on big data analytics. The firm makes products for human-driven analysis of real-world data and focuses on creating the world’s best user experience for working with data. With organizations around the world using Palantir to help them do their most important work, the firm has gained a reputation and has even made it to the S&P 500 based on the strength of its business and the expanding demand for its software. The US market remains the core of the firm’s business and growth, with the US institutions rapidly adopting the firm’s platforms and artificial intelligence capabilities more broadly. Palantir is experiencing an unwavering demand for its advanced artificial intelligence technologies from the US government and commercial customers. The third quarter was definitely strong for Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) amidst the unrelenting AI demand from the US. The firm generated the largest profit in the company’s twenty-year history, reaching $144 million in net income. Palantir reported revenue growth of 30% year-over-year while U.S. revenue grew 44% year-over-year. The firm was also successful in boosting its customer count by 39% year-over-year. Thus, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading big data stock that is witnessing accelerating business growth under a U.S.-driven AI revolution. As of Q3, the stock is held by 43 hedge funds. Overall PLTR ranks 9th on our list of the best big data stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tara Reade: Biden’s foreign policy isn’t just a failure, it’s an existential crisis

You can find Tara’s work at tarareadepodcast.com By Tara Reade, an RT contributor, author, geopolitical analyst and former Senate Aide. You can find Tara’s work at tarareadepodcast.com The US government has long touted its role as a beacon of diplomacy and stability, but the Biden administration’s foreign policy lays bare the tragic reality: A pattern of hubris, aggression, and reckless decision-making. Instead of fostering peace, key players such as Antony Blinken, Victoria Nuland, James Rubin, and Jake Sullivan have driven the US to the brink of World War III by engaging in dangerous provocations with Russia. These figures are well known, although some remain in the shadows more than others. For instance, Rubin has worked with Biden since the 1990s and was mentored by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. You rarely see him in front of the cameras but his hawkish diplomacy style (or lack thereof) has its fingerprints all over the Biden regime’s foreign policy positions. The escalation didn’t begin with Joe Biden either. Former President Barack Obama and other elites were all over Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan coup, where the US helped orchestrate the ousting of a democratically elected government, one that had sought cooperation with Moscow. For the past eight years, this interventionist, aggressive approach has left a trail of destruction, destabilizing Eastern Europe and alienating nations that have long resisted the West’s hegemony. Yet, under Biden, this dangerous trajectory has accelerated. Let’s consider the Minsk agreements, which were supposed to be a roadmap to peace in eastern Ukraine. Instead of pressuring Kiev to honor its commitments, Washington abandoned diplomacy and doubled down on its anti-Russia stance, pushing NATO’s military infrastructure ever closer to Russia’s borders. These actions ignored years of warnings from experts who cautioned that such moves would leave Moscow with no choice but to respond. Not to mention the thousands of sanctions against Russia in an attempt to freeze its economy. But Russia has proven as impervious to frozen assets as it is to winter. The Russian economy is now ranked fourth in the world by purchasing power parity. The Biden administration has effectively surrounded itself with hawks who are less interested in negotiation and more intent on maintaining US dominance at any cost. Victoria Nuland, the former under secretary of state infamous for her leaked “F**k the EU” comment during the Maidan crisis, embodies the disdain for genuine diplomacy that has infected Washington. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with his unyielding approach to international relations, has proven incapable of understanding the value of compromise. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan’s focus on projecting short-term US power undermines long-term global stability. Sullivan’s anti-China sentiments are also well known. The nightmare team Biden and Obama had around them are a reason for failed diplomacy, the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, and endless wars amping up. It is well known that Washington has turned Ukraine into a proxy battlefield and Blackrock playground. According to General Michael Flynn in a recent X panel that I also took part in, Ukraine is a big money laundering scheme for the globalist elites. Biden has been feeding billions of taxpayer dollars into a war effort designed not to protect Ukrainian sovereignty but to weaken Russia as a front to enrich a few and destroy many. This unconscionable strategy has brought the world closer to nuclear confrontation than at any point since the Cold War. The administration’s insistence on escalation, rather than conversation, demonstrates a stunning disregard for human life – not just in Eastern Europe but worldwide. Yet the failures of US foreign policy don’t end there. By treating Russia as a pariah state and dismissing its legitimate security concerns, the Biden administration has pushed Moscow into strengthening alliances with other global powers, most notably China. The US’ actions have also alienated the Global South, where nations increasingly view Washington as a destabilizing force. The BRICS group – which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the UAE – has emerged as a counterweight to US hegemony, with its member nations openly rejecting the dollar’s dominance and the unipolar world order. The tragedy is that this was all avoidable. Washington had countless opportunities to engage in meaningful dialogue with Moscow. Instead, it chose the path of arrogance, dismissing diplomacy as weakness and treating great-power competition as a zero-sum game. In doing so, the Biden administration has not only endangered the American people but also placed the entire world on the precipice of a nuclear exchange. As someone who has seen the darker side of US politics, I know firsthand how Washington’s obsession with power can leave devastation in its wake. The Biden administration’s foreign policy isn’t just a failure – it’s an existential crisis. The question now is whether there is still time to change course. The stakes could not be higher. The world doesn’t need more war. The world needs leaders who are not interested in profiting from war, but in stability and peace. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been showing patience so far. As he has stated many times, Russia truly does not want to war with NATO and the US, but how many more of Russia’s red lines will be crossed? The clock is ticking until President-elect Donald Trump takes office – hopefully with a different foreign policy strategy. Until that happens, we are all living on borrowed time.

By Bob Unruh December 3, 2024 Multiple states have joined in a lawsuit against several major investors in the coal industry far taking their climate change ideology too far – and actually threatening the nation’s energy supply. Fox News reports Wyoming, Texas, West Virginia and eight other states have gone to court against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, charging the industrial investing giants bought into and then used their leverage with various coal companies to “artificially” limit the industry. “These companies should only be maximizing returns for investors, not working to advance their radical climate change agenda by leveraging their holdings and pressuring American energy companies,” charged West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

According to the report, he warned his state stood to be directly harmed by the actions alleged as coal-fired power plants account for nearly 90% of Mountaineers’ electricity generation in 2022. Other states that are plaintiffs in the case include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana and Nebraska. The West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health & Safety reported 55,000 West Virginians work in coal mines as of 2023. Ken Paxton, the attorney general for Texas, said, “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. “BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices. Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of state and federal law.” A report at Cowboy State Daily explained Wyoming’s concerns. The report said the lawsuit is over “three massive investors” who are accused of “colluding to downsize coal companies in the name of achieving net-zero carbon emissions, and driving up energy prices for Americans and monopolizing the market in the process.” The report explained the defendants “all acquired large percentages of major coal companies, then used their influence to bully the companies into cutting production.” A statement from Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon’s office said the defendants, each, “has individually acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States. Each thereby has acquired the power to influence the policies of these competing companies and significantly diminish competition in the coal markets.” The defendants in 2021 had confirmed they would be activists in the climate agenda, with goals of cutting coal out of the energy production industry as much as possible. Gordon said, “Under the guise of ESG policies, (the investors) have leveraged their holdings and voted their shares to artificially constrain the supply of coal and significantly diminish competition in the markets for coal, which resulted in increased energy prices for American consumers and extraordinary profits for the asset managers.” The case seeks a court declaration the companies “violated an anti-monopoly federal law; to award damages to the states; to stop the investors from using their stock, proxy voting or other means to restrain coal output; and make the investors pay civil fines and penalties for violating a Texas business law, among other penalties,” the report said. The investors own about 30% of Peabody Energy, 34% of Arch Resources and small portions of other coal companies, like Black Hills Corp., the report said. Congress, since 1914, has banned acquiring stock where the effect is to substantially lessen competition. The report explained, “From 2019 through 2022, Peabody Energy’s production fell by 34.7 million tons, or 25.5%, says the complaint. Its revenues rose by $358.5 million during the same period, and its profits soared by $1.593 billion, or 853.9%. Arch Resources’ production fell by 9.4 million tons over that timeframe, or 11.7%, while its revenues rose by $1.448 billion and its profits skyrocketed by $1.097 billion, or 469.2%, says the complaint.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: BlackRock More Than Doubles Private Credit Business With HPS Investment Partners Acquisition

BlackRock announced Tuesday that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire private credit manager HPS Investment Partners LLC for $12 billion. The transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2025. HPS manages $148 billion in combined assets across both private credit and public credit strategies. The acquisition would more than double BlackRock’s $90 billion in private debt assets. The firm manages more than $11 trillion in total. According to the most recent figures from HPS, the fund’s private credit assets under management total about $123 billion, with public credit AUM of about $22 billion. “The combined private credit franchise will work side-by-side with BlackRock’s $3 trillion public fixed income business to provide both public and private income solutions for clients across their whole portfolios,” according to a BlackRock statement. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The credit manager was said to have been in talks with multiple suitors, including CVC Capital Partners, and considered an initial public offering, according to Bloomberg. Emirati fund Lunate reportedly also considered taking a minority stake in the manager. The acquisition would mark one of the largest acquisitions of a private credit manager, as banks and other financial institutions do not want to be left behind in the private credit boom. In 2019, Brookfield Asset Management acquired a 62% stake in credit manager Oaktree, adding $120 billion in assets. Brookfield managed $350 billion at the time. In late 2023, TPG ($213 billion assets under management) completed the $2.7 billion acquisition of Angelo Gordon, which managed $74 billion in credit and real estate assets at the time. Several banks have formed partnerships with private credit managers, such as a $25 billion alliance between Citi and Apollo Global Management, focused on direct lending, announced in September. In October, JPMorganChase announced partnerships with Cliffwater, FS Investments and Shankman Capital Management. According to PitchBook, institutional private credit AUM exceeded $1.6 trillion, as of December 31, 2023, with $520.2 billion in dry powder, according to the firm’s mid-2024 private debt report. In total, across institutional, retail and insurance funds, AUM exceeded $2 trillion. According to a statement, BlackRock expects the private debt market to grow to $4.5 trillion by 2030, more than doubling today’s figures. In October, BlackRock finalized the acquisition of infrastructure asset manager Global Infrastructure Partners, which managed $170 billion in assets. In July, the firm announced plans to acquire data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion. “For over 35 years, BlackRock has grown and evolved alongside the capital markets. With GIP, and now HPS, we are expanding our private markets capabilities across our comprehensive global platform,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. “Our Aladdin technology, including eFront, and soon Preqin, will make access to private markets simpler and more transparent. These capabilities, together with our global reach, deep relationships, and powerful technology, differentiate our ability to serve clients.” Related Stories: BlackRock to Acquire Alternatives Data Provider Preqin Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter BlackRock’s Purchase of GIP Deepens Its Alts Exposure Tags: BlackRock, HPS Investment Partners, Larry Fink, Private Credit « WAMCO Appoints New CEO After Former CIO Charged With Fraud

Title: Why ConocoPhillips (COP) Has the Biggest Upside Potential Among Oil Stocks
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-conocophillips-cop-biggest-upside-143642930.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) stands against the other oil stocks with biggest upside potential. In an interview with CNBC on November 26, Daan Struyven, Co-Head of Global Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, discussed the current state of the oil market and the potential impact of a ceasefire in the Middle East on oil prices. Struyven noted that while the geopolitical risk premium in oil prices was fairly modest, he thinks that the market is focused on risks with a clear path to lower production. The market has not yet fully priced into this possibility, and the current price of oil is too low compared to inventory fundamentals. Struyven pointed out that global oil inventories have edged down this year, and the market has been in a deficit of around 0.5% of global markets. He thinks that many oil investors are pricing in a large surplus for 2025, which Struyven believes is not done yet and he sees significant upside risk to prices in the short term, potentially coming from lower production from Iran. READ ALSO: 12 Best ADR Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts and Top 8 Stocks To Buy In 8 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months. Struyven noted that while the Trump administration's goals are achievable, they are largely driven by technological advancements and LNG export plans that are already underway despite any policy change. He also agreed that the big oil companies are not eager to spend more money on production on current oil prices. Struyven also highlighted OPEC's influence on the market, emphasizing Saudi Arabia's preference for higher oil prices. He suggested that OPEC would likely defend a price floor of around $70 per barrel but would not hesitate to increase supply if prices climb above $80. This aligns with his expectation that oil prices will remain within a range of $70 to $85 per barrel. Finally, Struyven attributed the changes in the oil market to the success of US shale production, which has accounted for 100% of global oil production growth over the past decade. This has put downward pressure on long-term prices, making it less likely for oil prices to spike above $100 as they did in the past. The oil market is influenced by a range of factors, including geopolitical risks, production levels, and OPEC's strategies. The potential for a ceasefire in the Middle East, for example, could impact prices, but the geopolitical risk premium is still relatively modest. Despite this, oil prices remain lower than expected based on inventory fundamentals. While these dynamics shape the near-term outlook, long-term oil price increases above $100 are less likely due to the impact of US shale production, which has accounted for all global oil production growth over the past decade. For this article, we sifted through Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 35 Oil stocks. We then sourced the analysts’ average price targets and picked the 10 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of November 29. We also included their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 22.20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is a leading independent exploration and production company with extensive crude oil operations worldwide. The company specializes in unconventional oil production from U.S. shale formations and traditional reservoirs in global markets. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) supplies crude oil to refineries, industrial customers, and international markets. On November 22, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) finalized its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO), enhancing its potential for long-term growth. The company anticipates achieving synergies exceeding $1 billion on a run-rate basis within the next 12 months. On October 31, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) announced its Q3 financial results. During the quarter, the company generated $5.8 billion in cash from operating activities, including $4.7 billion in cash from operations. It also raised its regular dividend by 34% to $0.78 per share and expanded its share repurchase authorization to $20 billion. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has presented a 10-year strategic plan emphasizing disciplined investment, steady growth, improved returns, and substantial cash distributions to shareholders. This approach positions ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) uniquely among its peers. Overall, COP ranks 9th on our list of oil stocks with biggest upside potential according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of COP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street Analysts React to HP (HPQ) Earnings – Bulls Vs Bears

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

A laptop, showing off the companys sleek notebook computers and workstations. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42 HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) recently posted quarterly results and the stock fell amid downbeat Q1 guidance. Citi maintained its Neutral rating on HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) but reduced the price target to $36.50 from $37. Analysts, led by Asiya Merchant, noted HP’s stock fell due to weaker-than-expected guidance, driven by subdued PC recovery and inflated commodity costs impacting margins in the short term. While they expect the PC recovery to gain momentum in upcoming quarters with margin improvement, the Print segment exceeded expectations. However, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) anticipates a low single-digit decline in the overall market through fiscal 2025. Margins are expected to remain at the top of HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s target range, thanks to a shift towards more profitable units and cost actions. The analysts noted that EPS for the year will likely fall a penny below consensus expectations at $3.60 (midpoint), but still below Citi’s forecast. On the other hand, Evercore kept an Outperform rating and a $40 price target. Amit Daryanani and his team highlighted HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ)’s solid results despite weak PC market conditions. While there are concerns about below-seasonal EPS guidance for Q1, the analysts believe the second-half guidance is reasonable given industry dynamics. TD Cowen maintained its Hold rating but raised the price target to $39 from $32, citing soft end markets that hinder the company’s progress with cost restructuring. The analysts noted that HP’s Q4 EPS met Street estimates, but the outlook missed expectations due to continued softness in the PC market and higher variable compensation costs for fiscal Q1 2025. Importantly, the analysts said HP’s fiscal 2025 EPS outlook is in line, as PC growth in the second half of the year and strong Print profitability should drive mid-single-digit EPS growth. While premium PC mix and the repricing of PC parts support Free Cash Flow, weak consumer PC demand and challenges in Print may limit HP’s ability to achieve significant EPS growth. J.P. Morgan maintained its Overweight rating but lowered the price target to $40 from $41. Overall, HPQ ranks 10th on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of HPQ, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HPQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stellantis' CEO stepping down shows how the auto industry is struggling to shift into high gear right now

Good morning! We've officially entered the season of company holiday parties. An etiquette expert shared some helpful tips to follow. (Take it easy on the booze.) In today's big story, an automaker CEO's resignation shows how tough a year the industry is having. What's on deck: But first, I'm just trying to get out of first gear. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. As dealerships look to clear their lots to make room for next year's models, automakers are also doing some housecleaning. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares resigned this weekend as the Jeep and Chrysler owner battles sliding sales. His expedited departure — Tavares was scheduled to leave in 2026 — shows how choppy the automotive industry remains. Stellantis' struggles have been particularly bad. Tavares's cost-cutting approach initially helped, but more recently the company's US sales were down 17% this year compared to last year, writes Business Insider's Nora Naughton. The new boss will have plenty of issues to sort through, including a legal battle with the United Auto Workers union, writes BI's Tom Carter. So, what's got the auto industry stuck in gear? There are three big issues at play here: The EV problem: Arguably the biggest issue facing automakers is slowing demand for electric vehicles. While EV sales are still rising, they aren't pacing how they were a few years ago. That's forced automakers to recalibrate strategies that were anticipating the EV good times would keep rolling. Hybrid cars are also making a comeback, further complicating plans. The China problem: As if the EV market wasn't hard enough, there's the added challenge of Chinese competitors gaining market share. Their budget-friendly EVs are proving to be a huge hit in the world's largest auto market (China), much to the annoyance of Tesla. They also turned heads at Europe's largest auto show this year. Even Ford CEO Jim Farley acknowledged how much he enjoyed a Chinese EV. (It hasn't been a complete lovefest; he also called China's auto industry an "existential threat.") The tariff problem: President-elect Donald Trump's surprise announcement to enact a 25% tax on goods imported from Mexico is the newest hurdle for automakers. The US imported more than $65 billion worth of car parts from Mexico last year. Tesla also previously announced plans for a new $10 billion factory in Mexico. Trump's trade plans might not ultimately be implemented, but the uncertainty means car manufacturers could reconsider their supply chains.

If you’ve been investing for a while, you’ve probably thought about private equity more than once. Adding exposure to “PE” firms, which buy and sell privately held businesses, is a great way to diversify beyond the big names of the S&P 500. But of course, to get in on that action, we have to be either institutional investors or have a net worth high enough to be “accredited.” Most people stop there. But there is a way to access private equity through a kind of lesser-known “back door.” For example, you could buy an ETF like the Invesco Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PSP) right on the stock market. The fund holds publicly traded PE firms like Blackstone, KKR & Co. (KKR) and the Carlyle Group (CG). It’s also had a pretty decent run, with a 9.1% annualized return over the last decade. More recently, though, PSP’s returns have been a bit weaker, reflecting a PE market recovering from its overvaluation in 2021. PSP Total Returns Ycharts However, private equity is recovering in 2024, with a year-to-date return above 25% both for PSP and the index on which it’s based: the S&P Global Listed Private Equity Index. That makes now an interesting time to invest in the PE space. But we can do better than PSP and its 2.9% yield (an annualized calculation based on the fund’s latest quarterly distribution) with the double-digit yielders I’ll show you in a bit. Doing so means we can use the higher cash flow to pay our bills and become more financially independent, of course. But a large income stream has a different function when it comes to private equity. Since this market can be highly volatile, a high dividend ensures we’re getting more of our return in cash, and at regular intervals. We can then either use these funds to diversify away from private equity or buy more at a bargain when the market turns against these assets. This is better than what most people do: Sell a bigger portion of their low-yielding “regular” stocks to generate cash. Trouble is, it’s easy to give in to emotion and do this more during bear markets, when it’s the worst time to do so financially. With that in mind, there are two closed-end funds (CEFs) with big parts of their portfolios in private equity that are compelling here: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ), which yields 13% as I write this, and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), with a 12.1% yield. BIGZ has about a quarter of its assets in private equity, and BSTZ is closer to a third. Both funds mainly focus the rest of their holdings on tech companies, like NVIDIA (NVDA) and chipmaker Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), that are themselves exposed to private firms through their vendors and customers. This diversification has helped both funds recover strongly since the 2022 selloff, with the last year showing particularly strong returns for BSTZ (in purple below). That’s partly because it devotes more of its portfolio to private equity. BSTZ/BIGZ Total Returns Ycharts In total, BIGZ’s private equity investments have seen a 44.1% decrease in their value on average, since the fund’s inception in 2021 (you can see a breakdown of the performance of BIGZ’s PE holdings and those of BSTZ here, on pages 9 and 14, respectively). This also explains why BIGZ trades at a 10.2% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) today. Management is just not doing the best job on the PE side. BSTZ, meantime, has had a positive 30.9% return on its PE investments, but that’s going back to late 2019, since the fund is older. This is clearly much better, which explains why BSTZ’s discount to NAV is much smaller than that of BIGZ, at 7.3%. Plus, BSTZ’s 12.1% dividend gives you more control over your investment than you’d have if you just bought PSP, the private-equity ETF we mentioned earlier. Plus—and this is the real key here—BSTZ’s performance is getting better over time as the PE market recovers, which may be why the CEF (in orange below) has been outrunning PSP lately: BSTZ Outperforms Ycharts That makes BSTZ the best buy here—not just for the PE exposure and the 12.1% income stream, but also because we can still get in at a decent discount as private equity continues to recover.

BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients BlackRock is buying credit investment manager HPS Investment Partners in a stock deal valued at about $12 billion, giving it more ways to service its insurance clients. BlackRock said Tuesday that the transaction includes equity issued by a subsidiary, and that the equity can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis into BlackRock common stock. The company said the transaction creates an integrated private credit franchise with approximately $220 billion in client assets. HPS has approximately $148 billion in client assets and is an independent provider of private credit for insurance clients. BlackRock said that the acquisition of HPS will position it to be a full-service, fiduciary provider of public-private asset management and technology solutions for insurance clients. BlackRock and HPS will create a new private financing solutions division. “Today marks an important milestone in our drive to become the world’s leading provider of private financing solutions,” HPS CEO Scott Kapnick said in a statement. “Our partnership with BlackRock will further strengthen our position in this fast growing but increasingly competitive market.” HPS is one of several acquisitions BlackRock has made this year. In January the New York company announced that it was buying independent infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners in a cash-and-stock deal valued at more than $12 billion. That transaction was completed in October. BlackRock then announced in June that it was buying private markets data provider Preqin in an approximately $3.2 billion deal. The acquisition is targeted to close before the end of the year. The transaction with HPS is expected to close mid-2025. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

"We have always sought to position ourselves ahead of our clients' needs. Together with the scale, capabilities, and expertise of the HPS team, BlackRock will deliver clients solutions that seamlessly blend public and private," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, comes during a boom for the private credit space. Comparable publicly traded companies to HPS such as Blue Owl Capital and Ares are up 54.6% and 46%, respectively, for 2024. Those gains are well ahead of BlackRock's 25.7% year-to-date gain. The transaction also creates "an integrated private credit franchise" with about $220 billion in assets, per BlackRock. HPS manages about $148 billion in assets. BlackRock oversees $11.5 trillion as of the third quarter. Sources told CNBC that HPS first sought to go public, which caught BlackRock's attention as it looks to grow its alternative assets business. BlackRock earlier this year announced it would acquire Global Infrastructure Partners and private market data provider Preqin for $12.5 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The deal is also expected to raise BlackRock's private market AUM and management fees by 40% and roughly 35%, respectively.

Company unveils strategy to expand America's largest fiber broadband network1 to 50 million+ total locations2.Company provides long-term guidance for sustained growth in consolidated service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted EPS, underpinned by continued capital investment.Company expects improved financial performance to support $40 billion+ of anticipated shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases over the next three years, including an initial share repurchase authorization of $10 billion that management expects to complete by the end of 2026.Company to webcast Analyst & Investor Day presentation at 2 p.m. ET today on the AT&T Investor Relations website. DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

DALLAS, Dec. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ahead of its 2024 Analyst & Investor Day presentation, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: NYSE:T) unveiled a bold, multi-year strategic plan highlighted by continued profitable 5G and fiber subscriber growth. This growth is expected to fuel enhanced shareholder returns on network investments through a robust and balanced capital allocation program. "Over the last four years, we've achieved durable and profitable subscriber growth, generated attractive returns on network investment, and strengthened our balance sheet," said John Stankey, AT&T CEO. "We're putting customers first to become the best connectivity provider in America. Our plan expands the country's largest fiber network to more than 50 million total locations, modernizes our wireless network and rewards our shareholders. As we grow, we expect to return more than $40 billion to shareholders over the next three years through dividends and share repurchases. With this bold strategy, we are entering a new era of sustained growth at AT&T." Momentum to Continue with Investment-Led Strategy and Customer-Centric ApproachAT&T is making progress on its journey to become the best connectivity provider in America. Over the past four-plus years, the Company has streamlined its operations and centered its business around the customer as it enhanced and simplified their experiences with AT&T. The Company has also greatly expanded its 5G and fiber services to more people and places and is the largest capital investor in U.S. connectivity infrastructure since 2019. With the plans announced today, the Company will unlock new capabilities that further its momentum while investing in future growth “ ultimately enabling more robust shareholder returns. As a result of continued investment, the Company expects to be in a differentiated position within the connectivity industry by the end of the decade. In Mobility, the Company is building a more efficient, high-capacity, programmable and open network. By 2027, it expects to have largely completed the modernization of its 5G wireless network with open technology, with deep mid-band 5G spectrum covering 300 million+ people by the end of 2026. This network will support super-fast download speeds and serve as a platform for new product and GenAI innovation. In broadband, the Company is creating even more distance between itself and the competition on what is already the largest fiber broadband network in America. By the end of 2029, it expects to reach 50 million+ total locations with fiber. This includes expectations to pass about 45 million locations through its organic fiber deployment and serve 5 million+ fiber locations through Gigapower, its joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), as well as through agreements with commercial open-access providers. The Company's fiber expansion will greatly increase its opportunity to serve customers how they want to be served, by one provider in a converged manner. While building the network of the future, the Company is actively working to exit its legacy copper network operations across the large majority of its wireline footprint by the end of 2029. The Company believes sustaining industry-leading levels of network investment and pursuing these strategic objectives will ultimately allow it to offer the best value, greater personalization and security and more customer-centric products and services on the largest, highest-capacity, lowest-marginal cost network in America. Long-Term OutlookAT&T expects to achieve the following 2025 and long-term financial targets through 2027. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, and as a result of the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity method investment, the Company plans to report adjusted EPS and free cash flow excluding earnings and cash flows related to DIRECTV. The Company continues to expect the sale of its entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG to close in mid-2025. For comparability to these targets, the Company has provided a recast of historical results for these two financial measures in its Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024.Consolidated service revenue growth in the low-single-digit range annually from 2025-2027.Mobility service revenue growth in the 2% to 3% range annually.Consumer fiber broadband revenue growth in the mid-teens annually.Adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% or better annually from 2025-2027.Mobility EBITDA growth in the 3% to 4% range annually.Consumer Wireline EBITDA grows at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2027.Business Wireline EBITDA declines at a low-double-digit CAGR through 2027; Business Solutions EBITDA approaching stabilization by the end of 2027.Capital investment in the $22 billion range annually from 2025-2027.Free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, of $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in free cash flow of $18 billion+ in 2027.In addition, AT&T expects to receive $5.4 billion of after-tax cash payments in 2025 and $0.5 billion in 2029 related to the sale of the DIRECTV investment.Adjusted EPS, excluding DIRECTV, of $1.97 to $2.07 in 2025, accelerating to double-digit percentage growth in 2027.$3 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by the end of 2027, inclusive of the Company's target of achieving $2 billion+ in run-rate cost savings by mid-2026.Long-Term Capital Allocation Plan: $50 Billion+ of Financial Capacity Supports $40 Billion+ of Dividends and Share RepurchasesAT&T expects this plan to provide $50 billion+ of financial capacity over the next three years, largely through organic growth. Financial capacity represents anticipated free cash flow after distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's stake in DIRECTV to TPG, as well as net borrowing capacity after the Company achieves its net leverage target. The Company continues to expect to achieve its net leverage target of net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA in the 2.5x range in the first half of 2025, and maintain leverage within this range through 2027. The Company expects to return $40 billion+ of this financial capacity to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Under this capital return plan, the Company expects to maintain its current annualized common stock dividend of $1.11 per share. This plan would result in $20 billion+ in total dividend payments, with capacity for about $20 billion in share repurchases, from 2025-2027. Under this plan, the Company also expects approximately $10 billion in incremental financial flexibility for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Of the $20 billion share repurchase capacity, AT&T's Board has authorized an initial tranche of approximately $10 billion in common stock repurchases. Management expects share repurchases under this authorization to commence when the Company reaches its net leverage target range and expects to conclude by the end of 2026. Additionally, the Company expects approximately $10 billion of share repurchases in 2027, pending Board authorization. 2024 OutlookFor the full-year, AT&T expects:Wireless service revenue growth in the 3% range.Broadband revenue growth of 7%+.Adjusted EBITDA growth in the 3% range.Capital investment at the high-end of the $21 to $22 billion range.Free cash flow in the $17 to $18 billion range, tracking toward the midpoint of this range; excluding approximately $2.5 billion of after-tax cash payments from DIRECTV, free cash flow in the $15 billion range.Adjusted EPS of $2.20 to $2.25, reflecting an increase from the previously provided $2.15 to $2.25 range. This includes an expected adjusted equity in net income from DIRECTV of approximately $0.30 per share post-tax. When excluding this, the Company expects adjusted EPS in the $1.90 to $1.95 range.Tune Into AT&T's Analyst & Investor Day PresentationThe Company will provide more details around its strategy and plans to drive strong returns to shareholders today at 2 p.m. ET.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsInformation set forth in this news release contains financial estimates and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results might differ materially. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in AT&T's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AT&T disclaims any obligation to update and revise statements contained in this news release based on new information or otherwise. This news release may contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available below and on the Company's website at investors.att.com. Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations to GAAP MeasuresSchedules and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures cited in this document to the most directly comparable financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) can be found at investors.att.com. Additionally, historical reconciliations for adjusted diluted EPS and free cash flow, excluding DIRECTV, can be found in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. Adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures frequently used by investors and credit rating agencies. EBITDA is net income plus income tax, interest and depreciation and amortization expenses minus equity in net income of affiliates and other income (expense) “ net. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding from operating revenues and operating expenses certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA and net debt (defined below) estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected Adjusted EBITDA and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics and related ratios without unreasonable effort. As a supplemental presentation to our Communications segment operating results, AT&T Business Solutions results are provided in the Financial and Operational Schedules & Non-GAAP Reconciliations document on the company's Investor Relations website, investors.att.com. Business Solutions includes both wireless and fixed operations and is calculated by combining our Mobility and Business Wireline operating units and then adjusting to remove non-business operations. This combined view presents a complete profile of the entire business customer relationship and underscores the importance of mobile solutions to serving our business customers. At the segment, business unit or Business Solutions, EBITDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues, expenses and other metrics which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected segment, business unit or Business Solutions EBITDA and the most comparable GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses, other income (expenses) and income tax expense, certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs, actuarial gains and losses, significant abandonments and impairments, benefit-related gains and losses, employee separation and other material gains and losses. Non-operational items arising from asset acquisitions and dispositions include the amortization of intangible assets. While the expense associated with the amortization of certain wireless licenses and customer lists is excluded, the revenue of the acquired companies is reflected in the measure and those assets contribute to revenue generation. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans due to the often-significant impact on our results (we immediately recognize this gain or loss in the income statement, pursuant to our accounting policy for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses). Consequently, our adjusted results reflect an expected return on plan assets rather than the actual return on plan assets, as included in the GAAP measure of income. The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, the Company plans to remove from adjusted earnings the equity in net income from our DIRECTV investment. Reconciliations of Adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and year-to-date 2024 to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. The Company expects adjustments to 2024 to 2027 reported diluted EPS to a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss and other items. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. For 2024, projected adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV in the $1.90-$1.95 range is calculated as projected adjusted EPS in the $2.20-$2.25 range, less an adjustment of approximately $0.30 to exclude approximately $2.8 billion (pre-tax) of adjusted equity income from the DIRECTV investment. Our projected 2024 adjusted EPS and projected 2024-2027 adjusted EPS excluding DIRECTV depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Free Cash Flow, for periods prior to 2025, is defined as cash from operations and cash distributions from DIRECTV (classified as investing activities) minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. Beginning with our first-quarter 2025 reporting, we plan to revise our definition of free cash flow to remove cash flows related to DIRECTV. Free Cash Flow excluding DIRECTV is expected to be defined as cash from operations minus cash flows related to our DIRECTV equity method investment (cash distributions less cash taxes paid from DIRECTV), minus capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing (classified as financing activities). Reconciliations of free cash flow excluding DIRECTV for 2023 and through the third quarter of 2024 have been recast to reflect the pending disposition of our DIRECTV equity investment and are included in our Form 8-K dated December 3, 2024. For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

For 2024, projected free cash flow in the $17-$18 billion range is $12.8 billion free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, plus an estimate of approximately $4.2-$5.2 billion for 4Q24 (cash from operating activities in the $10.7-$12.2 billion range, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0, minus capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range and cash paid for vendor financing in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, free cash flow of $12.8 billion is cash from operating activities of $26.9 billion, plus cash distributions from DIRECTV classified as investing activities of $0.9 billion, minus capital expenditures of $13.4 billion and cash paid for vendor financing of $1.6 billion. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between projected 2025-2027 free cash flow excluding DIRECTV and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Capital Investment provides a comprehensive view of cash used to invest in our networks, product developments and support systems. In connection with capital improvements, we have favorable payment terms of 120 days or more with certain vendors, referred to as vendor financing, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Capital investment includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing. For 2024, projected capital investment at the high-end of the $21-$22 billion range is $15.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($13.4 billion of capital expenditures plus $1.6 billion of vendor financing payments) plus an estimate for 4Q24 of approximately $6.5-$7.0 billion (capital expenditures in the $6.3-$6.7 billion range plus vendor financing payments in the $0.2-$0.3 billion range). Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact capital expenditures, vendor financing payments and future levels of revenues, the Company is not able to provide reconciliations between projected 2025-2027 capital investment and the most comparable GAAP metric without unreasonable effort. Financial Capacity for 2025-2027 of $50 billion+ represents anticipated cumulative free cash flow excluding DIRECTV (based on $16 billion+ in 2025, with annual growth of approximately $1 billion, resulting in $18 billion+ in 2027), less distributions to noncontrolling interests, plus expected cash payments from the announced agreement to sell AT&T's entire 70% stake in DIRECTV to TPG ($5.4 billion of after-tax cash distributions and other payments not subject to tax in 2025), plus an increase in net borrowing capacity (resulting from projected growth in EBITDA while maintaining net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2.5x range) after the Company achieves its net leverage target. Financial Flexibility for 2025-2027 represents incremental financial capacity for items such as potential organic or inorganic strategic growth investments, debt repayment, redemptions of noncontrolling interests, or additional dividends or share repurchases. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash from operating activities, capital expenditures, vendor financing payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and borrowing capacity, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation between these projected non-GAAP metrics and the reported GAAP metrics without unreasonable effort. Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by dividing net debt by the sum of the most recent four quarters of adjusted EBITDA (defined above). Net Debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents and time deposits (deposits at financial institutions that are greater than 90 days, e.g., certificates of deposit and time deposits) from total debt. © 2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Title: BlackRock strikes $12 billion deal for private credit firm HPS Investment

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) -BlackRock will buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion in an all-stock deal, the companies said on Tuesday, as the world's largest asset manager seeks to expand in a red-hot market. Private credit, or lending to companies by institutions other than banks, has grown rapidly in recent years as stricter regulations made it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. The asset class is expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data. "Together we will deliver income solutions for our clients that blend both the best of the public markets and the best of the private markets in an organized, unified fashion," BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. He has previously outlined private credit to be a "primary growth driver" within alternatives for BlackRock in coming years. HPS was founded in 2007 as a division of Highbridge Capital Management, the hedge fund unit of JPMorgan's asset management arm. In 2016, top HPS executives acquired the firm from JPMorgan. Since then, the New York-based company has become a massive private credit player, with assets under management vaulting to about $148 billion as of September from $34 billion in 2016. HPS originally aimed to do an initial public offering, but was approached by a number of parties including BlackRock, a source familiar with the matter said. HPS did not immediately return a request for comment. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, has an existing $85 billion private credit platform as of Sept. 30. A new private financing solutions business unit will be formed, which will be led by the HPS leadership team. BlackRock will pay roughly 9.2 million shares upon deal close that are worth about $9.4 billion as of Monday's close. Nearly 2.9 million shares will be paid in about five years, subject to certain conditions. As part of the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, BlackRock will retire for cash or refinance about $400 million of existing HPS debt. "The HPS deal positions BlackRock to offer comprehensive alternative asset management portfolio services to the largest institutions in the world ... significantly advancing its private-market growth goals," said Ana Arsov, global head of private credit at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Ratings. BlackRock's stock was last up 1.7% on Tuesday. “This is a really good move for them to try and bolster their higher fee areas,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp, which holds BlackRock shares. PRIVATE MARKETS PUSH BlackRock has been on an acquisition spree this year, splurging roughly $28 billion as it positions itself as a comprehensive platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. In October, the New York-based firm finalized its $12.5 billion acquisition of infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and anticipates completing the $3.2 billion purchase of private markets data provider Preqin by year-end. "GIP gave them infrastructure, but they still didn't really have a meaningful presence in private credit ... I think they've plugged the gap," said Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. The source familiar with the situation said a private equity firm could be BlackRock's next major acquisition. BlackRock declined comment. Edward Jones' Sanders said private equity is an area where BlackRock remains smaller than some of the largest firms, although it is a more mature product with likely less growth potential than infrastructure and private credit. This year's deals aim to strengthen BlackRock's foothold in infrastructure investments and private markets, both pivotal growth areas. Fink on Tuesday said he expected a "dramatic expansion" of private capital in backing infrastructure investments. BlackRock manages roughly $450 billion in alternative assets post-GIP acquisition. HIGHER FEES The HPS deal, which will create a private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets, will also increase BlackRock's private markets fee-paying assets under management and management fees by 40% and about 35%, respectively. Recent acquisitions will bolster BlackRock fees when compared to "razor thin margins" coming from passive investment, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. Private assets carry much higher fees than exchange-traded funds, which is BlackRock's main business. Still, BlackRock's rival alternative asset managers Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) have made bigger strides in private credit. Apollo manages $598 billion in credit assets and Ares $335 billion as of Sept. 30. Blackstone manages $432 billion in assets across its entire credit platform. The HPS deal comes amid speculation BlackRock's long-time boss Fink may eventually step down from leading the firm. Speaking at a New York event in October, Fink said the growth of private markets could mitigate the economic impact of wide U.S. deficits and high government debt levels. He also said at the time he was not thinking about retiring. In an op-ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in November, Fink said private investments in infrastructure projects such as data centers could help boost U.S. economic growth.

Title: Behind BlackRock's ambitions to push into private markets

Time Published: 2024-12-03T10:00:01Z

Larry Fink is looking to close 2024 as he started it — by announcing a big acquisition that brings BlackRock closer to dominating private-market investing. BlackRock is set to buy HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit behemoth managing $148 billion, in an all-stock deal worth about $12 billion, the firms announced Tuesday. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive and cofounder, built the world's largest asset manager, with $11.5 trillion in assets, by packaging public markets into cheap funds for the masses. He's now been very vocal about the firm's push into the profitable private markets. This shift in strategy could lead to a more valuable BlackRock, which might just be enough for Fink, who turned 72 last month, to finally pass on the reins to his yet-to-be-named successor. In January, the firm announced that it would buy the private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, with about $170 billion in assets, for about $12.5 billion in cash and stock. The deal, its biggest one since it bought Barclays' asset-management business in 2009, closed in October. In June, it agreed to buy the data giant Preqin, which it hopes will help bring some of these more complex private strategies to a broader audience. In addition to the HPS talks, the Financial Times reported that BlackRock was eyeing a stake in Izzy Englander's $70 billion hedge fund, Millennium Management. BlackRock is not new to reshaping itself through acquisition. The Barclays deal gave the firm iShares and helped it become the passive-investing giant it now is. "I do not want us to be comfortable in our business model," Fink said during the firm's investor day in summer 2023. "I want to make sure we're questioning our business model and we are focusing on how to best serve our clients, and if we truly believe there is some great need that we need to do, we are going to reimagine who we are in our business model." Acquiring HPS could be another transformational deal for the company, helping it reach the same scale it has in public equities and bonds in private markets. HPS is set to push its alternative assets to more than $600 billion. BlackRock's private-credit business is poised to now have a combined $220 billion in client assets. The deal is expected to increase private-market fee-paying assets under management by 40% and management fees by 35%, BlackRock said. HPS was founded by CEO Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, along with Scot French and Michael Patterson, in 2007 as a unit within JPMorgan called Highbridge Capital Management. Principals from the firm bought it out in 2016 after the bank's appetite for high-risk loans waned. The three are now set to join BlackRock's global executive committee and lead a new unit combining HPS and BlackRock's existing private-credit business. The secretive firm has been at the forefront of the private-credit boom, a result of the 2008 financial crisis and banks' withdrawal from risky lending. Private players moved in to make loans to companies when Wall Street giants were reluctant to. "Our competitors refer to us as the nerds of private credit and we take no offense," French told Bloomberg in an interview in November 2023. The firm, which was previously working toward an initial public offering, caters mostly to institutional investors and has more than 760 employees in offices around the world, according to its website. BlackRock brought in more assets in the third quarter than ever before, mostly down to its index funds. But in its October earnings call, the firm's leaders were already focused on its growth engine — GIP. GIP is expected to add $250 million in management fees in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a revenue-growth story," Martin Small, BlackRock's chief financial officer, said during that call. Private-equity and credit investments are much more expensive than BlackRock's usual roster of funds and in high demand from institutions like pensions and endowments, as well as ultrawealthy investors. While BlackRock has long had an alternatives investing unit, until recently, its private-markets assets were meaningfully smaller than those of the main players in the space, such as Apollo and KKR. It's tried growing through acquisition in this space in the past. In 2018, BlackRock bought a small credit manager, Tennenbaum Capital Partners, which at that time had about $9 billion in committed client capital, but saw several investment professionals exit. BlackRock expects the private-debt market to more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. While private credit's high yields and returns have increasingly attracted wealth managers and institutions alike, the deal will likely strengthen relationships with insurance firms, which have a longer investing horizon. Ana Arsov, Moody's Ratings' global head of private credit, said the acquisition was "catapulting" BlackRock into the ranks of the top five private-credit managers and would significantly advance its private-market growth goals. "BlackRock's large installed base of insurance-client assets offers a prime opportunity to cross-sell HPS's capabilities," Arsov said. "Additionally, BlackRock's extensive distribution network of institutional investors and wealth managers opens new markets for HPS." Jump to

Title: Godrej Properties raises ₹6K cr via QIP mainly to acquire land for future development

New Delhi, Dec 3 (PTI) Realty firm Godrej Properties Ltd has raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC and SBI Pension, through qualified institutional placement (QIP) route as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. On November 27th, the company launched its QIP issue to raise up to ₹6,000 crore. The company has raised this amount by diluting nearly 8 per cent of equity through the QIP issue, which was closed on Monday. The QIP Placement Committee of the board approved the issue price of ₹2,595 per equity share, which is at a discount of ₹132.44 (4.86 per cent of the floor price) to the floor price of ₹2,727.44 per equity share. It also approved the allocation of 2,31,21,387 equity shares to be allotted to eligible qualified institutional buyers. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Godrej Properties informed that the QIP issue saw a strong demand of around 4 times the size of the QIP. The issue also had a healthy mix of leading international and domestic investors including GIC, Blackrock, Aberdeen, Norges Bank, SBI Pension, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. As a result of the QIP, Godrej Properties said its "net worth has increased by more than 50 per cent while the equity dilution was 7.68 per cent". The company's gearing ratio will come down to below 0.2:1 from 0.7:1 as of September 30, 2024. Commenting on the fundraise, Pirojsha Godrej, Executive Chairperson, Godrej Properties Ltd, said, "We greatly appreciate the confidence and support of the investment community and will do our best to ensure we utilize this capital wisely."

Title: Tokenized Securities Exchange 21X Wins Approval from Germany’s BaFin

21X, a Frankfurt-based company building a blockchain-based exchange to list and trade tokenized securities, has received approval to go live from Germany's financial supervisory authority, BaFin. The 21X exchange, which runs on the scalable Polygon chain, plans to launch its exchange for tokenized financial instruments from its Frankfurt headquarters in the first quarter of 2025, the company said on Tuesday. The plan is to trade tokenized equity, debt securities, funds, as well as more exotic real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate or artworks that qualify as eligible financial instruments. Tokenization has become popular among traditional finance firms, with the likes of asset manager BlackRock now driving the trend. From a regulatory perspective, Europe is on the verge of welcoming a new regime for crypto assets, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the next phase of which is set to start at the end of this year. The 21X license has been issued under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime (DLTR), and is the result of an 18-month process that involved BaFin, the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), 21X said in a press release. “This is more than just a license – it’s a revolutionary moment for capital markets,” said Max Heinzle, CEO of 21X in a statement. “For the first time ever institutional and retail investors can trade and settle tokenized securities on a fully regulated, blockchain-based exchange with the same level of trust, security and compliance as traditional markets.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Title: Drinks industry veteran Patrick J Rigney invests in new Dublin brewery

Drinks industry entrepreneur Patrick J Rigney has invested in Changing Times Brewery, the newly launched beer-maker in Glasnevin, Dublin, backed by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs. Mr Rigney has been instrumental in Ireland’s drinks industry for decades, establishing brands such as Baileys as global leaders. Before establishing his own business – the Shed Distillery of PJ Rigney – he created brands including the twin-bottle Sheridan’s Irish Cream Liqueur. He also owns a distillery in Co Leitrim where he produces Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, which is his primary brand. Changing Times Brewery, located adjacent to the Royal Canal in Glasnevin, said Mr Rigney will join the group as chairman, with his involvement bringing the total investment among its backers to “over €2 million”. When the launch of the brewery was announced last month, its backers said they had put €1.8 million into the project, which would suggest Mr Rigney’s investment is in the region of €200,000. Its backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of the Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of popular bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. It is also backed by the publican families behind the Ferryman, the Long Hall, the Swan, Darkey Kellys, the Bankers, Arthur Maynes in Donnybrook, Devitts, Doheny & Nesbitts, Lemon and Duke, the Bridge 1859, the Blackrock and the Bank. The group said Mr Rigney’s investment marked his first involvement in a brewery, and said his experience in the industry would be valuable for the company. “Changing Times hope to utilise his extensive contacts, creative entrepreneurship, vast experience in bringing new brands to market and his global perspective in helping to establish and grow their brand and products,” it said. Initially the brewery’s new beers are being stocked in the pubs of its founding members, with further pubs “expected to be announced soon”. “I was greatly flattered when I was asked to get involved in Changing Times Brewery, which I think represents a real innovation in the Irish beer market,” said Mr Rigney. “The families behind this brewery are steeped in the pub heritage of Dublin and Ireland with years and years’ of experience in catering to their customer’s tastes. They are a part of the fabric of the Dublin’s social culture. “Who could be better placed to deliver authentic, refreshingly Irish, locally brewed beers. I’m excited to come on board and to help them deliver a timely change for customers at the pub counter.” Colin Gleeson is an Irish Times reporter Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SolarZero collapse: Liquidators’ first report reveals more than $40 million owed
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/solarzero-collapse-liquidators-first-report-reveals-more-than-40-million-owed/OBA77JJHWJBA5FGH6L44752YQY/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T05:10:34Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The first liquidator’s report on SolarZero reveals the company owes more than $40 million to more than 700 creditors and staff. The Kiwi-founded solar and battery firm ceased operations last week and was placed in voluntary liquidation by its sole shareholder, an investment fund controlled by US private equity giant BlackRock. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton were appointed liquidators of the six entities – all in liquidation – that made up the Group. The reason for SolarZero’s collapse was due to it being unable to generate a profit – nor did it reach breakeven, the liquidators said. The company had 169 staff at the time of liquidation. The liquidators said they are aware of 173 preferential claims totalling $1,796,880, representing holiday pay owing to employees for accrued entitlement. Trade creditors with security are owed $3.1m. There are 598 unsecured creditors who are owed just over $34.9m. This includes $4.1m owing to trade creditors and $24.4m in intercompany payables. “At this stage, it is unknown if there will be any funds available to make payment to unsecured creditors,” the report said. The liquidator’s report also confirmed BlackRock had bought SolarZero for $110m from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price has not been previously disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. Since the acquisition, BlackRock has injected a further $147.8m into the business, the report said. Last week the company said its customers – of which is estimated to be 15,500 – would not be affected by the liquidation. The liquidator’s report said SolarZero’s cash generating assets, and associated obligations, including most of its contracts with its customers, were legally transferred into special purpose trusts controlled by Public Trust. “This means that the majority of the Group’s SolarZero customers are not creditors of any of the companies.” The Public Trust has been quoted as saying “The trusts continue to operate as a going concern and are focused on ensuring services continue for customers”. The liquidators said since their appointment they have received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. “We are keeping an interested parties register and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders,” they said. On Friday about a dozen former staff protested outside BlackRock’s Auckland office, claiming they were owed $1.4m in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We also have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000,” one of the protest organisers told the Herald. Such sums were “chump change” for BlackRock, he said. Master Electricians chief executive Alexandra Vranyac-Wheeler said 14 former installers for SolarZero were Master Electricians have come forward. The amount owed to the industry group’s members was at least $118,000. Electricians outside the group had also approached it. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Societe Generale. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations,” NZGIF said on Friday. Finance Minister Nicola Willis, who is due to meet with NZGIF executives later this week, said she was urgently seeking more information. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald last week: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract.

Title: Altcoin Boom Forecasted: Expert Predicts $1.4 Trillion Market Cap With Bitcoin At $130,000

As the cryptocurrency market experiences a notable uptrend, altcoins have begun to take center stage while Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates just below its recent record high of $99,540. This shift has led to significant capital rotation toward altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and XRP, both of which have outperformed many of the top ten cryptocurrencies over the past month. Market analyst Doctor Profit recently shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that while retail traders seem to be selling off their holdings, cryptocurrency whales are accumulating Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. According to his analysis, in the last three to five weeks, these whales have amassed $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Conversely, retail traders appear to be sidelined, primarily holding USDT as they panic-sell without clear justification. Doctor Profit also noted that Ethereum (ETH) is currently “undervalued” according to its market value to realized value (MVRV) chart and is showing signs of upward momentum. This month alone has seen 245,000 ETH in exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, with Ethereum ETFs surpassing Bitcoin ETF inflows for the first time, signaling a significant shift in institutional interest. The analyst suggests that the market is pricing in a potential altcoin-focused ETF launch in 2025, with S-1 filings made by asset managers such as Bitwise and Canaray Capital, among others, for these index funds to invest in Solana, Litecoin, XRP, and Hedera. According to Doctor Profit, the market is entering the “altcoin season” with previous periods of stagnation behind. He predicts that the upcoming XRP ETF, rumored to be launched by major financial institutions such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, will spur further interest in the altcoin market. Delving into the market’s dynamics, Doctor Profit emphasizes the importance of the Bitcoin to altcoin market cap ratio. In previous market cycles, a drop in this ratio has signaled impending corrections for Bitcoin. For instance, during the peak of April 2021, Bitcoin had a market cap of $1.2 trillion, while altcoins were valued at $984 billion, creating a healthier 50% ratio. However, when this ratio fell to 20% and later to 18%, Bitcoin faced substantial corrections. Currently, the altcoin market is undervalued relative to Bitcoin, with the ratio sitting at an extreme 95%. This discrepancy suggests that Bitcoin is overvaluing the altcoin market, which Doctor Profit views as a positive indicator for both sectors. The analyst further predicts a robust altcoin market cap of $1.4 trillion by Q1 2025, supported by anticipated altcoin ETFs, while Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,000. At the time of writing, XRP, the third largest digital asset on the market, is trading at $2.73, boasting a colossal market cap surge towards the $152 billion mark, setting a new all-time high in this metric for the token.
