Title: China Ramps Up Criticism Of BlackRock Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. A cargo ship sails through the Panama Canal next to the entrance of the Balboa Port, in Panama City, Panama, March 13, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Angus Whitley Mar 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) – Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: How Vently became San Francisco’s top event party planner
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/16/vently-event-startup-takes-over-san-francisco/
Time Published: 2025-03-16T16:18:22Z
Full Content:
When Nicolas Khonaysser, 26, moved back to the Bay Area after graduate school in 2024, he was thrown by how unfamiliar the city felt. He’s been in Walnut Creek since age 10, when his family relocated from France. As a teenager, he’d felt connected to the Bay’s thriving social scene. But after grad school, things felt different. “It was fragmented,” he said “You needed 10 different apps to know what was happening. And even then, you’d miss out on something cool.” He felt lonely. And he wasn’t alone. Data analysis from the Chronicle shows that 20-somethings are the largest demographic leaving San Francisco, with some citing a lack of connection as the reason. Jacob Wells, Khonaysser’s friend from Arizona State University, and some of his new connections felt similarly. Last May, they decided to take action, renting a six-bedroom house above a bar in the Excelsior. For Khonaysser and the others — five men and one woman — the house became a home, party venue, and the headquarters for their business, an events startup called Vently, which throws parties and lists events throughout the city. Khonaysser is the CEO. The goal? To help Gen Z, and everyone else, have fun again. And to make money by being Gen Z’s go-to events platform while they’re at it. The competition is stiff: Vently is up against legacy platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook Events, as well as newer players Posh, Lu.ma, and Partiful, which have collectively raised more than $50 million. Vently’s $500,000 in seed funding is comparatively pennies, but its party-forward, fun-centric brand has struck a chord with San Francisco’s dwindling 20-somethings, and the founders are hoping they can bring the city’s youthful energy back to life. Everything you need to know to start your day. When the friends moved into Vently HQ (which is also their home), they equipped it with three coffee machines, furnished the living room with cream loveseats and a 400-pound marble table, and decorated with porcelain vases tastefully printed with breasts, rehomed from a breast-milk startup that was moving out of the state. They installed a cold plunge tub on the deck, naturally, and a weights bench in the living room. To cap off the startup vibes, they hung a bedazzled purple Vently “V,” gifted from an investor, above the fireplace. They purchased an eight-seat Escalade so they could travel together. The month after they moved in, the team threw their first party. Khonaysser posted the invitation to Instagram: “Wine dinner. Eight strangers. … Dinner, drinks on us. Dm us.” Hundreds responded — nannies, tech workers, venture capitalists, local politicos — which confirmed his hunch. “People are hungry for connection,” he said. “They just need some help.” The night of the party, he donned a butler’s jacket, set the table, and waited by the door. All 12 RSVPs showed up, and from then on, “Dinner With Strangers” became a monthly event. Nowadays, it boasts a 5,000-strong waitlist. In the past year, Vently has promoted and hosted hundreds of events: Orangetheory workouts, bank raves, boat parties, a SantaCon takeover, viral “lookalike” contests. It has partnered with TechCrunch and the Golden State Warriors (“They reached out to us!,” Khonaysser said). The company has amassed 12,700 followers on Instagram and in November launched a platform where event organizers and venues can list and sell tickets, send text blasts, and manage their communities. Of course, living with cofounders — and hosting parties in the home — can put a strain on relationships. But Gargi Kand, 26, Vently’s head of growth and self-proclaimed “big sister” of the house, thrives on intensity. (Last year, she ran a marathon with no training. “Don’t recommend it,” she said. “Dislocated my knee a month later.”) Living in a party house with her colleagues has been generally low-stress, she said, noting that the guys are respectful and clean up after themselves. The only disagreements are over Khonaysser’s “pathological need” to blast the heat; the others forgive him because he makes a killer espresso martini. As for romantic entanglements, only Khonaysser is in a relationship. “If someone has girl problems, I’m the one they talk to,” Kand said. Jacob Wells, 22, who went to college with Khonaysser and is Vently’s COO, said he’s on standby if Kand needs relationship tips. “Gargi comes to me when she wants a straight-shooter opinion on her many dating problems,” he said. Vently’s evolution has led the founders to expand far beyond hosting parties: They aim to be the online platform of choice for any event in the Bay. Think Eventbrite, but with fewer fees, and for Gen Z. Andrew Wasilewski, CEO of The Faight Collective, an artist event space in the Haight, is a happy early Vently adopter. “Eventbrite’s fees are brutal,” he said. “We don’t just want random ticket buyers. We want to build a real, engaged community.” If Vently can streamline his team’s marketing and admin work from eight apps to one? “Game-changer.” The demand for a hub that centralizes local community events is real, said Nicolas Meader, a VC at Lioncrest Ventures, which backed Vently’s seed round. “The hardest time to make friends is if you move after college,” he said. “You go from having 20 friends down the street to no one, plus a ton of work responsibilities. Vently [helps] you get involved in the community.” Vently closed out January with its biggest partner event yet: the Quarter Century Tech Giga Party, a 2,500-person, five-floor conference-turned-club-night at Temple nightclub that ran from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. The team was hyped about the lineup, which included California State Treasurer Fiona Ma; VCs from Andreesen Horowitz, Sequoia, and Blackrock; and DJ sets from Twitch cofounder Justin Kan, and Arielle Zuckerberg (Mark’s sister). The night was beautifully chaotic: the layout was confusing, the acoustics made it hard to hear speakers, and attendees hadn’t been able to figure out if they should dress for a club or a conference. But there were many charming moments: the silent disco on the rainy rooftop, the hands that shot up when someone asked who’d used DeepSeek, the man in a cardboard robot costume doing the robot on the dance floor. It was a big night, but not Vently’s best party, according to some attendees, who referenced the 2025 New Year’s Eve masquerade ball, Hibernia bank rave in November, and the Halloween haunted mansion bash at a Palo Alto luxury estate. Khonaysser isn’t fazed by the growing number of well-funded event startups with which his company competes. “San Francisco is the best place to start something, the best place to party, the best place to make your mark,” he said. To drive that point home, Vently in January acquired issfback.com from an Andreessen Horowitz scout. In an odd twist, that website once redirected visitors to an October 2024 story in The Standard with the headline “SF is so back.” (We had nothing to do with it.)

Title: Why Is the Trump Administration So Obsessed with Shipping Lanes?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/03/why-is-the-trump-administration-so-focused-on-shipping-lanes.html
Time Published: 2025-03-16T10:00:00Z

The Trump administration’s focus with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure has been most visible in the Western media on the Panama Canal and Greenland but is occurring elsewhere as well. Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. As is often the case with Trump, he is only saying more loudly what has been US policy for some time. The US has for years worked to sabotage China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The US Marines shifted their focus to sea control capabilities as part of an effort to maintain naval dominance over China. [1] CSIS, 2018 So this is not unique to the Trump administration or simply the result of Trump’s reported interest in ships. It is US policy to encircle China, control global shipping, and have the capability to shut down maritime trade routes. Washington is now attempting to take or increase control of key global maritime chokepoints. Recently introduced legislation from a bipartisan group of senators is illustrative. Its stated aim is to monitor and counter China’s expanding control over strategic ports worldwide. There’s much attention paid to that “expanding control” by American think tanks and politicians, who throw around maps likes this: What do the numbers say? Here’s the Jamestown Foundation: While the United States dominates global maritime security, there is a huge disparity in the other direction when it comes to influence over maritime trade. Unlike the PRC, which controls around 12.6 percent of global port throughput through COSCO and CMP, the United States has no state-backed firms among the world’s leading terminal operators. In terms of global port influence, the United States would likely rank behind not only the PRC but also the United Arab Emirates (DP World), France (CMA CGM/Terminal Link), and Singapore (PSA International). Nevertheless, the US is calling it a “​​direct threat to American national security and economic interests.” More from gCaptain: The Strategic Ports Reporting Act, introduced by Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Ted Budd (R-NC), and Rick Scott (R-FL), would require the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive global mapping of ports considered vital to U.S. military, diplomatic, economic, and resource exploration interests. The legislation specifically targets efforts by the People’s Republic of China to build, buy, or control strategic maritime infrastructure around the world. That’s largely what the US is already doing. Let’s look at a few spots the US has circled as key to its goals. Panama Canal On March 4, BlackRock helped fulfill the Trump goal of “taking back” the Panama Canal when it purchased crucial berths on both sides of the waterway that sees about 6 percent of global trade passing through it. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” Nick Corbishley has more, including on US efforts to revive the Monroe Doctrine in order to squeeze China out of Latin America. But Panama ports accounted for only four percent of the deal value between BlackRock and Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. While it was a BlackRock-led consortium making the deal, it was largely the result of a US pressure campaign on the seller. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. It was more than just a blessing: Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. The story got more interesting on Thursday when Beijing, late to the party, made clear its displeasure with Hutchinson’s decision to sell to BlackRock. The website of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Chinese ministry in charge of the two special administrative regions, reposted a harsh criticism from the newspaper Tai Kung Pao towards the deal. What does that mean? Here’s more from Zichen Wang at Pekingnology: It is now crystal clear that Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison never coordinated with Beijing against Donald Trump’s economic coercion… The Ta Kung Pao condemnation, translated below, reveals Beijing’s concern that BlackRock, a U.S. company, will cooperate with Washington to impose additional costs on Chinese shipping or even threaten Chinese maritime trade… The condemnation didn’t ask CK Hutchison to unwind the deal but did describe the deal reached so far as “in principle.” The Hong Kong conglomerate has now been asked to reflect which side it is on – Beijing’s or Washington’s. Shortly after news broke that the US is drawing up plans to get its military on site at the Panama Canal — perhaps a way to keep the pressure on Hutchinson in case it’s thinking about trying to back out of the deal? Here’s NBC News: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. It doesn’t get much clearer than that. Greenland “Greenland is growing in importance as we find ourselves in a global competition with China and in a new technological revolution with regards to warfare,” Rebecca Pincus, director of the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute and a former adviser to the U.S. Defense Department on Arctic strategy, told RFE/RL. “So, Greenland is important from a missile-defense perspective, from a space perspective, and from a global competition perspective, in which shipping and maritime sea lanes are increasingly important,” she said. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus just on the shipping. The US used Project Ukraine to isolate Russia from the other seven Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US). Finland and Sweden are now, like the others, in NATO, and their Arctic regions are being further militarized. As a result, all Arctic states except Russia are NATO members. Greenland, as a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, is by default part of NATO, but there has been talk about independence, and it has in the past flirted with a closer relationship to Beijing — although China has largely abandoned most of its interest in in recent years. Some background there from the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs: China has shown interest in Greenland’s mineral wealth and proximity to potential shipping routes, but in recent years its presence on the island has dwindled. In 2018, China released a white paper detailing its Arctic strategy, including its intention to build a “Polar Silk Road,” in parallel with its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure investments in other regions. During the 2010s, Greenland courted Chinese mining companies to invest, but subsequent mining projects involving Chinese partners have stalled or failed. Pressure from the United States also helped quash Chinese bids to construct new airports and convert an abandoned Danish naval base into a research station. Though Greenland has expressed openness to working with international partners, China has not renewed its overtures. Greenland occupies a key position along two potential shipping routes through the Arctic: the Northwest Passage, along the northern coastline of North America, and the Transpolar Sea Route, through the center of the Arctic Ocean. As Arctic sea ice melts, these routes could reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals. These routes are economically unfeasible at the moment, but that’s expected to change, which means more stuff to fight over. From Antiwar: The extent of Arctic Sea Ice is now “more than two million square kilometers less than it was in the late twentieth century,” and “reductions in the amount of Arctic sea ice that survives summer melt have resulted in more newly formed ice (first-year ice) and less of the relatively thick, old ice that makes up the perennial ice cover.” Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof. South Africa We wrote last month about the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against South Africa and how it’s likely that shipping and naval base considerations are playing a large role. Just to recap: in South Africa this focus means a lot more attention for a small outpost in the Western Cape called Simon’s Town, which is home to the South African Navy’s largest base. Why would Simon’s Town help explain US pressure on South Africa? Here are Dr Frans Cronje, head of the Washington DC-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, and Rear Admiral Robert Higgs (Ret), who commanded the Fleet of South Africa from 2008-2010 and served as Chief of Naval Staff from 2011 to 2016 (he was also the first SA Navy officer to attend the US Naval War College), writing at Real Clear World: Simonstown’s contemporary importance is best understood as one of three points of a triangle that determines the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. That triangle is formed by drawing a 5,000 mile line northwards from Simonstown to Djibouti on the African east coast where the Bab al-Mandab Strait narrows the gateway into the Red Sea (and the Suez Canal beyond) to just 20 miles. The balance of power around that gateway shifted in 2016 when China was granted a lease on a naval base just more than a decade after the United States had secured a similar lease. From Djibouti extend the line 8,000 miles eastward to the Solomon Islands off the east coast of Australia. The Japanese, after crippling the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, sought to occupy the islands to isolate Australia and their retaking was a key allied objective in the liberation of South-East Asia. However, in April of 2022, eight decades after the defeat of Japan, China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands. As the islands lie east of the confines of the two major “island chains” around which John Foster Dulles’ Pacific containment strategy was conceived at the end of the Second World War the Chinese pact is the starkest challenge yet to the idea of the Pacific as “America’s lake”. Extend the line from the Solomon Islands back to Simonstown to complete the triangle and territory within sees the passage of more than half of all sea-borne global trade with the triangle’s three points determining access to the Red Sea, the South Atlantic, and the Pacific. Fight for the Red Sea On Feb. 1, President Donald Trump ordered the first airstrike of his presidency, against alleged senior Islamic State commanders in northern Somalia. That has continued: The US launched two airstrikes against Al Shabab in Somalia within a few days of each other. Not good. pic.twitter.com/4Ex3QMxqru — Dave DeCamp (@DecampDave) March 2, 2025 Why is the collapsed Horn of Africa country the recipient of so much violence from the “America First” administration? There are a few explanations. One could be found in friend of Trump Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, which right on cue after the Feb. 1 airstrike was out with a story, “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” That would mean that the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. The other explanation is that the US is in the process of increasing its presence in Somalia with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsbile Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use force against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, we’re getting a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Fun stuff. Across the Gulf of Aden, escalation with Yemen is now taking place. The Houthi movement (Ansarallah) announced on Wednesday that they will resume attacks on Israeli ships over Israel’s refusal to allow into Gaza what the Western media calls “aid”: It’s not aid. It’s water. It’s electricity. It’s food. It’s medicine. It’s the stuff of life. — Eman Abdelhadi (@emanabdelhadi) March 3, 2025 And so the Trump administration is upping sanctions pressure and issuing threats to Yemen (and Iran with belief that will restrict Houthi weapons) and has redesignated Ansarallah as a “foreign terrorist organization” but is also saying that should sanctions fail to achieve their objectives, they will take military action. And so they are. Still Going After Georgia Elsewhere, the US hasn’t forgotten about Georgia. NEW! A bipartisan legislation calling for sanctions against those undermining Georgian democracy, known as the MEGOBARI ACT, has now made its way to the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up in a matter of days 1/3 — Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) March 7, 2025 What’s MEGOBARI really about? Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien was blunt in a July Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation hearing: allow the US to control the country with money pouring into media and NGOs and no China port. Here’s what he said: Two things. One is it should be clear to the governing party in Georgia that there is a path back, that having free and fair elections without violence against civil society, making whatever transparency requirements they want. This Foreign Agent Law, make it compatible with EU law rather than compatible with Russian law, and not have China develop a deep water port in Anaklia. These are steps that are really important for Georgia to take. The deep water port at Anakalia refers to China’s deal to build one there on Georgia’s Black Sea coast. So, once again US policy remains the same despite the turnover in government in Washington. China Counter Strategy Would the US really be so crazy to retry its Russia “isolation” strategy against China? That would inevitably mean a collapse of the global economy and a contest of who could withstand the pain longer. China, which is striving for autarky and would, barring future developments, have direct land connections to Russia and Central Asia for minerals, natural resources, and other needs, might not get as hurt as some like to believe. The US, meanwhile, would face product shortages — including in a defense industry reliant on China — and inflation that would make recent years seem quaint by comparison. More likely is that the bright minds in the bowels of the Blob envision a return to the China of 20 years ago when it helped enrich American oligarchs with its low-wage manufacturing but knew its place. China has other plans and has been preparing for years to withstand US containment efforts. The West’s failed attempt to collapse Russia turned out to be a major gift to China as Moscow and Beijing doubled down on their economic ties. Here’s a glimpse of the latest Beijing strategy courtesy of Kyle Chan at High Capacity: Chinese companies are racing to build factories around the world and forge new global supply chains, driven by a desire to circumvent tariffs and secure access to markets. Chinese companies have been building manufacturing plants directly in large target markets, such as the EU and Brazil. And they’ve been building plants in “connector countries” like Mexico and Vietnam that provide access to developed markets through trade agreements. Morocco, for example, has emerged as a surprisingly popular destination for Chinese investment tied to EV and battery manufacturing due to its trade agreements with both the US and the EU. While tariffs and trade relations may change over time, an expanding global production network creates more robust channels of market access for Chinese companies, particularly as local jobs become attached to Chinese factories. One might see this as the third phase of China’s development of global supply chains more generally. The first phase was about securing access to resources. The second phase—the Belt and Road Initiative—was about building the infrastructure for global production and shipping. And now the third phase is about securing access to markets. How can the US reasonably be expected to hold back this wave? It’s impossible — at least by peaceful means. That’s why China and Russia continue to insist on “strategic interdependence.” The only other option for the US, in attempting to be the lone actor that can determine global outcomes, burns the world down rather than accept others having a seat at the table. Notes [1] Background from The Forge: Aspects of the global order are being challenged by rising powers such as China, whose economic development and military evolution mean that even a superpower such as the United States can no longer assume Sea Control in contested areas. This reality manifests itself in General Berger’s guidance, where he is directs the Marine Corps to restructure in order to support Sea Control operations designed to maintain the Navy’s freedom of action. He sees a return of the Fleet Marine Force concept that was used to good effect during the Pacific Campaign of World War 2 where Marines were integrated into Navy Sea Control operations – in effect working directly for the Navy – rather than being the main effort with the Navy supporting them. Berger foreshadowed the release of a new concept – the Stand-in Forces – to support the US National Defense Strategy and the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) concept. The Stand-In Forces are designed to generate “technically disruptive, tactical stand-in engagements that confront aggressor naval forces with an array of low signature, affordable and risk-worthy platforms and payloads”. Thanks for the summer upper. Since Trump wants to time machine back to the McKinley era it would hardly be surprising that his admin is trying to revive Mahan and the sea power controls the world theory. But now that ships are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from above and below is that even possible? And when it comes to the Arctic the time frame suggests that Trump and his minions will be obsolete long before any of this becomes relevant. “Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof.” So is it all signal or is it just noise so the flighty Trump can pretend he actually has a foreign policy suited to the 21st century instead of he 19th? Here’s agreeing with Larry Johnson in Links that Trump needs to concentrate on that Peace Prize and detente–an achievable goal–rather than trying to be the new Teddy Roosevelt. new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. Presumably this is a factor in Trump’s drive to annex Canada and Greenland. The Northwest Passage becomes entirely within US territorial waters. Looking at that map showing Greenland, I’m going to guess that Trump sooner or later will be saying how the US needs Iceland too because of its strategic significance. The 390,000 people living there cannot be allowed to get in the way of Trump’s idea of security. Sorry, not sorry. Regardless. I can see a flaw with this plan for domination of the world’s shipping lanes by the US and that is the US Navy. They are not up to it. They are overstretched and undermanned with their ships falling behind in maintenance. Their actual numbers are going down and not much thought seems to be going into the vital support ships that the US Navy needs. The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ and work out how they can try to do it. And now here you are talking about patrol squadrons for Panama, the Galapagos islands, Greenland, Somalia and god knows where else. Where will the ships come from. What about the people to man them. How is the logistics of it all going to work? You try to control everything and in the end you control nothing. And Navies are not cheap. Some may scoff at the PMC complaining about eviction from obscure or not so obscure study projects, but how much more wasteful and less employment friendly is the Pentagon, with its many golf courses and fixation on aircraft carriers and reliving the Battle of Midway? Musk has at least been somewhat consistent in calling the F35 “junk” but we are still waiting for that promised drawdown of military spending. If Trump takes a far too familiar blob direction and declares us at “war” with his critics therefore traitors then the Pentagon will of course never be touched, if anyone was expecting that. It is a bewildering time–and has been for years. I was wondering the same, what good is all this naval manoeuvring if you don’t have the ships, and the US definitely doesn’t have the ships, not even a merchant marine, really. And no capacity to build them, either. Nor the materials to build them, now that Trump is waging tariff warfare. Also, it seems to me that Greenland was of much more strategic significance in the cold war when the “GIUK Gap” was a thing and submarine launched nuclear missiles were considered the biggest threat. Greenland, Iceland and the UK have all cooperated with NATO against this threat, so what does acquiring Greenland add to the equation which already established NATO cooperation does not? And does this mean Trump is going after Iceland and the UK next? And anyway, isn’t the sub threat now obsoleted with Oreshnik? Is the idea that the US just plans to blow all container and tanker shipping out of the water, is putting ASuW missile bases within range of all commercial shipping as part of what is expected to be a final big showdown? Oreshnik is not a strategic silver bullet, in spite of all the hype. It in particular is a medium range IRBM with manoeuvring kinetic RVs replacing the nuclear warheads. That’s it. In principle, there’s a very short step to doing the same with long range ICBMs, except then you’re stepping closer to the risk of inviting a massive counterstrike when you launch it because there is no way to tell on launch if there is a nuke in the nose or not, so any and all ICBM launches will be assumed to be nukes (and trigger the counterstrike – use it or lose it). The reason Oresnik is a game changer is mainly European – it tells the decision makers in Paris, Berlin and London “we can hit you and not destroy your city” (and/or their military bases), so it dramatically increases the range of Russian NON-nuclear capabilities with absolutely nothing to counter it on the other side. Re when I said ‘The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ ‘ Just read earlier today that the US Navy now has to send the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, to the Caribbean to patrol it. Maybe to stop the Gulf of America from being renamed back to the Gulf of Mexico again? https://archive.md/YsASc#selection-515.43-515.53 I thought they say “aye aye”. 🫡 All those strategic plans regarding shipping lanes are understandable, but how will they be implemented? 1) China reportedly has a shipbuilding capacity that is 232 times the one of the USA — which is itself negligible in absolute numbers on a worldwide scale. 2) The USA has an enormous backlog of repair and maintenance for the ships and submarines of its navy. 3) The navy is so short of technical resources and personnel that it must decommission ships before they even reached the end of their useful life. 4) Almost every shipbuilding project in the past couple of decades — littoral combat ship, Zumwalt-class destroyer, Ford-class aircraft carrier — and now Constellation-class frigate, all expensive boondoggles. 5) What regards the Arctic, the USA has yet to renew its hopelessly aged fleet of (one barely functioning) icebreakers — and since it is the first time in 50 years a firm from the USA designs and builds one, skills have been lost and everything takes much more time than expected. 6) The fleet of auxiliary ships has been whittling away, and, because of a lack of personnel, the navy is idling those essential logistical vessels. Far away naval bases need to be manned and resupplied, and must keep a reliable lifeline with the home country, and be able to rely upon a relief fleet could break a siege. It will be interesting to see how this will be achieved in view of all the aforementioned issues. Imperial overstretch on steroids aided by an unshakeable belief in one’s own propaganda. Looking at the economic and technological trends, say over several decades, any expansive US plan to maintain hegemony that requires growth relative to China are comforting pipe dreams. In part it is an admission that the capablility to provide a convoy system in time of war no longer exists. No cheap and cheerful escort carriers, no where near the numbers of anti-submarine corvettes needed. The ships most needed to be convoyed, the VLCC’s and gas carriers impossible to protect due to size and slowness. The Russian riposte is the Poseiden torpedo system targeted to block up the limited number of carrier repair harbours and to close the main canals and perhaps to force the closure of the Malacca Straight. Should be able to block up places like Simons Town as well if the yanks force their way in there. They have to keep hostilities below the official war level because they have no counter to enemy strategic weapons but have to damage their economies enough to make them toe the line. The possibilities of a mistake are incredibly high. This is just my opinion The Pres has struck his deal. It is clear that the President has fully positioned himeself to place blame upon others if things go bad (lifelong business and personal practice). He has made the deal that whatever the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has in its objectives is the plan going forward, he does not want to be bothered with the details, just give him the talking points so he can go back to acting the part he played on TV. In return, he is to made to look the good guy, the boss, the one with the bright ideas but never the clueless ones and, above all, never is he to hear rummors that he wears no clothes. So why is Trump so obsessed with shipping lanes? It’s all laid out in the 2025 Presidential Transition Project – great detail sprinkled throughout with national security being the rational control the shipping lanes… his Tariffs, his objectives, his talking points, his culling of the ‘woke’ his putting cost onto the NATO on europes dime ….on and on it goes. What amazes me is such agastatude and shock both parties pretend – when it’s all in the document – after-all many of the projects… as noted above have been a bi-partisan work — I suppose, to promote a common cause by hiding their support for Genocide and other bi-partisan attrocities and economic idiocy they seam to use their mutual complicity – a cross blackmail of sorts – the same sort of child arguments – No you did it…no you did it..no you did it loop to obfuscate through verbal complexity a glaring truth (to me alone maybe – my truth) A shining light at the top of the hill, or a true democracy, a true republic, is most endanged when stained with the blood of genocide, human rights abuses, unchecked power and a distrust/disdain for the people who have elected by those elected. – Their remains a chasim/ a void of legitimacey thrust upon this country by those driven by lust for power. The Trump has put his transparent 2025 Presidential Transition Project clothes on to play the part he wants. However, he is naked without all his boot lickers (probably the wrong anotomical part). A fraudulent king. Some parts of the 25 project to lend some credibility to my pontifications above. Make irregular warfare a cornerstone of security strategy. 1. Make burden-sharing a central part of U.S. defense strategy with the United States not just helping allies to step up, but strongly encouraging them to do so. 2. Support greater spending and collaboration by Taiwan and allies in the Asia–Pacific like Japan and Australia to create a collective defense model. 3. Transform NATO so that U.S. allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent, and select other capabilities while reducing the U.S. force posture in Europe. 4. Sustain support for Israel even as America empowers Gulf partners to take responsibility for their own coastal, air, and missile defenses both individually and working collectively. 3. Directly counter Chinese economic power with all elements of national power in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean to maintain maritime freedom of movement and protect the digital infrastructure of nations in the region. Prioritize a denial defense against China.U.S. defense planning should focus on China and, in particular, the effective denial defense of Taiwan. “Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us. President Donald J. Trump, 2019 State of the Union Address” partner countries match the U.S. tariff rate under pressure from the American President, and then under Scenario Two, in which the U.S. matches the tariffs of partners that refuse to lower their tariffs. Project 2025 is itself a throwback to the Reagan/Gingrich drown the government era but as you say it’s doubtful Trump has even read the lengthy document. But I do think it’s valid to say that Trump is trying to revive Reagan rather than the more intellectual Nixon. And guess what…so was Obama. Almost all of our presidents are figureheads in one sense or another. They used to call Eisenhower “the great golfer.” That said, Trump’s motives seem a lot more obscure to me. Maybe we need a Ouija board. The US Navy’s main mission, as presented by a retired US Navy admiral in an article in War on the Rocks, is to restrict access of enemy vessels on the shipping lanes. The Freedom of Navigation and protection of shipping lanes blurb is just that. The truth is just the opposite. Good to see that for now the Northeast Passage is not disputed… The arctic sea passage is in the 2025 Project for strategic resources and shipping lane control. Which is why Trump is demanding that Canadians hand their country over to him – he wants their strategic resources and have control of those shipping lanes. If he was smart, he might have suggested a sort of North American Federation to do this by but instead he just wants a land grab with Canadian resources – which includes its people – to help balance the US bottom line financially i.e. an Anschluss. ‘As of March 17, 2025, Canada’s national net worth, the sum of national wealth and its net foreign asset position, is estimated at roughly $17.5 trillion.’ For some people, that would be pretty hefty payout if Trump ever did it. For the bulk number of Canadians however, they would be net losers big time. In the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr almost sixty years ago, “My country is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” The US already controls Panama via a massive military presence: it can ‘invade’ Panama from within at any time, as it did in 1989. The US also maintains a sizeable military presence in Greenland. Thule AFB, recently renamed Pituffik Space Base, is home to B52 nuclear bombers, one of which exploded there in 1968. So all this talk about owning or controlling Panama and Greenland is for show. The US already owns them. A good video discussion. https://conflictsforum.substack.com/p/europe-and-israel-decline-and-fragment Did I miss any reference to Ellesmere Island? Given what I’ve watched about Trump messups re laws, he problem misspelled “shopping lines” in an attempt to get people buying stuff. I’m tired of Trump already, let him have his dreams but we all know that with him it’s Israel first, last and always. Your email address will not be published.

Title: China Ramps Up Criticism of Li Ka-shing’s BlackRock Ports Deal

Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. With assistance from Alice Huang. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

By Joseph Ledford, Real Clear Wire March 15, 2025 A revitalized approach to hemispheric security has emerged in the early days of Donald Trump’s second term. “Americas First” is the principle, a strategic orientation to better position the United States for a renewal of the Pax Americana. Although skeptics fear a worldwide retrenchment, the Trump administration’s recommitment to the Western Hemisphere is not a retreat from global superpowerdom. Instead, the Trump administration has abandoned the inchoate universalism that prevents decision-makers from distinguishing between the nation’s core and peripheral interests. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are vital to security of the United States, and the Trump administration acts accordingly. Trump and his foreign policy hands Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz understand that, for America to project power globally, its neighborhood must be in order. In prioritizing the Western Hemisphere, Trump seeks to eradicate drug cartels, combat China’s malign influence, and strengthen America’s regional economic and security partnerships. These policy aims respond to the concerns and hopes of ordinary citizens while reasserting American influence in the Western Hemisphere.

In a bid to bring about regional security and prosperity, Trump’s second term has ushered in a restoration of the Monroe Doctrine. For without regional stability, how can the United States continue to support its allies and partners while confronting its adversaries? In conjunction with reducing illegal immigration, addressing the fentanyl crisis is Trump’s chief priority. On day one, Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of designating drug cartels and other transnational criminal organizations (TCO) as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT). On February 20, the State Department finalized the FTO and SDFT designations for six cartels and two transnational gangs. It gives the administration additional legal tools for limiting “material support or resources” and the ability to apply harsher economic sanctions. Trump’s efforts have catalyzed a whole-of-government response to the fentanyl crisis. The Department of Justice capitalized on the designations by dedicating resources to pursuing a “total-elimination policy.” The Central Intelligence Agency, for its part, ramped up its drone surveillance program in Mexico, from which it shares intelligence gathered on fentanyl manufacturing with Mexican authorities. US Northern Command also conducts surveillance operations on the American side of the border, and the 7th Special Forces Group has undertaken a training mission with the Mexican Marine Infantry. States have joined the initiative, too. Arizona launched Operation Desert Guardian to partner with the federal government in countering TCOs. To pressure Canada and Mexico into more aggressive anti-fentanyl efforts, Trump proposed a 25% tariff on their imports. As a result, Canada designated the cartels as FTOs and began Operation Blizzard to curb drug smuggling at the US-Canada border. Mexico dispatched 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border to fight narcotics trafficking, extradited 29 most wanted cartel members to America, and may impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Still, Trump prefers tougher measures, pressing Canada and Mexio for harder campaigns. With a trade war looming, and whiplash negotiations underway, Trump paused tariffs until April 2 on auto imports and goods in accordance with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Despite the contention among neighbors, however, a stronger North American Union against both the cartels and China appears within reach. The Trump administration should notch a strategic win before the diplomatic gambit turns irreversibly counterproductive. Such drastic policy changes and redeployment of key personnel and resources foreshadow a fatal confrontation. In the words of National Security Advisor Waltz, the United States will “unleash holy hell” on TCOs. What is more, narcotics have become a malevolent feature of US-China relations. The United States has entered a proxy war with China over the fentanyl crisis. America cannot degrade and destroy the cartels without confronting China for its financial and material contributions to their enterprise. China not only provides the precursor chemicals and pill press equipment needed to produce fentanyl, but also the money laundering services used to wash the profits. For now, Trump will impose tariffs on Chinese imports—but 20% will not compel a change in the Chinese Communist Party’s behavior. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded, “we’re ready to fight till the end.” Trump’s outreach to America’s neighbors demonstrates his predilection for confrontational but effective diplomacy. In late January, the unpopular Colombian President Gustavo Petro learned a hard geopolitical lesson. After Petro’s impromptu refusal to let repatriation flights land in Colombia, Trump threatened steep tariffs, which would ruin the Colombian economy at marginal cost to the United States. Petro folded immediately. Meanwhile, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino engaged in skirmish with Trump over the Panama Canal. In an opening move against China’s undue regional influence, Trump targeted the Chinese threat to the sovereignty of the Canal through dual-use infrastructure, namely the Ports of Balboa and Cristóbal operated by the Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison Holdings. Invoking the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties, Trump vowed on multiple occasions to reassert American control over the Canal, leading to a series of public barbs between Mulino and Trump. The conflict set the stage for Secretary Rubio’s inaugural trip abroad to put the administration’s “Americas First” approach into practice. In signaling the region’s significance, the secretary chose Central America and the Caribbean as his destination, a once-in-a-century kind of visit. There, Rubio bolstered regional strategic partnerships by securing a series of joint agreements with Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic on a host of issues, ranging from immigration and transnational crime to energy and economic development. Panama was first on Rubio’s itinerary, where he resolved the Canal issue. Notwithstanding the ongoing dispute over transit fees for US vessels, Mulino strived to honor the treaty and meet Trump’s demands for a sovereign Canal. Not only has Panama withdrawn from the Belt and Road Initiative but the Panama Canal Authority recently completed a Cyber Cooperation Arrangement with US Southern Command to shore up the Canal’s cybersecurity operations. Crucially, too, BlackRock negotiated a deal to buy the Balboa and Cristóbal ports from Hutchison. The agreement followed in the wake of Panama’s audit of the Hutchison contract, a lease that the Panamanian attorney general declared unconstitutional. Panama no longer wanted China to have a stake in the ports and American investors obliged, providing a viable alternative for the ownership of a key strategic asset. Here, one must disregard the political theatrics and examine the actions. Although neither Trump nor Mulino waivered in their rhetoric, US-Panamanian security cooperation strengthened and China’s influence diminished. In the end, the Trump administration achieved their aims. While the Trump administration embraces regional partners, old enemies of the United States get their just deserts. After Joe Biden’s relaxed Cuba policy, Trump instituted a harder line: relisting Cuba on list of State Sponsors of Terrorism; reactivating the LIBERTAD Act; reviving the Cuba Restricted List; and revamping visa restrictions on Cuban officials. Under his administration, the appendages of hostile foreign powers will not experience a reprieve until they meaningfully reform and break with America’s adversaries. Soon, for instance, the United States shall seek Nicaragua’s expulsion from the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement. In Venezuela, Trump initially gifted dictator Nicolás Maduro a détente opportunity, but Maduro botched it and maximum pressure returned. Trump sought a deal, whereby Venezuela accepted thousands of repatriations in exchange for him permitting Chevron to operate in Venezuela, a sanction exemption that Biden authorized to inspire democratic elections. On February 26, Trump announced he rescinded Chevron’s license because Maduro refused to comply with this arrangement, and he had not honored the election results. Days later, when a Venezuelan warship harassed ExxonMobil operations in Guayana, the State Department threatened “consequences for the Maduro regime.” Given Trump’s designs on regional security, and his willingness to tighten sanctions, Maduro’s dictatorship lives on borrowed time. To counter China and promote regional prosperity, the Trump administration also adopted a fresh approach to economic growth. Reviving a first-term economic program, América Crece 2.0 replaced Biden’s Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, which failed to evolve beyond a forum to discuss economic integration. Under América Crece 2.0, the State Department and the United States Trade Representative will leverage an upgraded U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to spur private capital investment in critical sectors while enhancing America’s six regional free trade agreements. In doing so, the Trump administration understands that American private capital offers the right antidote to state-led Chinese development in the Americas. Harnessing it for public-private partnerships will be the optimal way to extirpate Chinese influence via investment in the region. Yet not all policies herald a positive direction. The Biden administration saddled the Trump team with an intractable problem: Haiti. A collapsing Haiti represents a grave threat to the Caribbean and the United States. Rubio reaffirmed American support for the Multinational Security Support Mission led by Kenya, and US funding for it continues. The Trump administration recognizes the dire circumstances, but they possess limited options for solving Haiti’s civil strife before it devolves into a failed state. As Haiti spirals further into disorder, the deployment of American troops seems doubtful but could become unavoidable. Trump’s bid to put the Americas first corresponds with congressional goals. A champion of reasserting the Monroe Doctrine, Senator Jim Risch (R-ID), the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, worked to facilitate the making of a coherent, long-term policy for the Western Hemisphere. Two years of legislative toiling yielded a statutory requirement for the Trump administration to send Congress “a 5-year strategy to promote security and the rule of law in the Western Hemisphere.” Spearheaded by Risch, the Western Hemisphere Partnership Act became law in December through the National Defense Authorization Act. It mandates the secretary of state to submit the comprehensive strategy by mid-June to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The secretary must then provide yearly briefings on its implementation. Rubio, who co-sponsored the legislation as a senator, will craft this new strategy. It must deliver a practical framework for hemispheric defense and development. From China and the cartels to nearshoring industries and infrastructure development, the United States must solve acute challenges and take advantage of promising opportunities in the Western Hemisphere. The United States has arrived at an inflection point with great consequence for world order. The decisions made during Trump’s second term will reverberate in the next decades, especially in the Western Hemisphere. Whether on trade, development, crime or defense, the Trump administration must persist in reinvigorating America’s relationship with its neighbors to work toward solutions based on shared interests. This process may be rife with closed-door disagreements and public disputes, but the ultimate outcome will land the Western Hemisphere on a stronger footing for the 21st century. As the Trump administration reorients strategic focus on the Americas, regional partners should benefit from closer economic and security cooperation with the United States, while those countries actively engaged with China and its authoritarian partners against American interests should be deterred and isolated. American concerns are not always synonymous with those of every country in the Western Hemisphere, but an American-led hemispheric order safeguards the region’s economic and security interests. A secure and prosperous hemisphere augments the domestic determinants of American power. It will prove to be the wellspring of the Pax Americana revival. Joseph A.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

Title: The Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate — Part 2

Editor Tech Iain Davis, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout In continuing to unpack the ideologies of the oligarchs who are part of the new Trump administration, Iain Davis examines how their ideas are being translated into policy. He considers the consequent infrastructure rollout that is preparing the US and the world for an imminent Gov-corp Technate within a multipolar world. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the political philosophies that have long been adopted and promoted by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and considered the implications, given both men’s obvious influence on the Trump administration. Musk is a high-profile advocate of Technocracy, and Peter Thiel is an accelerationist neoreactionary who favours, in particular, the Dark Enlightenment. Before you read this article (Part 2), I urge you to familiarise yourself with the explanations of Technocracy and the NRx (the neoreactionary movement) provided in Part 1. Otherwise, many of the references here will lack context. As we noted in Part 1, Thiel and Musk are part of the oligarchic class by virtue of being invited to join a network led by other oligarchs whose stratospheric wealth far surpasses that of the names published on the “richest people in the world” lists. Welcomed into their exclusive club, Thiel and Musk are made men. In Part 2, we will explore how the political philosophies and the associated economic theories of Thiel and Musk are shaping public policy. Keep in mind that these two men are far from alone in attempting to create an American gov-corp Technate. Although they borrow some libertarian ideas, there is nothing truly “libertarian” about either technocrats or accelerationist neoreactionaries. Their convoluted theories, once applied, could not be more authoritarian, more anti-liberty. Just as it is an oxymoron to describe Musk as a “libertarian technocrat,” so is it absurd to think of Peter Thiel as an “anarcho-capitalist.” Yet propagandists persist in encouraging us to see them in these terms. Witness a 2014 article in The Atlantic titled “The Libertarian Capitalist’s Case for State Power and Making No Money.” It is possible that people like Thiel and Musk self-identify as libertarians because they think “liberty” means freedom granted by — and to — the oligarchy. In Part 1, we referenced the Venetian Republic. The Doge of Venice was the ruler of the banking, finance, and commercial empire of the Venetian Republic. That is to say, the Doge was given the liberty to rule by the oligarchs of the day. We might wonder if the naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (the DOGE) that Musk leads deliberately references the Venetian magistrate. Some say it does, while others suggest another possibility. Created as a joke in 2013 by cryptographers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin, a memecoin, has seen its price and market cap soar and fluctuate wildly thanks in no small measure to Elon Musk’s comments about it. Much of Musk’s talk about Dogecoin has been deliberately provocative. For example, in 2019 he declared himself the “former CEO of Dogecoin,” though that was never the case. His social media posts alone have provoked major changes in the price of Dogecoin. Musk has also aggressively hiked its value by, for instance, hinting it might become the basis of the proposed “X pay” payment system on his newly acquired ‘X’ platform — formerly Twitter. Musk encouraged bullish investment in Dogecoin. Of course, just because someone encourages you to do something that doesn’t negate your personal responsibility to conduct due diligence. When some investors lost their shirts, as Dogecoin prices tumbled, they tried to sue Musk in 2022 with a potential $258 billion class action lawsuit. The case was dismissed last year. The judge ruled that Musk’s comments were just “aspirational and puffery, not factual and susceptible to being falsified.” Though it is worth noting the offhand comments of one man took the Dogecoin from a literal joke — a crypto parody — to achieving a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion in 2021. If there is an in-joke to the naming of the DOGE, nominally led by Elon Musk, some argue it is Musk’s fondness for the Dogecoin that is reflected in the D.O.G.E acronym. Yet, the symbolism of “the Doge ”— one who is granted the liberty to rule by oligarchs — is perhaps more conspicuous. Just as with the term “Accelerator” — meaning high-impact investment to accelerate the growth of a startup — an obvious underpinning ideology is implied, even if rarely discussed. In the introduction to his 2012 treatise, “The Dark Enlightenment,” political philosopher Nick Land highlighted the importance of an article written three years earlier by oligarch Thiel. Land wrote: One milestone was the April 2009 discussion hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual forthrightness. Thiel summarized the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In a related article Thiel penned, titled “The Education of a Libertarian,” he was describing himself, and yet the personal philosophy he outlined in it was pure accelerationist neoreactionism. Thiel opined that “the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed,” given that the government’s response to every crisis was “more government.” He also claimed that the post-WWI deflationary depression in Western nations was the last “sharp but short” shock to have allowed the alleged advantages of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” to flourish. After that depression, he said, so-called “democratic” politics had stifled the opportunities to capitalise on crises. As a result, Thiel said he no longer believed “that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world.” Asserting, in so many words, that democracies were useless, Thiel announced he had found a new life goal: In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. For Thiel, the “unthinking demos” is us: the holders of the “neo-puritan faith” in progressive “social democracy” — the acolytes of the Cathedral (and the people whom Nick Land considers “inarticulate proles”). In Thiel’s view, we must embrace our “technoplastic” future, become intelligible, move beyond politics, and liberate capitalist innovation by swearing fealty to the gov-corp model. To this end, Thiel identified three “technological frontiers” upon which he could construct his darkly enlightened aristocracy.[1] Cyberspace was the first frontier he identified. There, Thiel focused on creating “a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution.” Cyberspace would enable “new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states” — and would result in a new world that would “force change on the existing social and political order.” [2] Outer space would be another Thiel frontier, where the “libertarian future of classic science fiction” could be built. [3] Seasteading would be his interim frontier, where the unclaimed oceans could be settled by humans. He called seasteading “more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel.” Seasteading would at least give us the time to develop the outer-space ideas on earth, prior to colonising the stars. These frontiers are necessary, Thiel insisted, because “we are in a deadly race between politics and technology.” He concluded: We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person [Trump?] who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. [Emphasis added.] Between 2006 and 2012, Thiel was instrumental in organising the Singularity Summits convened by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute — originally the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) — in partnership with Stanford University. Thiel provided much of the funding. Thiel cannot be both an advocate of accelerationist neoreaction and simultaneously an anarcho-capitalist — a libertarian. The two philosophies are mutually exclusive. In Part 1, we noted the technocrats’ rejection of the notion that “all men are created equal.” In a similar vein, Land, Yarvin, Fisher, and other accelerationists consider it essential to have a ruling entity, which can only be comprised of a few human beings exercising an unequal, additional right to rule. Both the technocrats and the accelerationists fundamentally misunderstand, or misinterpret, what the Preamble to The Declaration of Independence means. They completely ignore the second clause of the relevant declaration — namely, “that they [human beings] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” “Equality,” in real libertarian thinking, does not infer a held belief that everyone is the same — though that is certainly how technocrats interpret the word. Libertarian “equality” doesn’t deny that people have relative strengths and weaknesses. It is not a rejection of either leadership or possible forms of meritocracy. It self-evidently means that every human being has an equal right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” These rights are unalienable — or inalienable. Our rights are not decided for us by others or limited by others, and no one on earth has any more or any fewer “equal rights” than anyone else. This idea is not difficult to grasp. It is central to the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, as clearly enunciated by Murray Rothbard (1926–1995): [N]o man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or property of anyone else. Anarcho-capitalism wholeheartedly rejects the initiation of the use of force — the aggressive imposition of claimed authority — by the state to coerce individual persons or seize their property. An example is the threat of fining or imprisoning someone who hasn’t paid taxes to the “proper” authorities. Anarcho-capitalism resoundingly rejects the state and all its dictatorial demands. By contrast, the proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise. Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. The term “technopopulism,” coined by political theorists Christopher Bickerton and Carlo Accetti, has increasingly been bandied about. While the US voters who elected Trump were offered technopopulist promises, this was clearly a sales pitch to entice them to support a gov-corp Technate. “Populism” can be broadly defined as a political attempt to “appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” “Technocracy” is commonly said to mean “a government or social system that is controlled or influenced by experts in science or technology.” Neither left-wing nor right-wing, technopopulism promises a new kind of politics based on the belief that the more limited role of elected politicians is to put the appropriate teams of experts together to guide policy and to find technological solutions to social and economic problems, thereby benefiting “ordinary people.” But the apparent technopopulist offer to retain democratic accountability in the US is a deceit. The technopopulists say they want to unleash “technocracy” — with a small “t” — for the public good. But the new government system they propose is constructing “Technocracy” — with a big “T” — to serve the interests of the “American elites.” This is evident from The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (aka The 2025 Presidential Transition Project), Promise to America. It claims its purpose is to “defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America.” While defanging and defunding woke warriors holds allure for American voters, the Project 2025 methodology actually subverts US “representative democracy.” The Trump administration is evidently closely allied with Project 2025 — denials notwithstanding. One such obvious tie: Trump has nominated Russell Vought to return to the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, by no coincidence, Vought was a key figure in convening the Project 2025 initiative. Project 2025 contributors were influential in Trump’s first administration and are no less conspicuous in his current picks for office. Project 2025 sets a presidential agenda for the first 180 days in office that seeks to empower the executive branch to meet these key goals: dramatically reduce the size of the public sector bureaucracy; privatise and deregulate the functions of the state; and liberate American technological innovation by “shuttering” it off from the China tech sector’s alleged infiltration. Thus, according to Project 2025, US technology can, if applied properly, be used to resolve all manner of social problems—from anti-American inequality of opportunity in the education system to woke propaganda infesting the media. In other words, American technology produced by Americans and for Americans can supply every long-sought answer to America’s ills. The power of American AI can be set free to, for example, police social media and tackle abuses such as Medicare fraud. Project 2025 offers the additional justification that the US is in an AI arms race with China and, therefore, must invest in AI accordingly. Trump issued a slew of executive orders following his inauguration. These days, this is not an unusual practice for an incoming US president. However, Trump’s EOs were clearly heavily influenced by Project 2025. Ironically, The Heritage Foundation and its Project 2025 are bankrolled by some of the “elites” the project accuses of betraying Americans. The Coors, Koch, Uihlein, Barre Seid, Bradley, and Scaiffe families are among the financial backers of both the Foundation and Project 2025. Rather than technopopulists it is the “TechnoKings” (see Part 1) who have been “assisting” Trumps selection of his administration’s personnel. Musk’s influence is well known but Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is another influencer. Andreessen has not just been involved in making Trump’s picks for technology and economic related positions — areas where he perhaps has some expertise — but also for US defense and intelligence posts. Andreessen’s Machiavellian reasons for supporting Trump are obvious. As reported by the Verge, in July 2024 Andreessen spelled out that he and his partners were backing Trump, not because they shared any of the concerns voiced by Republican voters, but because they could use the Trump administration to deliver the regulatory environment they wanted for their project to succeed. That project is a gov-corp Technate. Not technopopulism but Techno-Optimism. In 2023, Marc Andreessen published The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. He explained precisely why he and his TechKing partners have seized their opportunity: We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. [. . .] We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. [. . .] We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [. . .] Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.[. . .] We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to [. . .] ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. [. . .] We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral, [. . .] as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems. [. . .] We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone. [. . .] We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. This is pure accelerationist neoreaction strongly influence by Technocracy. It is Nick Land and notably not Curtis Yarvin that Andreessen considers among the “Patron Saints” of Techno-Optimism. People like Thiel, Andreessen, and Musk are serious. They want to implement the Dark Enlightenment and are hell-bent on establishing gov-corp Technates. Their oligarch network is indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Currently, the most powerful nation on earth is in their hands. In true technopopulist fashion, it is perhaps Andreessen’s identification of gov-corp enemies that is most revealing: Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now. The eradication of these “enemies” reads like an American voters’ wish-list. Ridding themselves of the globalist’s overreach exercised through institutions like the WHO, the WEF, the UN and even NATO, is what they seemingly voted for. Andreessen attempt to associate ideas like “sustainability,” “stakeholder capitalism” and even “social responsibility” with communism is, at best, wrong, but appears to be disingenuous and mere pandering. This is the Dark Enlightenment’s technopopulist sales pitch. Escaping the grasp of the oligarchs was obviously a vote winner. But the American public has not escaped, on the contrary it has fallen into the clutches of the most authoritarian oligarchs imaginable. Oligarchs who, perhaps for the first time in history, not only have the political authority but the technology to make their gov-corp Technates a reality. This is a clear and present danger to all of us. Not just Americans. The same commitment to accelerationism and creative destruction is evident everywhere. In essence, gov-corp is the ultimate public-private partnership — a kind of inverted fascism where the private stakeholders use the claimed authority and violence of the state to achieve their goals. The construction of Technates is not limited to the US. Arguably China, for example, is already operating a public-private Technocracy. What is happening under our noses is no libertarian dream realized. It is the construction of an all-cognizant, all-controlling, all-consuming global network of gov-corp Technates overseen by a bureaucracy of multiple poles. On the surface, the new brand of technopopulist politics we’ve been examining seems to be anti-Establishment. At least, that’s how it’s being presented. It will use high-tech solutions and AI analysis to, for instance, deliver “lower taxes, much cheaper energy (green and fossil), faster growth and a productivity revolution.” Lest we forget, it will “make America great again” (MAGA). The trouble with this pipe dream, though, is that the ostensible “technopopulists” and avowed neoreactionaries behind it are actually installing Big “T” Technocracy and gov-corp as their solution. Not MAGA, but “Dark MAGA.” In 2020 Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen , and Coinbase established the low tax, low regulation nascent city state called Próspera on the island of Roatán in Honduras. The promotional blurb for Próspera read: Próspera is a startup city with a regulatory system designed for entrepreneurs to build better, cheaper, and faster than anywhere else in the world. The current Honduras government considers Próspera’s claim to enjoy special economic and regulatory status illegal. The previous Honduras administration under Juan Orlando Hernández (JOH) — who was later convicted of drug smuggling in the US — initially created three so-called Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs) of which Próspera is one. The initiative was fiercely opposed by the people of Honduras. The ZEDEs create a “special regime” where investors — Pronomos Capital (Thiel, Andreessen, etc.) — have absolute control of “fiscal, security and conflict resolution policy.” For all intents and purposes, the ZEDEs are startup gov-corps. In 2022, the incoming administration of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento started the process of repealing the ZEDE legislation. This is proving difficult because the Próspera ZEDE framework has a fifty year “built to last” clause in it guaranteeing the project for that period. Gov-corp investors instigated an $11 billion law suit to stop the Honduras government’s attempts to stymie their ambitions. The technocrat oligarchs deployed the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) mechanism against the elected government of Honduras. It is not unreasonable to describe their action as a direct threat to bankrupt the entire nation. As we’ll discuss, these oligarchs are not “nice” people. Whether they call themselves Christian or not. Many of the Próspera trademarks are held by NeWay Capital LLC, founded by Erick Brimen and Trey Goff. NeWay Capital formed the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which is similarly backed by Pronomos Capital — Thiel, Andreessen, Coinbase et al. In 2023, Trump proposed establishing ten so called “Freedom Cities” in the US. The mainstream media focused on his comments about “flying cars,” but he was really talking about embryonic gov-corp Technates. Reportedly, the FCC is now supposedly “in discussion” with the Trump administration to create gov-corp Technates across the US. Trey Goff said “the energy in DC is absolutely electric” and the ambition was to create “not just ten, but as many as the market can handle.” If approved by Congress, these “startup nations” — neoreactionary realms — will be city states like Próspera. The FCC calls these “special districts” Prosperity Zones. The technopopulist offer is to unleash innovation, onshore employment opportunities and revitalise the American economy. The FCC objective is to “accelerate the development of new urban centers.” Freedom Cities will operate in de facto US ZEDEs. The objective is to remove all regulation and allow tech-oligarchs the freedom to do whatever they like. These will be cities without limits, say the FCC and will be “zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, [. . .] allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity.” The accelerationist neoreactionaries and the technocrats are racing ahead. As evidenced by Andreessen’s Techno-Optimist Manifesto, there is no doubt what they have in mind. In 2022, Balaji Srinivasan — former Andreessen Horowitz general partner and former chief technology officer for Coinbase — published his book The Network State: How to Start a New Country. In it, he outlined the neoreactionary strategy to “escape politics in all its forms” and enable tech-billionaire oligarchs to form their own sovereign states—sov-corps. There is nothing pro-American about the NRx’s collective vision. Srinivasan wants the proposed “startup nations” to secede from the US and considers the US outdated and obsolescent. Shortly we’ll discuss Trump’s peculiar and seemingly unilateral declaration that his administration is intent upon grabbing Greenland — and Gaza apparently. We are supposed to believe that it is Trump who wants Greenland (and perhaps Gaza); that Trump is the great strategist playing some sort of 5D geopolitical chess game. But it is Peter Thiel and his oligarch network that wants to build a gov-corp Technate called Praxis on Greenland. The people of Greenland should be wary. There is no legal limit to the “built to last” territorial expansion of Próspera and the TechnoKing oligarchs have the backing of the World Bank to make sure their project does last. Following Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times published an adversarial interview with aforementioned political theorist of the neoreactionary movement (NRx) Curtis Yarvin. Outlining Yarvin’s contention that the US should be run as a corporate monarchy (gov-corp) under the leadership of an all-powerful CEO (Trump), Times‘ writer and interviewer David Marchese formulated his arguments on the suspected racist aspects of Yarvin’s ideology. The pair debated nothing of notable interest. The piece allowed Yarvin to forward some of his ideas to a wider public — but without disclosing any of their appalling implications. Meanwhile, the Times‘ Marchese posited a practically irrelevant counterargument. The legacy media is not going to point out those appalling implications. But this is what Yarvin, the leader of the NRx admired by Peter Thiel and other neoreactionary oligarchs, had proposed in 2008 under his pen name, Mencius Moldburg: Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma. The best humane alternative to genocide I can think of is not to liquidate the wards [people]—either metaphorically or literally—but to virtualize them. A virtualized human is in permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. This would drive him insane, except that the cell contains an immersive virtual-reality interface which allows him to experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world. The suspected racist streak in Yarvin does matter when we consider the implications of his gov-corp philosophy. But to imagine that identity politics provides any kind of intellectual basis to tackle the NRx dooms all such opposition to failure. If the objective is to resist accelerationist neoreaction, then harping on about the divisions between the progressive left and the right-wing — or “alt-right” — serves no useful purpose. Such arguments don’t even come close to comprehending what the Dark Enlightenment is. They only deflect the public from paying vital attention to real threats. The Dark Enlightenment is not racist. It is anti-human race. Its advocates do not care what colour gov-corp’s customers are. They seek, rather, to transform all of humanity, to bring an end to what it is to be a sovereign human being. Musk has already stated his desire to transform his X platform into a payment service provider and finance portal that, he hopes, could become “half of the world’s financial system.” Thanks in part to the headway made by Facebook’s Libra (Diem) project — more in this shortly — in 2023, Musk was able to start applying for the necessary regulatory approval for his financial domination project. Via its “Digital State” — again, we’ll cover this in a moment — Ukrainians are the Digital State’s “customers.” Musk wants to X to form the basis of a worldwide Digital State in which all users will be customers. Citizens as customers of government services is a key component of the gov-corp structure that neoreactionaries like Thiel and Andreessen desire. Just as we see the rise of the accompanying “accelerators” everywhere, so to the description of us as “customers” is seeping into the lexicon of governments the world over. In 2019, the US multinational corporation IBM, whose operations make it the largest industrial research organization in the world and whose chequered history includes assisting the Nazis to perpetrate a holocaust, explained why we all need to consider ourselves the customers of our governments: Today’s society is changing at a record pace as companies worldwide develop innovative solutions designed to make the world a more efficient and sustainable place. [. . .] Apps provide us with personalized information based on geolocation; we can shop online from the comfort of our couch, and organize our finances on our smartphones.[. . .] [I]t’s time to rethink and reinvent public sector services, [. . .] a digital reinvention helps build trust in the public sector as a brand: the government has your back. [. . .] At IBM, we’re there to guide you through the current age of digital reinvention. IBM, alongside CIA-linked Oracle, is a partner of the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is assisting it to “accelerate transformation” to a new digital DWP service. For its part, as it proceeds to make a £6 billion cut, the UK DWP has stopped winter fuel payments to pensioners and has committed to freezing and restricting access to disability payments to the disabled. It is effectively lowering unemployment benefits for the sick and disabled and tightening the eligibility criteria for nearly all state benefits. At the same time, the UK government is pushing through the Terminally-ill Adults (End of Life) Bill — commonly referred to as the Assisted Dying Bill — to make it easier for the state to kill people who just can’t take it any more. All of this, according to the DWP, is part of its drive to provide a better “customer experience.” In 2021, The Biden administration issued Executive Order 14058 to improve the US federal government’s customer’s experience. Consequently, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS): [. . .] every person who pays taxes or uses Medicare is a customer of the federal government. Every veteran who uses a VA facility is a customer, every government employee that fills out their timesheet is a customer. The “customer experience” is how people experience and perceive our government services. It is what happens at the touchpoints when someone interacts with a government service. The customer experience can be a single touchpoint or several over a longer relationship between the “customer” and government. Each touchpoint is an opportunity for a positive interaction that adds up to a positive customer experience. The mainstream media is avidly pushing the idea that politicians like Trump are in charge. But, not only does EO 14058 illustrate the clear shift towards NRx gov-corp aligned thinking, it also shows that the transformation is not dependent on whatever administration happens to be in office at the time. Gov-corp represents the underlying philosophy driving this governance reinvention. Technocracy is the operating system for the impending Technates, regardless of who you vote for. The shift to digital money and “digital states” is key to the reimagining of society. Rather like the WeChat “everything app” in China, which operates as a public-private partnership between the government and Tencent — enabling the technocratic state to directly influence an estimated 1.3 billion Chinese customers –– the size of the X user-base gives Musk’s network an opportunity to construct his version of an everything app digital state. With an estimated 600 million users, Musk’s team is ready to launch his platform’s X-money payment system. It seems Musk doesn’t anticipate any regulatory problems, as another building block of the X-digital state is dropped into place. As X moves toward becoming a “comprehensive financial services hub,” working in partnership with Visa, the plan is to reportedly integrate digital currencies into the X-money system by the end of the year. The new interoperable global monetary system that is emerging has been designed to perpetuate the same old monetary game with the added benefit of AI surveillance and behavioural control. Investors can speculate — engaging in creative destruction — while protecting their digital finance empires by storing value in new digital reserve assets, almost certainly bitcoin. A so-called Synthetic Hegemonic Currency can and is being created, primarily using USD-denominated stablecoins underwritten by US debt. In contrast to the investor experience, it is unlikely to benefit many of its customers. Contemplating new methods of genocide to rid yourself of whomever you find “undesirable” is something we associate with tyrannical megalomaniacs not egalitarian democratic “leaders.” Unfortunately, certainly in the US, it seems the maniac tyrants have the upper hand. As many Unlimited Hangout readers already know, Thiel received investment funds from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel to accelerate Palantir. Part of that arrangement was for Palantir to establish a public-private partnership that would rescue a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Total Information Awareness (renamed the Terrorism-IA program in 2003). The purpose of the TIA was to create an all-pervasive US surveillance and population control system, with a heavy focus on pre-crime and other “predictive” interventions that would allow the state to justify any policy it chooses. The TIA project faltered when the US public learned of its intentions. State funding was officially withdrawn — which simply meant that the “less controversial” aspects continued under the guise of combating terrorism while the controversial projects went darker still. Ever since 9/11, “terrorism” has been the convenient PR buzz word for covering up a multitude of illegalities. The TIA program continued, unabated, to spy on the entire US population as a public-private partnership. Shortly after incorporating Palantir in 2003, Thiel and Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp reportedly met with the TIA’s chief architect, John Poindexter. The pair apparently impressed upon Poindexter that they shared his vision of a US domestic digital gulag. Yet, unlike TIA, which had been housed at the Pentagon’s DARPA, they would develop the TIA system as a private entity. According to New York magazine, Thiel and Karp convinced Poindexter that Palantir would “pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions.” Evidently, In-Q-Tel’s seed funding followed soon thereafter. The CIA remained Palantir’s sole client until 2008. That is to say, Palantir enjoyed a monopoly due to its partnership with the state. Although Thiel’s cadre at PayPal — often called the PayPal Mafia — is supposedly responsible for ousting Musk from the company’s CEO spot, the rift between the two men seems somewhat overstated. Just as it is clear Musk hankers to install Technocracy, Thiel’s passion for the Dark Enlightenment is equally unambiguous. Both ideologies are mutually reinforcing. While there are some apparent tensions between Musk and Thiel, they are on the same path. Yarvin, for one, certainly values Musk’s contribution. Thiel and Musk are already megarich magnates on the order of the robber barons of old. As such, their respective Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy dreams, when realized, are intended to make them “sovereigns” of what Yarvin calls a “patchwork of realms.” The shared view of technocrats and neoreactionaries that society would be better if it were ruled by the likes of Musk and Thiel is an absurd and dangerous folly. We shouldn’t labour under any illusions that they’re nice. Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Lucky is another Thiel protégé who, having sold his Oculus VR headset business to Mark Zuckerberg, moved into the war business with the help of Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Through Anduril, Thiel is investing in a defence technology that maximises AI’s ability to kill. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk have both been instrumental in the development of AI. They combined forces in 2015 to accelerate Thiel protégé Sam Altman’s OpenAI as a “non-profit” research company. Today, propelled by the success of its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, OpenAI is valued at around $160 billion. Consequently, its “for profit” subsidiary, OpenAI Global LLC, is poised to make fantastic profits. OpenAI was pitched as a tool for developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole.” Presumably, OpenAI’s defence contracts and its participation in the Silicon Valley consortium bid to dominate the US military-industrial complex reflect this principled commitment. Or perhaps the ethical stance of the team behind OpenAI is about as plausible as their “non-profit” pretensions. There is every reason not to trust hypocrites like Thiel and Musk. One of those reasons is Palantir’s encroachment into national health-data systems, which is creating a virtual healthcare data monopoly in some countries — including the UK. This is extremely concerning, because it is obvious that patient care — or even basic human compassion — is not a priority for Thiel’s Palantir. There is nothing “Christian” about Thiel’s conduct. On the contrary, Palantir has actively participated in Israel’s Palestinian genocide and in the almost-complete destruction of the Palestinians’ healthcare system. In January 2024, Thiel and Palantir CEO Alex Karp agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and signed a deal with the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) to “harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of war-related missions.” Of this deal the British Medical Journal observed: IOF operations have been described as a “war on hospitals” because of the systematic destruction of Gaza’s entire health system and 943 IOF attacks on healthcare. Hundreds of health workers have been detained, tortured, and killed. In addition to directly attacking healthcare, ongoing bombardment, forced displacement of Palestinians, and near complete siege of Gaza, the IOF has created a severe health and humanitarian crisis with high rates of malnutrition, infectious disease, famine, and dehydration. Several Thiel-backed companies — Palantir (seed-funded by In-Q-Tel),Anduril and digital surveillance company Clearview AI — have all evidently used the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a test bed for their technology. As noted by Stavroula Pabst in her Unlimited Hangout article, “How Peter Thiel-Linked Tech is Fueling the Ukraine War,” these companies are “taking advantage of the conflict to develop controversial AI-driven weapons systems and facial recognition technologies, perhaps transforming both warfare and AI forever.” Despite Thiel’s self-described libertarian and Christian beliefs, Pabst noted that the net impact of his venture capitalism couldn’t be more inhuman: [T]hese Thiel-backed groups’ involvement in war serves to develop not only problematic and unpredictable weapons technologies and systems, but also apparently to advance and further interconnect a larger surveillance apparatus formed by Thiel and his elite allies’ collective efforts across the public and private sectors, which arguably amount to the entrenchment of a growing technocratic panopticon aimed at capturing public and private life. Within the context of Thiel’s growing domination over large swaths of the tech industry, apparent efforts to influence, bypass or otherwise undermine modern policymaking processes, and anti-democratic sentiments, Thiel-linked organizations’ activities in Ukraine can only signal a willingness to shape the course of current events and the affairs of sovereign nations alike. Though Pabst’s piece was written in October 2023, her prescient observations have certainly been playing out. As we embark on 2025, it is clear that Thiel and Musk are among a troop of tech titans who have ingratiated themselves with the Trump administration. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. On their own, the ideologies of communitarianism, stakeholder capitalism, Technocracy, the Dark Enlightenment, and any other political ideology amount to little more than academic musings. Once implemented through the power and authority illegitimately claimed by the state, however, they couldn’t be more significant. Thiel has heavily backed current Vice President JD Vance and other Republican political candidates, such as Blake Masters, who co-authored Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future with Thiel in 2014. There is a nexus of Thiel protégés surrounding the new Trump administration. It is hard to see how Vance could rise to what some call the second-most-powerful position in the US were it not for the career-long support he has received from Thiel. As Thiel’s man, Vance’s admiration for the Dark Enlightenment is transparent. Adopting Yarvin’s “Retire All Government Employee” (RAGE) motto, which now seems to be embodied by the DOGE, Vance suggested that a future Trump administrator should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, [and] replace them with our people.” In 2017, Buzzfeed published extracts from the dump of an email exchange between Curtis Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis. In one email, Yarvin revealed that he had watched the 2016 US election results with Thiel and said that Thiel was “fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.” In his 2021 book, The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, Bloomberg Technology writer Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” according to a July 2024 article by Gil Duran in The New Republic. Of course, Thiel does not want it widely known that he supports the Dark Enlightenment of the NRx. With its aim to destroy the political realm and replace it with a corporate monarchy, the Dark Enlightenment, if fully understood by the public, would outrage them and would be, for Thiel, a PR disaster. Despite the potential for that to happen, Yarvin’s ideas continue to influence him. One such crazy notion was revealed by Yarvin in his talk at the March 2012 BIL Conference (an alternative to TED). Speaking as Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin advocated for gov-corp: There is no difference between a CEO and a dictator. If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia. Just a few weeks later, Thiel gave a lecture at Stanford, where he said: A startup is basically structured as a monarchy. We don’t call it that, of course. That would seem weirdly outdated, and anything that’s not democracy makes people uncomfortable. We are biased toward the democratic-republican side of the spectrum. That’s what we’re used to from civics classes. But the truth is that startups and founders lean toward the dictatorial side because that structure works better for startups. Ten days prior to Trump’s inauguration, Thiel used the Financial Times as an outlet to pontificate about the second-term President’s second-time promises to disclose details of the Kennedy assassination plot and to protect free speech, etc. Time will tell if these promises are kept. In the same article, Thiel laid bare the lineage of his own philosophy: Darker questions still emerge in these dusky final weeks of our interregnum. [. . .] The future demands fresh and strange ideas. New ideas might have saved the old regime, which barely acknowledged, let alone answered, our deepest questions — the causes of the 50-year slowdown in scientific and technological progress. Certainly from 2009 onward, Thiel has viewed politics as a vehicle to promote his accelerationist NRx-aligned objectives. Not because he particularly shares the values of any political party, either Democrat or Republican — or, for that matter, Libertarian — but because he recognises that people are programmed to feel comfortable as long as they believe whatever they support has something to do with “democracy.” Remember, Thiel calls us the “unthinking demos.” In 2014, reporting the evidence of some of the other links between Yarvin and Thiel, Corey Pein, writing for The Baffler, accurately lumped Thiel in with the NRx and called them collectively a bunch of “mouthbreathing Machiavellis.” Responding to Pein’s piece, Thiel said, according to an article published shortly thereafter in The New York Times: Actually, I found that vaguely flattering. [. . .] It was the full-on conspiracy theory. In truth, there’s nobody sitting around plotting the future, though sometimes I think it would be better if people were. This was blatant baloney. Thiel well knows there are people “sitting around plotting the future.” He himself maintains a web of connections with the plotters of which he speaks — and is obviously one of them. Thiel, as President of Thiel Capital, sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. The steering committee sets the agenda for the secretive Bilderberg Meetings where around 130 selected globalist delegates debate policy initiatives behind closed doors. Palantir CEO, Thiel’s associate Alex Karp, is also on the steering committee, as is former chair and CEO of Google Eric Schmidt and the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. Consequently, it isn’t surprising that the main topic for debate at the last 2024 Bilderberg meeting was Artificial Intelligence (AI). Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been selected as the chair for the next Bilderberg Meeting and will also serve as chair of the next Munich Security Conference (MSC). The UK Guardian reports that his appointment marks a moment where the “influential” Bilderberg group is contributing toward the “concentration of control at the top of the Atlantic alliance.” Noting that Bilderberg brings together “prime ministers, EU commissioners, bank bosses, corporate CEOs and intelligence chiefs,” it was ridiculous for Thiel — a senior Bilderberger — to feign ignorance of those who evidently are “plotting the future.” Yarvin, in the earlier-referenced interview with David Marchese in The New York Times, was asked what he meant when he said Thiel was “fully enlightened”: Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. [. . .] It’s a disenchantment from believing in these old systems. And the thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, Oh, we need to do things Curtis’s [or Peter’s] way. It’s basically just a greater openness of mind. Sure, the Dark Enlightenment rejects the “old systems” — i.e., representative democracy — but Yarvin’s diplomatic response cannot hide the fact that Thiel and other members of the NRx evidently know what they want to replace it with: gov-corp overseeing a network of sovcorp-managed functional sequences in a Technate instead of within existing nation-states. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. Obviously, any sane person would welcome the end of hostilities, but there is a clear subtext to the US policy shift. The Trump administration has emphasised the US potential deal with Ukraine to access Ukraine’s possible rare earth metal deposits as a “win” for US voters. He told the US public that there were “$500B worth of rare earth” in Ukraine. This is highly speculative. While Ukraine certainly has a lot of coal, oil, gas and uranium, much if that is in territory currently occupied by the Russian Federation. The estimates of rare earth metal deposits in extant Ukrainian territory were made around half a century ago and some, such as independent energy and mining consultant Tony Mariano, have significant doubts about the commercial viability or even the presence of the alleged deposits: As far as I know, there are no economically viable rare earth deposits in Ukraine. I have evaluated clay deposits that I thought had potential, but I found that they are not viable. This does not mean that there are none, but that more exploration and evaluation is needed. With regard to the minerals deposits that are known to exist in Russia’s “new territories,” including any possible if unlikely rare-earth deposits, Russian president Vladimir Putin has indicated his willingness to collaborate with the US again. In the spirit of public-private partnership (stakeholder capitalism), Putin told journalist Pavel Zarubin that Russia was ready “to offer [cooperation] to our American partners – when I say partners, I mean not only administrative and government structures, but also companies.” While Russians and Ukrainians continued to die, Kirill Dmitriev, former Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and WEF investment guru, and the current CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund — appointed in 2023 by Putin as special representative of the Russian president for investment — said that US energy corporations would welcome “access to Russian natural resources.” In 2014, the US enabled and supported Ukrainian Nazis (the Right Sector and others) to orchestrate the violent Euromaidan Coup that overthrew the elected president Victor Yanukovich. Ukrainian Nazi atrocities in Odessa and Mariupol immediately followed and marked the start of an eight-year-long war that Russian forces officially entered in 2022. From the moment Russia began its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US response was focused on seizing economic, financial and resource control of Ukraine in exchange for bolstering its military. It is not unreasonable to observe that Russian intervention enabled the US public-private partnership to capture Ukraine. With the Russian government now looking forward to working with its US partners, and given that the US state was instrumental in instigating the current conflict, one has to wonder what this war has really been about. Large US corporations, such as Microsoft and Amazon, began the process of digitising the Ukrainian government on February 24th 2022, the day Russia is said to have “invaded” Ukraine. This process has since seen Ukraine become a world leader in “digital democracy.” Ukrainian citizens are being coerced towards accepting digital ID, digital payments and into total reliance on digital infrastructure for many of their everyday needs. This has been met with great enthusiasm from globalist think tanks, such as The Centre for International Governance Innovation. As Ukrainian energy and technological infrastructure became more reliant on US corporations, global investors — through the asset management giant BlackRock — agreed to deals with the Ukrainian government to “structure the nation’s reconstruction funds.” In November 2022 BlackRock announced: BlackRock FMA [Financial Markets Advisory] will advise the MoE [Ukraine Ministry of Economy] on establishing a roadmap for the investment framework’s implementation, including identifying design choices for the envisioned setup, structure, mandate and governance. The MoU [Memorandum of Understanding] formalizes the discussions the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, held in September on the possibilities of driving public and private investments into Ukraine. The WEF arranged further meetings between Zelensky’s administration and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alongside a consortium of investors represented by executives from BlackRock, Bridgewater Associates, Carlyle Group, Blackstone, Dell, ArcelorMittal, and others. With the financial architecture in place, and US and other multinational corporations set to capitalise, the emphasis shifted in early 2024 towards reducing the investment risk. War is the preferred business model for private military contractors (PMCs – mercenaries), or International Defense Companies (IDCs) as they are called in Ukraine. With Ukrainian government legislation in the pipeline to legalise IDCs operating in post-war Ukraine — coinciding with the Pentagon’s decision to ease restrictions supposedly placed on US PMCs (IDCs) working in Ukraine — US PMCs are just one corner of the US military industrial complex set to exploit the thirty-five-fold increase in the Ukrainian defence market created by Russia’s “invasion.” This is yet another tantalising Ukraine war opportunity for multinational financiers, such as BlackRock’s investors for example. Obviously, a “post-war” Ukraine is needed to turn these investment opportunities into solid ventures. With the US public-private stakeholder invasion of Ukraine complete, and the Russian public-private stakeholders ready to do business, Ukraine finds itself in a precarious position. It is almost completely in the hands of US corporations. For example, Ukraine is now heavily reliant on Musk’s Starlink for its internet connectivity and other communication systems. Indeed Ukraine’s “digital democracy” is now largely controlled by oligarchs like Musk. The Ukrainian Diia app is the product of a joint project between the CIA front organisation USAID and the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation which named Diia the literal Digital State. Diia is an “everything app.” It ties Ukrainian citizens to a centralised digital control system (Diia) through which they access government services. Their digital IDs and digital passports, driving licenses, fine levies and payments, their tax returns, tax accounts, their mRNA vaccine certificates and more can all be overseen by the Digital State. Of course, the overwhelming priority is to end the war. From a humanitarian perspective, at this point, nothing could be more important. Trump will almost certainly be credited if his apparent diplomacy succeeds and this will surely be perceived as more evidence of his great leadership by his supporters. We are supposed to believe that the Ukraine government’s stalling over Trump’s deal for US corporations’ access to Ukrainian rare earth deposits is the reason why the US has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s Starlink connectivity. The privatisation of a state like Ukraine couldn’t be more dangerous for its people. Musk was quick to point out that he could personally end Ukraine’s war effort, claiming the Ukrainian military’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.” He later added this is something he would not do. Though obviously, given the Dogecoin debacle, Musk’s team fully comprehend the impact his comments have. In truth, there is a vast network of international investors looking at a post-war Ukraine with avarice. The rare earth deal is a sideshow to keep the public bemused. The whole nation state of Ukraine is ripe for the picking and the transition to a US satellite gov-corp Technate is already well underway. As previously noted, one of Peter Thiel’s long-term ambitions has been to create “a new world currency.” Fortuitously, one of Trump’s first executive orders was aimed at strengthening US leadership in digital financial technology. In it, he promised his voter base that he would prohibit “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] within the jurisdiction of the United States.” But there is a caveat: The order “shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” As we know, legislative “laws” are subject to change at any time. Trump included in this EO a US government commitment to promote and protect “the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” [Emphasis added.] As extensively reported in the four-part investigative series on the cryptocurrency industry published last November by Unlimited Hangout writers Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin, rather than averting the societal risks associated with CBDC, Trump’s January 23rd executive order arguably portends something far worse. As Webb and Goodwin pointed out: [T]he policy of the Federal Reserve since last year has made it clear that they favor “private stablecoin issuance rather than official CBDC issuance.” With stablecoins being just as programmable and surveillable as CBDCs, and some stablecoin issuers like Tether already allied with U.S. intelligence and security agencies, the current stablecoin bill is poised to pave the way for the U.S.’ de facto CBDC and to ensure that Wall Street and well-established titans of digital finance like PayPal have the advantage. In particular, Thiel, PayPal, Facebook (now Meta), and US financial regulators have, for some time, been preparing for “a new world currency.” In order to understand the process they have been setting up, we first need to consider how this public-private partnership has apparently shaped the financial regulatory framework in the US. Thiel emphasised the “new world currency” idea in his aforementioned 2009 article, “The Education of a Libertarian” (the piece, you may remember, that influenced Nick Land’s conceptualisation of the Dark Enlightenment). In that piece, he wrote: [T]he founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. Peter Thiel sat on the Meta (Facebook) board of directors until 2022, when he left to reportedly “focus on political endeavours.” Upon his departure, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his personal gratitude to Thiel for “teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.” In 2019, under Thiel’s evident influence, Facebook announced its intention to launch a stablecoin payment system called Libra, which it soon renamed Diem. The project was co-headed by David A. Marcus, who moved to Facebook from PayPal in 2014, and by Morgan Beller, who migrated from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Libra appears to have failed. But, as Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin explain, that interpretation depends upon what one views the purpose of Libra (Diem) to have actually been. With an estimated two billion-plus Facebook users worldwide, if Libra had succeeded, it would have represented the potential “end of monetary sovereignty” as far as central banks were concerned. Apparently, the mere announcement of Libra’s proposition sent financial regulators into an tailspin. The unregulated issuance of “money” couldn’t be allowed to happen! Hence, Zuckerberg had to be seen being quizzed by pretty much the entire global financial and political “elite.” In May 2019, Thiel protégé Sam Altman wrote a blog post in which he said: Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner — let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency — and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency. I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. In August 2019, at the G7 central bankers symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the main topic of discussion was what the Bank of England’s then-Governor Mark Carney called a growing “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS” [International Monetary and Financial System]. Carney told the gathered bankers and financiers that the “world economy was being reordered.” He said that the US dollar remained “important” in the short term but that “the game” must change to suit a “multipolar world.” Therefore, “the global reserve currency”—the US dollar (USD) — needed to transform into some sort of “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” (SHC). Carney added: While the likelihood of a multipolar IMFS might seem distant at present, technological developments provide the potential for such a world to emerge. Such a platform would be based on the virtual rather than the physical. [. . .] Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency [the USD] from being displaced. [. . .] The most high-profile of these has been Libra—a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro, and sterling. [. . .] The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear [. . .] the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch. As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies. [. . .] Even if the initial variants of the idea prove wanting, the concept is intriguing. It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi. So, here is Carney saying that the Libra stablecoin raised the “intriguing” possibility of creating a new SHC “backed by reserve assets” but that Libra itself was “wanting” due to the lack of clear “terms of engagement.” However, if the requisite regulatory “terms of engagement” were “in force well in advance of any launch,” Carney raised the potential to create an SHC using Libra-like stablecoins. This, he proposed, could stave off challenges from new possible hegemonic reserve currency alternatives, such as China’s Renminbi, and create a USD SHC suitable for a “multipolar IMFS.” A month after Jackson Hole, in September 2019, Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss “future internet regulation.” He was also invited to the White House for a “surprise” meeting. Then, in October, Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the aforementioned Libra (Diem) and was invited again to the White House — this time for dinner and this time accompanied by then Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The Trump administration didn’t think it necessary to disclose what was discussed, according to an NBC News report. Immediately thereafter, Zuckerberg’s Libra project began to shift away from a stablecoin based on “a basket of currencies,” and by 2020 it was more closely aligned with the USD. The Financial Times reported in late November 2021 that Libra would initially launch as “a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar.” Webb and Goodwin speculate, with good reason, that the whole point of Facebook’s purportedly aggressive pursuit of Libra (Diem) was not so much about the stablecoin itself but rather about creating a threat that would appear to warrant regulatory change. It appears the team behind Libra always anticipated the failure of Libra and the resultant formation of a regulatory framework for a potential USD Synthetic Hegemonic Currency. Going back to July 2019, two months before the Jackson Hole symposium, Facebook stated in an SEC filing: Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. [. . .] These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency. [. . .] As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. The fact that Facebook (now Meta) knew Libra might fail and was counting on new regulations that would open new digital financial markets could cause careful observers to conclude that Zuckerberg’s Libra project was intended to be an embodiment of “creative destruction.” While the Libra (Diem) stablecoin didn’t make it, the stablecoin market as a whole has done quite well, if one measures by market capitalization. The leading stablecoins are Tether’s USDT ($140 billion), Circle’s USDC ($44 billion), and the Ethereum blockchain-based “decentralised” DAI ($3 billion). Then we have FD121 Ltd.’s FDUSD ($1.8 billion) and USDD ($750 million), initially issued on the TRON blockchain. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD, issued by the Paxos Trust Company and currently at $480 million market cap, stands apart because Paxos is a fully regulated US custodian. What’s more, PYUSD is perhaps the most firmly 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, backed as it is with a mix of USD deposits, short-term US Treasurys, and cash equivalents. When the Nixon administration closed the gold window in 1971, ending the monetary system formulated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the USD became fully disassociated from any real intrinsic value (gold), though fractional reserve banking had already practically relinquished the dollar-and-gold association. The subsequent fiat currency monetary system has led to an enormous expansion of the money supply and ballooning of global debt. Those inevitabilities ultimately caused what Carney described as the “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS.” Carney recognised that the world’s leading holders of US debt were Japan and China. Both countries have been accelerating the process of dumping US Treasury securities (government bonds). Their bond market moves further threaten the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Now Trump has come to the White House with a fiscal policy package promising low domestic taxes and higher international trade tariffs at the very time that his country’s “exorbitant privilege” — the US economic advantage gained by funding its own deficit by issuing the reserve currency every other nation needs to buy — is receding. US public spending is fuelled by borrowing — by issuing government bonds. The traditional monetary view would suggest that the only option available to the US is to massively inflate the money supply — again! But, with its staggering $36 trillion national debt, and with other national governments increasingly unwilling to buy that debt (creating a lower demand), US borrowing costs seem set to rise and exacerbate the mounting debt problem. Bluntly put, the US dollar and the US economy would appear to be screwed. Unless, of course, the US can find some other outlet to absorb its debt. If it can, there’s no reason why the monetary Ponzi scheme can’t carry on. Obviously, it will continue to have a terrible impact on people around the world, especially the poorest — including the poorest Americans. But when have rapacious oligarchs ever cared about social deprivation? The total supply of stablecoins has now eclipsed $200 billion. In the US, Tether is currently the third-largest buyer of US 3-month Treasuries and the 16th-largest purchaser of US government bonds globally. Because they absorb US debt, stablecoins are seen as the key to stabilising US interest rates. The proposed Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has led some to suggest that it might become a regulatory requirement for USD-denominated digital tokens (stablecoins) to back their coins with nothing but US Treasury bills. If so, under Paxos’ custody, PYUSD is already well-placed to take advantage. The bitcoin (BTC) hard cap, embedded in its code, ensures that no more that 21 million BTC can ever be “mined” (that is, issued). Every four years “halving” occurs, thereby theoretically reducing bitcoin issuance. This is the polar opposite of the fiat monetary system, in which the money supply can, realistically, only expand. The resulting inflation persistently devalues fiat currency. Bitcoin, however, is inherently deflationary. It is a tempting store of value for oligarchs who have treated the fiat currency system as if it were their own fiefdom to control and have run it into the ground. Currently the top 21 holders of bitcoin collectively possess 2.3 million BTC, representing around 11% of the total bitcoin supply. At today’s prices, that is the equivalent of $236 billion in BTC holdings. The presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, author (or authors) of the original bitcoin white paper and possessor of perhaps as much as 1.1 million BTC, is officially the 19th wealthiest individual on the planet, worth around $91 billion. He may not be an individual but a collection of bitcoin founders. Some believe the name was made up by intelligence officials who could be behind the creation of bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which provides business intelligence and mobile software services and whose leading shareholders are Capital Group, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock, is the second-largest holder of bitcoin after Nakamoto. The third largest are the combined governments of the US and the UK, which reportedly hold $19 billion and $6 billion of bitcoin, respectively. Block.one — backed by Thiel — is the fourth largest, with more than $15 billion. The fifth-largest holder is Tether, owner of the USDT stablecoin, which has $8 billion and is the world’s largest trader of cryptocurrency. Tether has committed to investing 15% of its annual profits in bitcoin. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, grilled last March by Yahoo Finance, called BTC “the most valuable asset in the world” and “the endgame for anybody that wants to own the greatest property in the 21st century.” And, according to a blurb last October by Forbes senior contributor Billy Bambrough, who has the magazine’s bitcoin and blockchain beat, “Saylor has revealed [MicroStrategy’s] endgame [. . .] to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.” MicroStrategy investors are presumably eager to see that bid succeed. They’re aware, as is Saylor, that being bullish on bitcoin further stimulates demand for BTC and brings “the endgame” closer. BlackRock apparently agrees. The multinational investment company has seen its global asset portfolio increase to approximately $11 trillion, thanks in no small measure to its pivot toward digital currencies. Hitherto cool on cryptocurrencies, as other large investment houses have been, BlackRock now considers bitcoin in particular to be a digital asset. “We believe,” said CEO Larry Fink last October, that “bitcoin is [an] asset class in itself, an alternative to other commodities like gold.” Also, BlackRock is now among those advocating digitizing the dollar. Trump’s executive order establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has tasked that group with developing “a Federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.” Simultaneously, the trajectory toward setting bitcoin as the “new gold alternative” is well underway. Notably, the Swiss government has already started the formal process of amending Article 99 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to allow the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold BTC reserves. “On-ramps” are payment services that allow users to exchange fiat currency for digital assets like stablecoins. “Off-ramp” services allow users to convert digital assets back into fiat currencies. Using stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the USD, greatly simplifies the process if you want dollars. That said, in a “multipolar IMFS,” Chinese and Japanese customers, for example, might not want USDs. Advances in decentralized finance technology (DeFi) are homogenizing global currencies. An effective SHC, with the USD set to dominate, is rapidly approaching. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates cross-border payment in USDC. This is fine if you want to off-ramp into fiat USDs, but if you want Euros, you still need to deal with the USD-Euro exchange rate (market price). This additional exchange reduces speed and increases the cost of the transaction (gas fees), thereby limiting scalability to non-USD customers. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, make use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi. This better enables cross-border transactions between stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies. Cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate communication and data-sharing between different blockchains. Combined with AMM advances, cross-border stablecoin transactions are consistently becoming faster and cheaper. Circle’s EURC is a Euro-backed stablecoin fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In 2024, researchers from Warwick Business School on-ramped in USD (USDC) and off-ramped in Euros (EURC) using Circle’s AMM. The researchers reported: Given that EURC is pegged to the Euro and USDC to the US dollar, trading in the EURC/USDC market should closely track developments in the traditional EUR/USD market. Indeed, we found that the blockchain market operates efficiently, with EURC/USDC prices staying within 20 basis points — or 0.2 percentage points — of traditional EUR/USD market prices. Furthermore, blockchain prices responded to macroeconomic information, such as interest rate announcements from the US Federal Reserve. The USD-backed stablecoins have primacy, and a USD-denominated SHC seems by far the most likely outcome. That said, some experts, such as former Binance.US CEO and 1Money founder Brian Shroder, predict a multicurrency stablecoin future. In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Shroder said, “We envision a global network powered by stablecoins representing all major currencies.” Equally, if interoperability protocols and AMM DeFi development continue to accelerate, such a multicurrency system is still likely to protect the USD. Those pushing USD dominance, such as the Thiel-led consortium behind the Global Dollar Network’s USDG stablecoin, with its proposed cross-chain interoperability, evidently have the edge. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) runs The Taskforce on Cross-border Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE Taskforce). The committee was formed in response to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments (established in 2020 with the final stage three report published in 2023 — hereafter referred to as the G20 Roadmap), which, the BIS notes, seeks to enhance “cross-border payments’ speed and transparency, while increasing access to cross-border payment services and reducing their costs.” The G20 — short for Group of 20 — is an international forum comprised of 19 member states (including the US, the UK, Russia, China, and India) plus the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU). Formed in 1999, it is structured as a multipolar global forum of five internal groups with the aim of coordinating economic policy. The finance ministers and central bank governors of the respective G20 member states and of the EU and AU dominate G20 deliberations. An important contributor to the G20-and-BIS-aligned CPMI-PIE taskforce is Coinbase, which was accelerated into existence by Y-Combinator (see Part 1). Coinbase responded to the recent PIE consultation by making the point that all the G20 Roadmap targets could be met by properly regulated stablecoins. Coinbase observed that “a mixed-payments ecosystem” that supports “traditional bank rails and wholesale payments” can benefit from stablecoin adoption. The global digital ID network is being created from a range of “interoperable” but “vendor-agnostic” digital ID products. There won’t be just one global digital ID card or biometric ID product—such as a single facial recognition system. Instead, all such products and systems will export data using an agreed-upon machine-readable format. In the case of digital ID products and systems, they will comply with ISO/IEC 19794 Series and ISO/IEC 19785 biometric data interchange formats. Thus, it is entirely possible that a single global database, perhaps the World Bank’s ID4D or some similar global solution, could collect data from all the interoperable vendor-agnostic digital ID products and systems worldwide. The ID4D project is supporting the introduction of global interoperability standards that will be “capable of facilitating transactions in the digital age.” The International Organization for Standardization, abbreviated as ISO (not IOS), has an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. This standard, called “ISO 20022,” is explained as: [. . .] a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions through structured, machine-readable messages. [. . .] ISO 20022 facilities interoperability and efficiency across payment systems, securities markets, and other financial domains. Its rich data fields and extensibility make it a cornerstone for modernizing global financial infrastructure. It goes without saying that the BIS — specifically its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — is eager to embrace the ISO’s “payments data harmonisation,” which it announced last month. As noted by CentralBank.com, “A key factor in achieving more efficient cross-border payments is the use of the same data standards by all countries, and the ISO 20022.” ISO 20022-compliant stablecoins and underlying blockchains are emerging, according to a December 2024 article in CryptoNews.com. This innovation is being propelled by the multipolar G20 Roadmap and raises the potential of establishing a global “unified ledger” — or “shared ledger” — that effectively oversees every digital financial transaction on earth. In 2024, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, recognizable by its acronym, SWIFT, reported: The concept of a new, universal shared ledger for digital payments and assets is gaining interest as a way of transforming how transactions are recorded and settled. [. . .] In its Annual Economic Report 2023, the BIS presented its blueprint for a future monetary system, envisaging a new type of financial market infrastructure—a “unified ledger”—which could “capture the full benefits of tokenisation.” [. . .] [T]he shared ledger model could potentially help to improve the cost, speed, predictability and accessibility of cross-border payments — thereby supporting the G20 roadmap. [. . .] [A]n ISO 20022-based messaging layer will enhance the shared ledger proposition. A Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is being constructed, but, like its global digital ID counterpart, it is very unlikely to be one stablecoin or one digital asset or token. Rather, as Coinbase developers put it, the SHC will be a “mixed-payments ecosystem.” The SHC is going to be an interoperable network of “vendor-agnostic” digital tokens. Stablecoins are accelerating the SHC’s development. Interoperability, enabled by machine-readable data harmonisation, will revolutionise business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The race is on to seize control of the “new world” of regulated stablecoins. Peter Thiel and his protégés, working in partnership with Musk and others, have established a global network of tech and tech-finance companies that have been key drivers in creating a “new world currency.” That we find ourselves where we are today is no accident. In 2023, Tether’s new CEO, Paolo Ardoino, was under investigation by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for potential sanction-busting financial activity. He submitted a letter to the committee in which he reported yet more evidence of the close relationship between leading players in the financial technology (FinTech) development community and the US defence-and-intelligence complex. Ardoino wrote: On December 1, 2023, we launched a wallet-freezing policy designed to significantly enhance the tools available for law enforcement agencies seeking to combat illicit use of stablecoins. [. . .] Tether recently onboarded the United States Secret Service into our platform and is in the process of doing the same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These strategic relationships reinforce our commitment to supporting law enforcement. [. . .] We have assisted in freezing, as of the date of this letter, approximately 326 wallets totaling approximately USDT 435 Million for the Department of Justice, US Secret Service, and FBI. [. . .] We look forward to maintaining a close working relationship with law enforcement, policymakers, and regulators in shaping a secure, compliant, and resilient future for digital currencies. During the Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates in early 2022, commercial banks and payment providers facilitated the Canadian government’s demand to freeze protesters’ financial assets and disable supporters’ ability to donate to fundraising campaigns for the truckers. Similarly, the UK government is currently forming legislation that would allow authorities to access citizens’ bank accounts and seize control of their finances — under the guise of combatting fraud. In both of these examples of the public-private abuse of claimed authority, two mechanisms were and are needed to enforce tyranny: agreement (that is, the banks and payment providers’ willingness to collaborate) and legislation (either existing or new). But in a world of solely digital money, neither policy debates nor the passing of legislation are strictly necessary. Total surveillance of our use of money and the ability to programme our spending is innate to the “new world currency” —USD SHC. From humanity’s perspective, no matter where we reside, the most alarming aspect of digital currencies — stablecoins, retail CBDC, or otherwise — is their surveillance capabilities and, in particular, their programmability feature. Trump’s new executive order on digital finance suggests that instead of elected officials programming our money, this task should be handed over to multistakeholder partnerships. To understand why programmability is a risk to all of us, consider the words of Bo Li, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China and the current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. In October 2022, Bo Li said: CBDC can allow government agencies and private sector players to program — to create smart contracts — to allow targeted policy functions. For example, welfare payments; for example, consumption coupons; for example, food stamps. By programming CBDC, [. . .] money can be precisely targeted [to] what kind of [things] people can own, and [the kinds of ways] this money can be utilised. Digital “money” can be programmed to automatically bar us from donating to the “wrong” cause or from transacting with certain “undesirable”individuals. Every transaction we make and all funds we receive will be recorded on the corresponding “ledger” (likely to be a blockchain) from which our financial activity will be monitored, analysed, and inspected. Such a system obviates the need for legislation to snoop into our bank accounts. China’s digital states — WeChat pay, and the similarly popular Alipay — are fully integrated with China’s e-CNY retail central bank digital currency (r-CBDC). China’s stakeholder capitalist approach to controlling its “customers” payments is not dissimilar to that currently being pursued in Ukraine—using its e-Hyrvnia r-CBDC—and a similar system is proposed by the Russian public-private state. The head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, told the news outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the battle against cybercrime and financial fraud meant that the Russian retail CBDC — the digital ruble — would allow accounts to be blocked, depending on “certain rules.” Payment restrictions could be applied, transactions inspected and control measures taken “if necessary,” he said. Also adopting the stakeholder capitalism model, Aksakov said Russia’s “major telecom operators, cybersecurity experts and key IT companies,” alongside the commercial banks, would partner with the Russian government to put together these “new measures.” Looking to the future, he suggested “joint ventures” could include the “American banks,” adding that “Visa or Mastercard” could assist with the rollout of the digital ruble control measures. Like Bo Li, Anatolov also emphasised the social engineering potential of the digital ruble: Payments in the digital ruble can be linked to smart contracts, where the transfer or remuneration to the contractor is regulated by a computer program, not a person. [. . .] We are now focusing on using the digital ruble to control the targeted spending of the [fiscal] budget. [. . .] Should we convert maternity capital or child benefit into the digital ruble and make it so that they cannot be spent on alcohol and cigarettes? In my opinion this is a justified measure and such restrictions are necessary. The US is evidently taking a different path towards its proposed digital state, preferring cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for programmability. But irrespective of whether your government and its partners opt for the retail CBDC or the approved stablecoin route, the outcome is a digital surveillance and control system. Stablecoins are certainly no less programmable than CBDCs. Global outsourcing digital employment agency Rise observed: The programmability of stablecoins through smart contracts opens avenues for innovations such as machine-to-machine payments in IoT applications. [. . .] The future of stablecoin payments is bright, with ongoing innovations and increasing adoption promising to transform how we conduct financial transactions. These technological innovations portend much more than simply transforming “how we conduct financial transactions.” In its totality, interoperable, AI-controlled digital technology threatens to change every aspect of our lives. If it does, we should not lose sight of the fact that AI is programmed by motivated human beings who hold ideological beliefs. The Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB); advances in machine-to-machine (M2M) payments — with AI algorithms automatically deducting digital money from our digital wallets absent any human interaction –– and an interconnected network of smart homes on smart grids paints a dystopian future few of us wish to contemplate. Unfortunately, the enabling gov-corp Technates are being built. The digital currency powered smart home concept has already arrived. This is achieved by linking IoT powered homes to digital wallets overseen by surveillance of the smart grid to which they are attached. Howard Lutnick’s—Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce — investment in Satellogic, via Endeavour, places him and his partners in prime position to capitalise on what the WEF calls the “trillion dollar opportunity” presented by the Earth Observation industry (EO). Orbiting satellite networks harvest data from digital devices and the subsequent AI analyses of the gathered EO data is set to revolutionise pretty much every industrial sector. Now in office, Lutnick can be confident in his assertion that Satellogic and its investors, including Tether, are “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” Just as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, are providing space for expansion of US debt, so to they are enabling accelerated investment in the development of the emerging “digital states.” Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, such as that being developed by Musk’s Neuralink, is bringing us closer to becoming “technoplastic beings.” It comes as no surprise that Peter Thiel is a Neuralink investor. Thiel also invests in Musk’s BCI competitors — Blackrock Neurotech is one. Again, Tether is also an investment partner of Blackrock Neurotech. There is evidently technological competition. On the one hand we have Musk’s Space X, Neuralink and X-pay, on the other we have Sattelogic, Blackrock Neurotech and Tether. But as we can see from Thiel’s investment strategy, it is the transhumanist and neurowarfare potential of BCI technology that excites technopopulist oligarchs. Competition stimulates development until the winning monopoly establishes itself. The programmable nature of the so-called “digital money,” combined with smart devices on smart grids, enabling precise monitoring of our energy use means that, de facto, “Energy Certificates” are being rolled out. Trump’s digital finance executive order does not nullify the threat posed by CBDCs. It simply diverts public attention away from the immense threat posed by programmable digital currency in general. Programmable, privately issued stablecoins are intended to avert the looming US debt crisis by absorbing US debt in cryptocurrencies. But the evident additional hope is that this tactic will give the US a head start in the race toward Technocracy. When Technocracy was designed in the 1930s, the scale of the surveillance and control system it proposed was soon discarded as unworkable. The idea of creating a bureaucracy capable of monitoring the energy use of every citizen and every business across a continent, using the technology of that day, was a fantastical proposition. Measuring a citizen’s or business’ energy usage via any kind of manageable monetary system, with expenditures controlled by linking the currency to identity, was simply not feasible. But today, not only is Technocracy finally technologically possible, the infrastructure for the rollout of Technocracy is ,as a result, being actively constructed. Technologically, such a dystopia is well within the realm of possibility. Do you imagine that the oligarchs behind the construction of the necessary infrastructure would never implement this digital panopticon? If so, perhaps it is time to ask yourself why they are building it. Is it simply because people like Elon Musk want us to live “lives of abundance”? To be clear: programmable money combined with digital ID is likely to enable oligarchs, via public-private partnership, to oversee “the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism”—that is, Technocracy. It will potentially give them total control of the distribution of “goods and services to the entire population.” In short, technological innovation has made a Technate eminently possible. The newly not-elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, is among the few, in the current crop of politicians, who is closely and directly connected to the globalist oligarchy. In a interview with Juno News, given shortly before he became prime minister, Mark Carney argued for the alleged benefits of said global oligarchy: I know how the world works, I know how to get things done, I’m connected. [. . .] People will charge me with being elitist or a globalist, to use that term, which is, well, that’s exactly, it happens to be exactly what we need. Carney’s proposed Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is intended to position the West in preparation for the emerging multipolar world order. It is obvious, therefore, that multipolarity poses no threat to globalist oligarchs. The so-called “global elite” have always been quite open about their ambitions, but Carney’s words suggest that they feel extra-emboldened at the moment. There is nothing new about their concept of a world split into more manageable “regions” or “poles,” but we do seem to be approaching the end of an inexorable path toward it. We do not have to take that path. It is not yet set in stone. Carney has openly told us that he and his globalist cronies have not haphazardly stumbled into his proposed SHC, nor have they randomly meandered into the clutches of a multipolar world order or its new IMFS. Conscious, deliberate decisions have been made, and specific steps have been taken, to bring about this state of affairs. There are people who insist that the push toward multipolarity is being led by the BRICS+ nations — in particular, the Russian and Chinese governments. President Putin and Paramount Leader Xi Jinping have been prominent advocates of multipolarity, for sure. Speaking in October 2024 in the lead-up to the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, Xi explained the multipolar vision. He said it is about fostering “inclusive economic globalization.” This can be done, he noted, by building “solidarity and cooperation” between countries. The BRICS (now BRICS+) project forms a bloc, or “pole,” of nation-states. It has already started to redesign globalism. As pointed out by former Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, who now chairs the New Development Bank (NDB) at the heart of the BRICS+ project, “measured by GDP, the BRICS countries have already surpassed the G7 in importance.” In truth, a multipolar world order has always been the penultimate destination prior to establishing full-blown, centralised global governance. The evidence supporting this conclusion is abundant. Renowned American historian, professor, and author Carroll Quigley meticulously catalogued the activities of the British/American oligarch network that was inspired by the imperial vision of the early-20th century Rhodes-Milner Group (also known as the Round Table Group). In a 1974 interview with Washington Post reporter Rudy Maxa, Quigley spoke about the “three-power world” that the network envisaged prior to WWII. The idea was that a transatlantic bloc and a united European bloc and an Eastern Soviet bloc would dominate a global “balance of power” structure. Following a 1956 Special Studies Project directed by Henry Kissinger at the request of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a 500-plus-page document titled Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports emerged (its copyright spans 1958–1961). The five reports in it aimed to define the problems and opportunities the US faced in the late 1950s, clarify national objectives, and develop a framework on which national policies could be based. The United Nations had already been established in 1945 (the UN headquarters was built on land donated by the Rockefellers), but, according to some of the panel report researchers, this international organisation hadn’t delivered on its goals. So, these researchers returned to the original prospect outlined by the Rhodes-Milner Group and suggested “a world divided into smaller units” [page 26] that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority” [page 26]: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] Fully developed, they imply a joint accord on monetary and exchange arrangements, a common discipline on fiscal matters, and a free movement of capital and labor. [. . . ] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. In October 1968, the Rockefellers supported the foundation of a globalist international policy think tank — the Club of Rome — to implement the “regional arrangements” that they had declared seven years earlier to be “no longer a matter of choice.” The 1973 third symposium of the WEF is considered by the WEF to have been an important moment in its history. At this event, Club of Rome co-founder Aurelio Peccei outlined the Club’s concept of the “sustainability of global economic growth” which, WEF delegates were told, required society to reconcile “economic development and environmental constraints.” Consequently, with this in mind, the WEF adopted “Klaus Schwab’s stakeholder concept.” In same year, September 1973, the Club of Rome wrote a confidential report titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System.” It proposed that the world be divided into ten “Kingdoms”—comparable to blocs, or poles. Though presented simply as an analytical computer model, the Club of Rome added a vision statement to its report: Our efforts in the immediate future will be concentrated on further use of the already developed [Kingdoms] model. [. . .] Implementation of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network [will be] for the purpose of joint assessment of the long-term global future by teams from the various regions [Kingdoms or “poles”]. Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order to assess with the model existing obstacles and the means whereby the [multi-Kingdom or multipolar] vision might become a reality. More recently, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab co-wrote, with Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset. One point they made in their book is that global supply chains are fragmenting due to global existential crises. They pinned the blame on a lack of cohesive global governance and offered a solution: The most likely outcome along the globalization–no globalization continuum lies in an in-between solution: regionalization. The success of the European Union as a free trade area or the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Asia (a proposed free trade agreement among the 10 countries that compose ASEAN) are important illustrative cases of how regionalization may well become a new watered-down version of globalization. [. . .] In short, deglobalization in the form of greater regionalization was already happening. COVID-19 will just accelerate this global divergence as North America, Europe and Asia focus increasingly on regional self-sufficiency rather than on the distant and intricate global supply chains that formerly epitomized the essence of globalization [page 79]. Shortly before the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave an interview to Megyn Kelly where he said: [. . .] it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. [. . .] That was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. [. . .] [F]oreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation with people who we wouldn’t invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn’t necessarily ever want to be led by. And so that’s a balance, but it’s the sort of pragmatic and mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. Casting the multipolar world order as a confrontation between great powers but also a “pragmatic and mature balance,” Rubio’s comments were congruent with the view of the globalist think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—which has consistently promoted multipolarity. The CFR believes the international rules-based order (the unipolar model) is “disintegrating at an accelerating pace.” CFR fellow Thomas E. Graham sees five potential regional poles in a multipolar global governance system consisting of the US, China, India, Russia, and Europe. The CFR line of thinking is that the US can contribute to multipolarity through foreign policy that seeks to constrain China as a great power; nurture India as a power, preserve Russian power and promote European power. Europe is considered the greatest challenge by the CFR because, despite its economic and possible military might, it “lacks political cohesion.” Therefore, in January 2025 the CFR argued for a new US foreign policy mindset “to encourage Europe to assume the responsibilities of a great power [. . .], one that has the hard power needed to deal with most security contingencies in its immediate neighborhood.” In March 2025, the Trump administration’s very public press conference spat with the visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was immediately followed by the US supposedly withholding military aid to Ukraine. This was met with seeming condemnation from the US’ European partners who responded by publicly announcing an €800 billion ($841.5 billion) “ReArm Europe” plan. This gives further impetus to the EU’s long-held desire for European military unification. It seems that Trump’s order not to supply US arms to Ukraine doesn’t apply to Thiel-backed enterprises like Anduril. While Trump was telling American and European voters that the US would not supply arms, Anduril was finalising a deal with the UK government to send their Altius 600m and Altius 700m attack drones to Ukraine. It is hard to say if the press conference between Trump (the former reality TV personality) and Zelenskyy (the former actor and TV comedian) was entirely staged or not. Obviously, both presidents were, at the very least, briefed prior to their quite extraordinary public row. What is not in doubt is that the trajectory of the global policy response is precisely as modelled and suggested by the think-tanks. Elon Musk’s ‘X’ social media platform is, at the time of writing, heavily promoting Trump as the global peace maker who just wants to stop the slaughter in Ukraine. Consequently, the public debate swirling across the entire western media and social media landscape is polarising opinion between those who want peace and those who argue this is short-sighted appeasement and Ukraine must keep fighting to stave off “Putin’s aggression.” Meanwhile, the globalist plans for a multipolar world order are surging ahead regardless of which of those two, pre-determined options is championed by the US or any other government. Political leaders, influential financiers, and representatives of policy think tanks across the West have evidently been planning for some time, even enthusiastically endorsing, construction of a regionalised multipolar world order. Their fundamentally globalist project is the latest iteration of the oligarchs’ persistent dream: global governance under their exclusive control. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is ostensibly a transatlantic forum where hi-ranking so-called “thought leaders” engage in a “marketplace of ideas.” The self-appointed glitterati discuss, plan and agree security and defence policy trajectories. The theme of MSC 2025 was “Multipolarization.” In the executive summary for the Munich Security Report 2025 we are told that “multipolarization is a fact.” Again, presenting us with the idea that things just happen organically: there is no design. We are given to understand that those who are positive about multipolarity see “opportunities for more inclusive global governance and greater constraints on Washington.” Whereas, those who are more pessimistic believe it “increases the risk of disorder.” The report notes the international enthusiasm for the United Nations 2024 Pact for the Future, replete with its Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Following the UN’s “quiet revolution,” the Pact is grounded in stakeholder capitalism’s public-private partnerships and “draws on the energy and expertise of governments, civil society and other key partners.” The UN Pact promises more public-private global censorship, centralised world economic and financial control partnerships (global taxation), and firmer mechanisms for global governance partnerships to seize control of nation states as deemed necessary. The MSC thought leaders conclude “for this cooperation [UN Pact] to materialize, the world could well use some ‘depolarization’.” The evident plan is for the global order to undergo a process of creative destruction to deterritorialize it in its current form and reterritorialize it as a more efficient multipolar global governance structure. To this end the MSC report notes: The next four years will show whether a more selectively engaged US fuels or contains global disorder. As other actors will (have to) step up to fill the gap, the multipolarization of the international system could accelerate. Despite US policy decisions supposedly being designed to confront and oppose China, again, as a result of the same US policy decisions, China has shown it is ready to “fill the gap.” In his MSC speech the head of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission — China’s foreign minister — H.E. Wang Yi said: [. . .] we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world. [. . .] China will surely be a factor of certainty in this multipolar system, and strive to be a steadfast constructive force in a changing world. [. . .] The U.N. is at the core of practicing multilateralism and advancing global governance. [. . .] We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N. J.D. Vance address to the MSC has been reported as harsh criticism of European censorship of its citizen’s and its media, especially with reference to the censorship of US commentators. Within his criticisms, Vance also advocated construction of a European “pole”: [. . .] the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. [. . .] [W]e think it’s an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. The extremely rapid response to the US foreign policy shift toward Ukraine has stimulated EU military unification and rearmament. This is entirely in keeping with the strategies and plans laid out by globalist policy think-tanks. Perhaps random events collide and every decision is nothing more than a reaction, but the weight of evidence thoroughly contradicts mere “coincidence theory.” We are supposed to believe that US isolationism is the pessimistic response to multipolarity while the more positive multilateral approach is closer aligned to the essence of the UN’s Pact for the Future. Either way, both pessimistic isolationism and positive multilateralism seem likely to accelerate multipolar global governance. Despite the different approaches, the geopolitical outcomes are seemingly indivisible. Both portend a regionalised world order bureaucracy and this has always been the planned administrative reorganisation of the planet prior to imposing firm global governance and, ultimately, global government. The Trump administration is blatantly declaring its isolationism. Trump, has publicly withdrawn from the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement, and the US pact with the OECD to work on a Global Tax Deal. He has imposed international trade tariffs and his toughening of US border security is apparently one of the primary reasons he was re-elected. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann has already said Trump’s posturing was interpreted as “concerns raised.” Cormann also said the OECD would “keep working with the U.S. and all countries at the table to support international cooperation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases.” Trump may be haggling for a stronger negotiating position, and we should certainly take his grand statements with a pinch of salt. That said, if we put all this together, what we see is a distinct narrative shift toward polarisation. It is important to stress that we’re witnessing a full-on propaganda offensive. Nevertheless, we are supposed to believe that there are real geopolitical tensions between the EU and the US, not just in relation to Ukraine, but in relation to Greenland. The European Council President António Costa said Denmark had the EU’s “full support” in the Danish government’s alleged confrontation with the US government. Trump has also made aggressive gestures toward BRICS+, warning that tariffs will rain down if the group dumps the USD. Meanwhile, one of he BRICS+ leading nations Russia has said that Trump’s “withdrawal” from the WHO risks “dangerous consequences.” Alexei Kurinney, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Health, said that “from the point of view of protecting exclusively the interests of the United States, this is an isolationist step.” In response to seeming US isolationism, the Chinese government has also criticised the US withdrawals from the WHO and from the Paris Agreement. As we’ve just highlighted, China has offered itself as a reliable global partner to these two entities. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: China is concerned about the US announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. [. . .] Climate change is a common challenge that all of humanity must face. [. . .] The role of the World Health Organization should only be strengthened, not weakened. The stage is clearly set for the final push toward the multipolar world order. But, strange as it may seem, this very push toward multipolarity is bringing the nations closer to a single global political, economic, and (perhaps most notably) financial and monetary “union.” In other words, multipolarity, as it is presented to us, appears to be a monumental psychological operation (psyop). There have been many attempts over the years to form a North American Union (NAU), which would be composed of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This geopolitical goal received a boost in 1994 with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the plan stalled after receiving strong resistance by the populace of all three countries. On and off, the US government has made numerous attempts to pry Greenland away from Denmark — more often than not citing US defence needs. Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Its inhabitants are therefore citizens of Denmark and, by extension, of the European Union. In 1951, the US and Danish governments signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty, which ostensibly appeased US national security concerns. The US maintains the Pituffik Space Base — formerly known as Thule Air Base — on the island of Greenland. Greenland has never been mentioned with respect to any proposed versions of either a North American Union or a free trade agreement. The prospect of building the Praxis gov-corp Technate on Greenland has evidently reignited enthusiasm. The original American technocrats, however, did include Greenland, along with Caribbean island states and Central American states — as far south as the northernmost territory of South America’s Columbia and Venezuela — in their proposed model of a North American Technate. Prior to this year’s inauguration, Trump outlined his dreams of establishing what can only be described as a plan almost geographically identical to Technocracy Inc.’s original North American Technate. In a series of off-the-wall-sounding statements — not unusual for him — Trump indicated that he wanted to add Greenland, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama to a NAU of Mexico, the US, and Canada. He even threatened the use of force, both economic and military, to construct a geopolitical map that is exactly mirrors the aforementioned North American Technate. There is no realistic prospect, in any geopolitical sense, of this imaginary North American Technate actually being formed. But, as we have already discussed, the Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy portend a kind of geopolitics more reminiscent of the system of city states ruled by the Venetian bankers. The Venetian city state was perhaps the most powerful seasteading project the world has ever known. Trumps seemingly weird ideas about seizing control of Gaza and Greenland, as if they can simply be acquired as sovereign states, and where the sovereignty of the people living there is considered “with derision,” is the epitome of the Dark Enlightenment thinking. Forced displacement of the “unthinking demos” is meaningless if you fervently believe “the system must be first.” The North American Technate map that Trump appeared to deliberately outline first appeared on the cover of the Technocracy Study Course. Yet even the original technocrats didn’t explain how all these nation-states would fall in line with their unhinged ideas. Ironically, the technological advances that have today made the prospect of a Technate feasible have also rendered the concept of a geographical Technate moot. By its nature, global communication technology globalises. The technocrats’ notion of a geographically bounded political Technate has largely been subsumed by the globalist oligarchs’ rollout of global governance architecture and technology. The Club of Rome’s Ten Kingdom model was precisely that: a model. While it is obvious there has been a global effort to make that model a functioning reality, it is clear that the gov-corp Technates under construction will first and foremost be economic and financial administrative zones rather than physical or geopolitical nations as we understand them. The technology used to construct each digital state is common to all. Gov-corp realms may be distinct, with, for example, Amazon dominating its sov-corp realm in the West and the Alibaba-Group dominating its sov-corp realm the East, but the “patchwork of realms” will be global. The decentralisation toward the digital city state is the network enabling centralised control. The formation of regionalised poles looks more like bureaucratic reorganisation in preparation for a simplified global governance administration of realms. Nonetheless, the symbology of Trump’s otherwise bizarre imperial statements seems relatively easy to interpret. Trump and/or his close advisers want to make it clear that Technocracy and the Dark enlightenment are the ideas driving the administration. I suspect Trump will say whatever he is told to say, within reason, on this subject or any other. In my opinion, posturing as a would-be emperor probably appeals to his ego. Personally, I doubt Trump even understands what a gov-corp Technate is, but he may. Whatever the case, the communicated signal could not be made more obvious: The neoreactionary technocrats are in control. Thiel and Musk are not the leading architects of the project to establish the global gov-corp Technate. But they are firm believers and, as made men, have been positioned to lead the US in that direction. Ultimately, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution renders the very concept of the nation-state superfluous. The technocrats and accelerationist neoreactionaries know this. Oligarchs have never had an affinity for one nation more than for any other. The system they seek ignores nation-states completely. If their plan succeeds, the only borders that will still have any relevance to them will be those delineating the “Kingdoms” or “poles” of a much-simplified multipolar global governance structure overseeing a network of realms. Once the mycelium-like global financial network is thriving and once seamless cross-border transactions are instantaneous — enabled by a digital SHC fit for a multipolar world — then geographical political borders will cease to have any economic or monetary meaning. As Peter Thiel observed in a 2001 PayPal all-hands meeting: The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related. The global system of gov-corp Technates that is emerging represents the most oppressive, totalitarian system of absolute behavioural control ever devised. There will be no need for government policy when entire populations — comprised of millions of individual human beings who were born to think for themselves — can be mentally hijacked and literally programmed by corporate behemoths. But of all the psyops foisted upon us, the greatest among them is the millennia-long propaganda campaign to make us believe we are powerless. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the “representative democracy” charade. Recognising the staggering audacity of the globalists’ plans and the enormous resources they presently have under their command is not to be “blackpilled.” On the contrary, it is the first step toward liberation. In order to resist the maniacs, we first have to understand what they’re doing and how and why they’re doing it. After that, the only hurdle we must surmount is that of putting all of our own solutions into effect. Our solutions do not have to reimagine the world, we just have to reimagine our tiny portion of it. You don’t need to worry about energy costs if you are energy self sufficient—or as close to it as you can be. You don’t need to be too preoccupied with food prices if you grow it yourself or barter goods and services with those that do, and you don’t need to be overly concerned with exchange rates if you choose your own medium of exchange and trade with other like-minded people in your own community. International financial institutions do not control “money.” Oligarch investors do not control technological development. Governments do not control populations. Only deception, coercion and the use of force ensures these false perceptions. Deception works by bombarding people with propaganda and psyops. Coercion and manipulation are designed to convince us to accept that which we can — and must — decisively reject. Force will almost certainly be used if we do, but there are also eight billion of us. There are better alternatives to top-down oligarch control. Despite the hopes of Musk and Thiel and their ilk, gov-corp Technates are not inevitable. We need only peaceably decline to obey their demented edicts, quit subscribing to their insane schemes, and build something better.

Yambo The Demented has directed the Pentagon to prepare plans for carrying out his threat to "take back" the Panama Canal, including by military force if needed, two U.S. officials familiar with the situation said Thursday. Via Common Dreams: According to the outlet, the officials said that U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is drawing up potential plans that run the gamut from working more closely with Panama's military to a less likely scenario in which U.S. troops invade the country and take the canal by force. They also said that SOUTHCOM commander Adm. Alvin Holsey has presented draft strategies to be reviewed by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is scheduled to visit Panama next month. The officials explained that the likelihood of a U.S invasion depended on the level of cooperation shown by the Panamanian military. Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out use of military force to seize control of the vital U.S.-built waterway, as well as Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. Last week during his joint address to Congress, Trump proclaimed that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal," but his administration has not clarified precisely what "reclaiming" entails. If his family wants to keep the grift going so badly, they don't want to put him in a nice memory care facility, maybe the cabinet members can do that 24th Amendment thingie? Maybe he sees a giant rabbit! After all, what Donnie Darko is proposing is a violation of international law! We know he can't read. Will Pete Hegseth act it out for him with toy boats? The Republican president says the U.S. needs to retake control of the Panama Canal to enhance "economic security," and has falsely claimed that the waterway is "operated by China." Earlier this month, the New York-based investment firm BlackRock led a group of investors in a $23 billion deal to purchase ports at both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, an agreement Trump dubiously seized upon as proof that "we've already started" reclaiming the conduit. Panamanian President José Raúl Molina countered that "the Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... The canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

Title: Panama holds 'firm' as US mulls military options for canal takeover
URL: https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2025/03/mil-250314-presstv07.htm

Iran Press TV Friday, 14 March 2025 5:50 AM Panama City has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining independence following reports that US President Donald Trump is considering measures to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. NBC reported on Thursday that the White House had asked the military to come up with options to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. The American television network said the White House had directed the US military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to fulfil Trump's desire of "reclaiming" the Panama Canal, according to two US officials familiar with the planning. In response, Panama's government emphasized on Thursday that it would remain "firm" in defending its sovereignty and the Panama Canal. "With respect to these statements, I have nothing more to say than that Panama remains firm in defending its territory, its canal, and its sovereignty," Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters. "Let it be clear, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and will remain so," he added. The Trump administration's goal is reportedly to increase the US military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal. Also, in his joint address to Congress last week, Trump insisted that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." Trump's remarks came after the US firm BlackRock and a consortium of investors announced a deal to buy two ports at either end of the canal from a Chinese firm. Already, the US military has reportedly more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out. The US formally took over control from the French of building the canal in 1904. After 10 years the US-controlled canal became operational. In 1999, the US relinquished control and the canal was formally handed over to Panama. The artificial 82-kilometer waterway connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean.

St. Patrick’s Day is right around the corner and it’s time to paint the town green. In every nook and cranny of Ireland, volunteer parade committees are getting ready to unleash marching bands, colourful clubs and bonkers floats on our streets, creating a riot of sound and colour to celebrate Lá Fhéile Pádraig. To find out what’s happening near you, click on our interactive map below. Over half a million people are expected to line the streets of Dublin for the National St Patrick’s Day Parade, which begins at noon. Over 4,000 people will be taking part in the spectacle, with Grand Marshal Victoria Smurfit leading the way. Fresh from their RTÉ Choice Music Prize win, Kabin Crew will act as Grand Marshal for the Cork city parade at 1 p.m., while trad music icon Sharon Shannon will be front and centre over in Galway. Over 30,000 people are expected to watch the parade in the City of the Tribes, which gets under way at 11.30 a.m. Local sporting heroes will lead quite a number of parades around the country, with Paralympic silver medallist Róisín Ní Ríain honoured to take on the role in the Treaty City at noon and three-time Olympian Thomas Barr acting as Grand Marshal in Waterford city at 1 p.m. Limerick St Patrick's Day parade 2024. Photo: Don Moloney None other than golf star Leona Maguire will lead the Ballyconnell parade in Cavan and FAI Cup champions Drogheda Utd will set the pace in their hometown while up the road in Dundalk, Collette O’Hagan – the first Irish female athlete to complete 1,000 marathons – will act as Grand Marshal. The variety of themes for this year’s parades will no doubt result in some fantastic surprises on the day, as creative minds turn their wild ideas into thrilling floats. Showbiz will be inspiring a number of events this year, with Wicked (Ballincollig), That’s Entertainment (Clane) and Movie Magic – The Oscars (Kilmallock) among the themes. People should Bee the Change in Tipperary town or show Whatever Floats your Boat in Cobh; meanwhile, up in Donegal, Ballyshannon will be celebrating the life and works of Rory Gallagher to coincide with his 30th anniversary. As always, plenty of places are offering a little something extra as part of their St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. In Doonbeg, a dog ‘pawrade’ will precede the traditional event, as will a leprechaun chase at Blackrock in Dublin, while a charity duck race will be held in Kilcock once all the marching is done. For those who want to go a little greener on this greenest of days, a pedal-powered parade will take place in Cavan’s Mountnugent, while the great wheelbarrow parade is pencilled in for Thomastown in Kilkenny. Those very impatient folk who simply can’t wait for St. Patrick’s Day to arrive might like to know that a maritime parade and fireworks will take place in Kinsale the night before, while on the day itself, the traditional Dingle Fife and Drum March takes place at 6 a.m. – more than six hours before the main parade. On the flipside, those who like their parades short and sweet also have options – Oram in Monaghan calls itself the shortest parade in the world, while Curragraigue in Wexford describes itself as the ‘smallest’ and ‘least well-known’. A whole weekend of festivities are being planned in a number of towns. Queen Maeve is the theme for the Sligo St. Patrick’s Festival, the highlights of which include performances by Sharon Shannon and Ruaille Buaille plus an attempt to break the world record for gathering the most leprechauns together. In Drogheda, there will be a carnival, market, leprechaun hunt and plenty of music throughout the weekend.

The St Patrick’s Festival Kilkenny has expanded to a four-day event this year and will feature live entertainment, American marching bands, a market, walking tours and a vintage fairground. Kilkenny Tradfest will also take place over the bank holiday weekend, ensuring music-lovers will be spoiled for choice in the Marble City. Four fun-filled days are on the cards in Waterford too, where the schedule is packed with musical performances, storytelling, craft workshops, exhibitions, a wobbly circus, drag lunch, comedy, walking tours, shamrock shenanigans and much more.

Title: There’s more to New Zealand wine than Marlborough sauvignon
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/drink/2025/03/15/john-wilson-theres-more-to-new-zealand-wine-than-marlborough-sauvignon/

We have an ongoing love affair with Marlborough sauvignon in this country. Those lifted aromas, bright fresh fruit and zingy lime acidity are a winning combination that draws us back time after time. It has been 50 years since the first grapevines were planted in Marlborough, and the region has expanded hugely in that period. So what is it that makes this wine so special? As every visitor is warned, New Zealand has high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that requires the application of sun block on a regular basis. This UV light allows grapes to ripen at lower temperatures, thereby retaining acidity, while the constant wind (“our secret weapon”, one winemaker told me) keeps temperatures down. In addition, the cool night-time temperatures and warm days allow the grapes to ripen slowly and evenly. Marlborough, named “Kei puta te Wairau” or “the place with the hole in the cloud” by the Māori has even less cloud cover and more sunshine than other parts of the country. However, similar conditions can also be found in other parts of New Zealand and with other grape varieties too. Waipara and Nelson, both a short drive from Marlborough, produce some great white wines, including sauvignon. But New Zealand grows a range of other white grapes (as well as some reds) including Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris and even Albariño. All of these share the same lively acidity and succulent ripe fruit that make them a great food-friendly alternative to sauvignon blanc. One of each grape variety is featured below. Lightly honeyed with succulent textured nectarines, orchard fruits and vibrant acidity. This would go nicely with Asian prawn dishes. From Lidl Enticing aromas, with crisp red and green apple fruits, lively citrus acidity, a honeyed touch and a lip-smacking dry finish.

March 14, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC: GRLT), a leading luxury real estate development firm, today announced its full-year financial results for 2024, marking a transformative year following the successful merger with Primior Inc. The company reported $2.67 million in total revenue, a 425% increase in EBITDA, a strengthened gross margin of 87%, and a major investment in real estate tokenization technology. With total assets reaching $29.37 million, Primior continues to expand its footprint in luxury real estate development and technology-driven investment strategies. Primior Holdings Inc. Reports Strong 2024 Performance: $2.67M Revenue and Pioneering Advances in Real Estate Tokenization “These results demonstrate Primior’s ability to scale operations while improving profitability and strategically investing in the future,” said Johnney Zhang, CEO of Primior Holdings Inc. “Our 425% EBITDA growth reflects strong operational execution, while our investment in Gaia, our asset tokenization platform, is setting the foundation for next-generation real estate investment. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value through expansion, innovation, and financial strength.” 2024 Financial Performance Highlights Balance Sheet Strength & Liquidity Gaia: Primior’s Strategic Investment in Asset Tokenization A key highlight of the year was Primior’s $750,000 investment in the research and development of Gaia, the company’s asset tokenization-as-a-service platform. Gaia aims to revolutionize real estate investing by enabling fractional ownership of assets via blockchain technology, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in property investment. We plan to continue investing a significant portion of our earnings into the development of Gaia, as we believe tokenization is the future of the market. As Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has stated, "Tokenization is the next generation of markets," and Primior intends to take a leadership position in driving this revolution with Gaia. This platform is poised to disrupt the financial market and fundamentally change how people own real estate in the future. Investor Outlook: Shares Poised for Higher Valuation With total assets of $29.37 million and 3.85 billion outstanding common shares, this equates to an approximate asset value of $0.0076 per share—a figure that reflects Primior’s strong real estate holdings but not yet its full growth potential. Additionally, earnings per share (EPS) of $0.00031 provide a baseline that does not fully account for anticipated revenue growth from new developments, Gaia’s launch, and ongoing operational efficiencies.

Title: Reports: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Requests Military Options for Unfettered Panama Canal Access

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked defense officials to “provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal,” according to reports. CNN reported that the request was outlined in a memo sent to senior leaders titled “Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance,” which replaces the 2022 National Defense Strategy and will guide the Department of Defense in line with President Donald Trump’s vision. NBC News reported that U.S. Southern Command presented draft strategies to Hegseth this week and that potential strategies include “simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it.” Other options reportedly under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks. Trump’s goal is to take control of the 50-mile canal and counter China’s growing influence over the area, out of concern China could shut down the canal to American shipping and the U.S. military in the event of a conflict. Banana declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China after Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino to reduce Chinese influence or face potential retaliation. Hegseth will reportedly visit Panama next month. Last week, Trump said, “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” As NBC News reported, BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90 percent stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion. An official told NBC News the U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, some of them Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats. CNN reported that Hegseth’s memo outlined the Trump administration’s priorities as securing the U.S. border, reinforcing the U.S.’s presence in the Western Hemisphere, and focusing on China. It also reportedly called for European allies to step up as “allies — not dependents,” called for providing military aid to Israel and continuing to arm Arabian Gulf partners, and called for greater military cooperation between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states.

Title: Trump’s Restructuring of the U.S. Empire – Tariffs, Eliminating USAID, Ending Ukraine War and more. Jack Rasmus

The policies animating sectors of the world, from the Democratic benches in Washington, to the Mainstream corporate media, to EU leaders throughout Europe, are shaking up the globe. They could lead to the end of NATO as we have known it. America gobbling up land masses in the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, and more. Dr. Jack Rasmus says that this is not an instance of Trump losing his mind. It is a determined decision to restructure the U.S. economy – the fourth in a series of other restructurings that took place since 1917-1918. The following is an excerpt of the entire discussion carried out between Dr. Rasmus and Michael Welch on the Global Research News Hour on Friday March 14. Dr. Jack Rasmus, Ph.D Political Economy, was a former teacher of economics at St. Mary’s College in California. He is the author and producer of the various nonfiction and fictional workers, including the books The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy From Reagan to Bush, Clarity Press, October 2019; Alexander Hamilton & The Origins of the Fed, Lexington books, March 2019; and Central Bankers at the End of Their Ropes: Monetary Policy and the Coming Depression. Jack is the host of the weekly radio show, Alternative Visions, on the Progressive Radio Network, and a journalist writing on economic, political and labor issues. His site is jackrasmus.com and his twitter handle is @drjackrasmus. Global Research: Greenland and the Panama Canal were threatened with annexation, possibly with military force by Trump. Is America turning back to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine imperial conquest, or are they making nightmare threats to get a less harsh goal? Jack Rasmus: No, the empire is consolidating, restructuring. You know, we’ve had these periodic restructurings of the American empire for over a century now. World War I was the first as the U.S., after it finished its first imperial foray offshore the continent with the Spanish-American War, 1898-1903. You know, that war was funded by taxing property owners, and it didn’t go over very well. And the U.S. imperialists knew that, you know, if they were going to participate in a conflict in Europe, which was imminent by 1912, that they would have to restructure. They could not participate in that, and nor could the U.S. empire, now beginning to economically move offshore, really play with the European empires if it did not have a position in terms of its currency and its military. So what happened in World War I was we created a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was really dominated and run by the New York banks. That’s why the New York Fed to this day handles all the international transactions and the currency issues, you see. It’s kind of like the central bank within the central bank. And we created a new fiscal system based upon the corporate income tax, which, by the way, taxed mostly the rich. The working class was not covered because they weren’t making enough money by the income tax in 1916-17. So we had a new fiscal monetary policy. And after World War I, of course, the U.S. dollar became the co-currency along with the British pound, and the U.S. stepped on to the global stage. Well, another restructuring occurred with World War II. And in that one, obviously, the dollar and the U.S. became the hegemonic economy and country in the world. The Brits and the French had to pretty much sign over their empires to the U.S. They kept vestiges of it and then lost that. And we had a new monetary policy and a new fiscal policy, a new industrial policy, and a new external policy. So every time you have a restructuring, it’s usually related to the empire either expanding its role, participating, or the third restructuring, which followed in the wake of the collapse economic crisis of the 1970s, economic and political. A third restructuring has been called neoliberalism, occurred late 70s, early 80s, and expanded in various ways throughout it. We had a new mix of fiscal, monetary, industrial, external policies that enabled the U.S. empire to expand once again. It was really a class-based policy, neoliberalism, and it was about taming its capitalist challengers, which were Japan and Europe at the time, and weakening its non-capitalist challenger, the Soviet Union. It proved to be successful. It also was successful in attacking working class and their unions in the U.S. and the social movements and so forth. So it was very successful imperial policy. That’s how you need to understand neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, I’ve always said, is kind of an obfuscating term. It’s really about imperialism and class-based politics. So that neoliberalism succeeded for several decades, but then the contradictions, as I argue in my new book, began to intensify in the 21st century. And since the 2008 crash, and then the 2020 crash, and in between slow growth, what we’ve had is an increasing inability of the neoliberal policies to deliver for the empire. And what we have today is the empire as it’s structured here in the neoliberal period is unaffordable. They’ve got to restructure it with the purpose of reducing the cost or moving the costs to areas of the empire that are considered more fundamental and more strategic. The U.S. has decided, at least this wing under Trump, has decided that the Ukraine war at $350 billion is a waste of money. The trillions of dollars thrown into the Middle East with the war against terrorism and certain countries hasn’t produced significant results. And NATO is a waste of money. NATO doesn’t need, we don’t need to keep providing a security umbrella to Europe. And that’s what Trump keeps saying. He says, pay your own way. I mean, you know, you’re rich enough. Why are we paying your way? Well, we’re paying their way so they can maintain these nice social program and benefits for their population because they don’t have to fund a defense. Now, of course, they’re trying to realize they have to do that now. And what we’re going to see in Europe is funding warfare at the expense of welfare. That’s coming. And even their media is talking about that, Financial Times and others. So that’s in progress right now. We can return to that topic. But what it means is that the U.S. is cutting its costs, you know, whether it’s NATO, whether it’s Ukraine, whether it’s the Middle East, whether it’s the 800 bases around the world, whether it’s USAID and NED and all the other wasted expenditures, which are part of the empire. And it’s looking back into the Western Hemisphere and saying, well, you know, we’ve got to shore up our strategic homeland here, which is North America, Western Hemisphere. And that’s how you got to understand Greenland and the Panama Canal. You see, this isn’t crazy Trump. This is very conscious policy. They know what they’re doing here. What they’re doing in Greenland is they’re trying to, America’s trying to develop an Arctic strategy. It’s way behind the curve with Russia’s Arctic strategy, which is well developed. The U.S. virtually has no Arctic strategy, even though it has Greenland at the western side of its Arctic. I mean, Alaska, it wants Greenland at the eastern side. Right. And then, of course, it’s got to somehow get the northern Canadian territories in shape here for that Arctic strategy, because as the Arctic clearly is, you know, the ice cap is disappearing, it’s opening up a transition, a pathway for Russia and especially China to Europe. That’s a strategic estuary or whatever you want to call it there on the western side of Greenland. So, the U.S. wants to consolidate that in Arctic strategy, control, basically prevent the flow of Chinese commercial shipping through that pathway there. And there are rare earths in Greenland that they want to exploit. Panama is similar. Panama is about checking China. You see, China has been buying up properties and deepening its influence within the Panamanian government. And the U.S. is no, no, no. And it’s already taken moves, put pressure on the Panamanian government, which has cut a number of projects, economic projects, with China as a result. Also, the Panama Canal needs to be enlarged significantly. And Panama doesn’t have the money and doesn’t want to do the enlargement. Why? Because the new Ford class U.S. aircraft carriers can’t make it through the canal as it exists. So, it’s strategic in that sense. And in the latest development, BlackRock recently just bought up the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal as the beginning of this. And the Panamanian government is backing down and talking about more U.S. control and influence of the canal itself. So, both the canal and Greenland are part of long-term strategic moves to check Russia and to check China. And that’s how it should be seen. And to talk about the 51st state of Canada is really to put pressure on Canada, I think, to really go along with the developing of a Northern Arctic strategy and also as a way of Trump raising funds through tariffs in order to also help fund the restructuring of the empire. You see, it’s not just saving foreign aid and foreign adventures and unnecessary expenditures abroad, but it’s also the tariffs, the primary objective. There’s two objectives of Trump’s tariffs. One is to politically browbeat allies and whomever for political objectives. Like in Mexico, it’s all about really the immigration and fentanyl flows and so forth. And it works. It works. Well, we saw the same thing with Panama. It works because Trump found in his first term, even though his trade strategy failed to check China, it did raise significant revenues. And Biden continued those revenues, by the way. And Trump sees revenues as a key way of reducing the debt and the budget deficit by raising revenues, but also as a way of moving the expenditure cuts, whether they’re in Europe or wherever, or whether you raise money, to move that money into new weapons investments. You see, the US is way behind China and even Russia in drone technology and in hypersonics and ballistic missiles and so forth, and AI and so forth. Well, it’s pretty much in a big competition with China for AI. But there’s a lot of crash weapons programs that need to be funded, and the empire structure cannot fund it now because it’s throwing away all hundreds of billions of dollars every year in places that aren’t strategic to US interests anymore. Ukraine is not strategic to US interests, and even conflict with Russia is not strategic Russia per se. The big challenge to the empire is the BRICS and the Global South, which is really the most serious challenge, I think, to the empire, certainly even more so than both Japan and Europe and Soviet Union during the 80s. The Global South in the 80s was a non-entity. It was undeveloped, and it was pretty much exposed to whatever pressures the US wanted to put on it, economic or political. Well, that’s not the case today. The Global South is industrialized. It’s a major player in the world now, and it’s the future major player. And the BRICS could undermine the dollar and the currency and international payment system and so forth. And I think the Trump wing of the capitalists realize that, and they’re trying to orient to the Global South. But to do that, they got to put this Ukraine nonsense to bed, you see. And then they got to pull financially out of Europe, which they’re going to do. And the Europeans, of course, see this, and they’re panicking, right? Because now they got to raise their own industry, their own weapons industry, which is virtually non-existent, especially next generation technology weapons like AI and so forth. Europe’s not even a game when it comes to AI. 90% of all the AI patents are filed by the US and China. So Europe is the backwater of technology right now. It’s the backwater of banking. Its industry development lags the US in a whole number of ways. The US is making Europe a dependency, an economic dependency, not just because of sanctions and blowing up the Nord Stream thing, which made them dependent on US gas and oil, but driving Russia out of the European economy altogether, in which American companies are flooding in the vacuum. But US policies that have to do with taxes, even under Biden, tax policies were passed that’s just sucking money capital out of Europe right now. And on top of that, we got the tariffs now, the tariff policies, right? And on top of that, you’ve got Europe saying, we’re going to remilitarize, we’re going to develop weapons, we’re going to spend $800 billion to develop a weapons industry, which is at the tip of the iceberg, by the way. Germany is going to spend $500 billion just on infrastructure, who knows how much more for weapons. So we have this massive weapon industrialization going on in Europe. But Europe can’t produce the weapons, at least for another five years. It takes that long to really develop these factories, plus they’re way behind in AI and will remain behind. So what’s all this about? Well, the US is going to pull out of Europe and the NATO bases and that wasted expenditure. But guess what? The Europeans are going to raise bonds and raise money. And where are they going to get the weapons in the meantime? From the US. But they’re going to pay full market price now, you see. That’s the difference. Well, it will make Europe even more dependent on the US economically. This whole war with Russia was really about debilitating the Russian economy and regime change. Well, that didn’t work at all. In fact, quite the opposite happened, but it weakened Europe. And I kind of think that was always the plan B of the United States with this war anyway, make Europe dependent on it, drive Russia out of Europe altogether, not just out of energy, right? And make Europe dependent on US industry and US banks. And that’s happening. That’s happening as we speak. So the US does not have to throw money at Europe anymore, does not want to. It needs to develop its own weapons industry even more. It needs to take care and consolidate the empire in the Western Hemisphere once more. And it needs to orient toward taking care of its lake called the Pacific Ocean, you see. So that’s what’s happening. It’s a restructuring a la 1980s economic restructuring, a la World War II, 1944, Bretton Woods, a la you know, 1917-18. The empire goes through these periodic restructurings. It changes the mix of its economic policies. It forges new political institutions, global. And that’s how you must see what’s going on. Now, the problem in the US is the whole capitalist class is not united around that particular vision. You still got the old guard, the Democrats and a huge bureaucracy that’s blown up after 50 years in the US of the empire neoliberalism, right? They’re fighting back. They don’t want to change anything. They wanted to keep everything the way it is. Well, you’ve got this domestic element of this restructuring, which is, well, we’re going to cut cost the government and we’re going to move it somewhere else. And the Democrats don’t want to do that. They want to keep the, I mean, they are totally blind and terribly led and have no alternative to what’s going on, except no change, keep it the same, keep it the same. And of course, the bureaucracy likes that because the bureaucracy has done quite well. It’s really expanded over the last 40, 50 years. So you got this alliance between the Democrats and the old bureaucracy, and you got Trump, which is more than just MAGA now. They’re all signed of a new coalition there, and they want to change things. And it’s going to be a protracted fight here for some time to come. GR: Jack Rasmus, in terms of this stage of restructuring, having to face new realities in the empire and so on and so forth, I have to also ask about restructuring for whom? I mean, when he was inaugurated, Donald Trump had 13 billionaires in his camp, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk is a major player in his team. I remember Michel Chossodovsky talking about how the COVID crisis was the excuse, he says, deliberately planned to engineer a broad economic depression, cancel millions of jobs, impoverish people with the lockdowns, and then appropriate and redistribute the wealth that remains among the wealthy. And according to a 2022 report by Oxfam International, while 263 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty that year, the world’s billionaires saw their collective wealth go up by $12.7 trillion. That’s about 42% what they had during the pandemic. Now, effectively, it’s like the 1929 stock market crash, right? Now, is this new restructuring of the U.S. economy actually being designed specifically for the status of the billionaire class in America in mind? I mean, make sure the Americans know who’s really in charge in this new restructured America, in other words. JR: Well, you know, they certainly benefit from all this, and their interest pushing it means even more money for them. So you can’t separate out the advantages and the benefits that flow to the very rich, the capitalists and the billionaires and the tech, you know, the new leading edge of capitalism. And they lever it, they take advantage of it. And, you know, that’s part of the deal to get it pushed through. You can’t separate out their interests and the whole restructuring because they’re the big beneficiaries of the whole thing. They make money when wars are started and they make money when wars are ended. And that’s what’s going on in Ukraine. You know, all this talk about minerals and everything. And the deal is really about how we’re going to, quote, redevelop what’s left of Ukraine and who’s going to really get that money. Well, it’s going to be the capitalists who get the money. Europe has its pot of money called the Russian assets, 300 billion, right? Well, the U.S. doesn’t have a pot to pay its capitalists to redevelop Ukraine. That’s what this 500 billion is about. Create a pot, right? Some of it will go to, you know, U.S. capitalists who are already deeply entrenched in Ukraine, by the way, and they’ll get that money just as the European capitalists will get some of the Russian money, right? That’s how they make money off of ending wars, just as they make money off of starting them. So I don’t think it’s a question of either war or what came first. You know, the capitalists saying, you know, Peter Thiel and all those guys saying, well, we want you to do this, Trump. It’s a very fluid thing where, you know, certain people for domestic reasons and for economic reasons and for foreign policy reasons sort of come together. Some of the many may not even know of this bigger picture, but, you know, conditions push them along in that direction. You know, as far as the COVID thing, yeah, they made a lot of money. The billionaires made a lot of money. That’s documented. That’s fact. Well, how did they make the money? Well, mostly they made it off of financial assets. Well, how did they get it off of financial assets? Well, the monetary policy was such that it gave them free money. You know, the Fed gave $4 trillion more to bankers and investors. They didn’t need it because this, you know, the COVID thing wasn’t like 2008 where you had the financial system collapse, where they threw $4 trillion to prevent the further collapse. No, no. The banks and the financial system was not in trouble in 2020, but they threw $4 trillion at them anyway. They took advantage of the crisis, you see, and stocks just blew right through the whole COVID thing in the last two years. Stock markets are up, what, 50 to 65 percent just in two years, last two years. So, yeah, these policies benefit, are always benefiting the very wealthy, especially the finance capitalists and the technology companies and the energy companies, these leading edge in the capitalist class. You know, your local real estate guys aren’t big players in all this, but the big capitalists always benefit from this. And yeah, they took advantage. I don’t know if they told Trump, you know, what to do here. You know, it’s kind of hard to make those connections, but you, it’s obvious you’ve got a huge smoking gun. The 2008-09 policies benefited them tremendously. The 2021 policies, in which, by the way, we spent $10 trillion. 2021, 6.7 trillion in fiscal stimulus, another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus, $10 trillion. And what did we get for the economy in the full two years that the economy was open, 22, 23, 24? We barely got 2% GDP growth. So, we threw $10 trillion at the economy to get an average, historical average, GDP growth, which means fiscal and monetary policy are broken in this country. That’s part of the contradictions you see of neoliberalism. They’re just not working anymore, but boy, are they funneling the wealth, both through monetary and fiscal policy, into the hands of the billionaires and all of them below them on the capitalist pyramid. GR: Would you care to comment on the selection of Mark Carney as the new leader of the Liberal Party and, you know, ultimately the new Prime Minister of Canada? I mean, he was a former Goldman Sachs banker and the governor of the Bank of Canada and the governor of Bank of England, and he reportedly directed the Canadian government on how to avoid the effects of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. On the tariffs from Donald Trump, Carney had said the following, I believe. He said that, well, he said he would go with the dollar-for-dollar tariffs and, in fact, aim it at them with the least impact on Canadians. So, do you think this is the best strategy for avoiding or diminishing the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs? JR: Well, I see Carney as put in place there by the finance capitalists, who are not just Canadian finance capitalists, but, you know, finance capitalism just sort of breaches country boundaries, right? They want a normal, quote, normal controlled change in the restructuring of the tariff and external policies. You know, Trudeau was just a big problem. Trudeau was just aggravating the hell out of Trump, and he was a big drag on trying to contain and control the whole process of the restructuring and tariff policy going on. Carney is a person who, you know, will work closely with his finance capitalist cousins in the US and Canada and elsewhere, and they will try to bring some rationale to the whole process of what’s going to happen with tariffs and other policies as well. So, you know, the capitalists see him as the right guy to sort of tame and control the whole process that’s going to happen. Trudeau was just going to aggravate it. He was going to maybe take it out of control, you know, and cause, you know, extreme tit for tat. We saw the same exchange, you know, with Ford and Trump, you know, Ford, the Ontario guy there, saying, oh, we’re going to put tariffs at 25% on your electricity. So Trump just, you know, bumps it up to 50%. You know, he sends a signal to him, you know, you better get this guy out of the picture, right? Let’s talk with Carney and, you know, there’ll be a settlement. There will be some increase in what Canadians are going to have to pay with the tariffs, but it will be controlled. It will be kept in a reasonable range. And that’s what I see Carney as the selection and what his role will be.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $84,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. BTC topped $85,000 for the first time in five days earlier in the day before retreating. "Some renewed macro stability is seeing Bitcoin and crypto recover in tandem other risk assets," Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at crypto advisory FRNT Financial, wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt. "Lower than expected inflation numbers, perception that geopolitical risk is easing, among other factors, are contributing to an easing of macro anxieties and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin." Savic noted that some Bitcoin bulls had "certainly used the opportunity to buy the dip...contributing to this recovery." Bitcoin's rise came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would vote for a Republican measure that would fund the government. A shutdown might have further unsettled markets already rocked by mounting evidence that the U.S. economy was headed for stagflation, in which growth slumps while prices rise. Risk-on assets of all stripes have been swooning for weeks as the country wrestles with the growing prospect of a trade war instigated by U.S. President Trump's tariffs on its biggest trading partners, controversial government cost-cutting measures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, the University of Michigan Sentiment Consumer Index, a measure of confidence in the economy, fell to its lowest level since 2022. The same survey showed expectations for inflation also increasing to their highest point in more than two years. BTC's rise returned the asset to over its 200-day average just a day after it had fallen below the widely watched measure for the first time in more than six months. The average is a favored indicator among investors to consider Bitcoin's longer-term prospects. Other major crypto assets were trading well into positive territory with Solana and Chainlink recently rising 9% and over 6% from Thursday, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Solana has been buffeted in recent weeks as meme coins which favor the blockchain have plummeted. Ethereum, which has also lost ground in recent weeks, rose more than 3.5%. Major equity indexes closed upward with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The S&P had dropped into correction territory the previous day, meaning it had dipped at least 10% from its previous high. Gold, a traditional risk-off asset, which spiked above $3,000 for the first time in its history on Thursday, sank below the threshold on Friday. In a text to Decrypt, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote that the Unversity of Michigan survey had likely pushed "investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge," and noted that BlackRock had resumed Bitcoin purchases with a $25 million investment, "reinforcing institutional confidence." But he warned of "volatility and possible significant corrections ahead."

This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. Will they do it this time? Meanwhile: What’s that in the sky? An IPO, a new ETF? Turns out it’s both. Real world wins for Coinbase Things keep falling into place for Coinbase. This week alone, the company saw a lawsuit against it in Vermont dropped and got approval to offer its services in India. Now, onlookers are watching to see if Coinbase will get the green light to offer tokenized securities. It’s something the company has wanted to do since before it went public in 2021. If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment. The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain? Currently, BlackRock has dominated the RWA space. Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries. In the past month alone, RWAs grew by 18% to $18.3 billion, according to rwa.xyz. RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account. But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe. Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. That’s about to change. https://t.co/WCUfDnu6SP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 10, 2025 This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.” And as of the end of 2024, cash generated from operations had ballooned to $2.5 billion. That means that revenue stream has more than doubled from $922 million in 2023. On Friday afternoon, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, closed at 183.12, up 3.17% on the day. Up, IPO and away! There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week). Last night, crypto exchange Gemini flew a Guinness World Record-breaking “aerial display of a cryptocurrency logo formed by multirotor/drones” in Austin, Texas. What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO? PROOF OF RECORD pic.twitter.com/0tno2sY1UN — Gemini (@Gemini) March 14, 2025 People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. That means Gemini is the first to make the jump from the rumored IPO list—which includes stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Bullish, Kraken, and Blockchain.com—into the actual race. If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column. Wen buy Bitcoin? It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy. The company, which recently changed its name from MicroStrategy and trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, has seen its Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24. At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin. Bettors, however, are optimistic the company will announce another buy over the weekend. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD believe Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, estimating a 76% chance that the firm’s holdings do not remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) On Friday afternoon, Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, closed at 297.49, up a whopping 13% today. Other keys Asset manager Rex Shares is nothing if not creative. On Friday, the company launched an ETF to bring Startegy’s Bitcoin-backed bond offering to the everyman. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.” Earlier in the week, Rex and Osprey Funds applied to offer an ETF that would track the price of MOVE, the Movement Network token that launched in November. It’s also the same firm that filed to offer ETFs linked to Official Trump (TRUMP), BONK, and Dogecoin. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Coming After SEC Lawsuit Ends, Predicts Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-coming-after-sec-lawsuit/
Time Published: 2025-03-14T19:30:49Z
Full Content:
Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has stoked fresh speculation around potential altcoin-focused ETFs for XRP and Solana by BlackRock. In a series of comments posted today on X, Geraci asserted his belief that the world’s largest asset manager will eventually add both crypto assets to its growing portfolio of exchange-traded funds. “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” Geraci wrote, adding that he believes, “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” He elaborated on BlackRock’s motivations, noting: “BlackRock is currently the leader by assets in both bitcoin & ether ETFs… I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s prediction marks a significant shift from BlackRock’s previously stated position on expanding its cryptocurrency ETF lineup. In July last year, Samara Cohen, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no plans to launch ETFs other than Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future. Several months later, in December, Jay Jacobs—BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs—clarified that the $10 trillion asset manager was primarily focused on its existing crypto offerings, indicating that altcoin-based ETFs were not on the company’s immediate roadmap. Despite BlackRock’s earlier reservations, industry analysts have highlighted growing demand for altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs), including those tracking Solana and XRP. In January, banking giant JPMorgan released projections in January suggesting that a green light for these ETPs could trigger inflows of up to $14 billion in their first year alone. According to the report, Solana-related ETPs could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in assets within 6 to 12 months, while XRP-based products could garner between $4 billion and $8 billion over the same timeframe—assuming a favorable regulatory environment. As of March 13, 2025, nine issuers have submitted their respective applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP-centric ETF products. These include Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, ProShares, Grayscale, CoinShares, Volatility Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Both ProShares and Volatility Shares have also proposed multiple variants—including short and leveraged ETFs—indicating a concerted push to provide a broad spectrum of trading strategies for investors. Central to Geraci’s prediction is the resolution of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The asset’s regulatory status has been under scrutiny, and many market observers believe that a definitive outcome would pave the way for major financial institutions—like BlackRock—to feel comfortable launching any new crypto-focused investment vehicles. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Print This week, BlackRock, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, signed an agreement with CK Hutchison Holdings to acquire 90% of Panama Ports Company, which operates the crucial Balboa and Cristobal ports. The acquisition comes amid U.S. concerns that the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison could create a strategic foothold for China in the Panama Canal. The deal also addresses some of the U.S.’s strategic anxieties for now, yet the implications extend beyond the Canal’s waters. The agreement holds critical weight in the broader context of U.S.-China competition across the Americas. Click here for the full story in Mandarin

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) – China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) reposted a commentary criticizing CK Hutchison‘s port deal with U.S. firm BlackRock as a betrayal of China, sending shares of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate sharply lower on Friday. The repost of the critical state media commentary by China’s governing body overseeing the territory highlights the complex geopolitical pressures the firm faces, as investors worry the deal could be derailed without Beijing’s backing. CK Hutchison said last week it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the waterway to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. On Thursday, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper based in Hong Kong published a commentary saying the deal “betrays and sells out the whole of Chinese people,” neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. The commentary, reposted on HKMAO’s website, said the U.S. would constrain China’s maritime trade and Chinese companies would face great risks in logistics and supply chains, impacting China’s Belt and Road initiatives. “This deal is an act of hegemony by the U.S., which uses its state power to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through despicable means such as coercion, pressure, and inducement,” the commentary wrote. “It is power politics packaged as a ‘business behavior’.” CK Hutchison and the HKMAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of CK Hutchison closed down 6.4%, underperforming a rise of 2.1% in the benchmark Heng Sang Index .HSI. A Hong Kong-founded and -listed firm owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison has said its business operations are independent from China. Hong Kong’s edge as an international financial center is expected to erode further as it gets squeezed by geopolitical tensions, executives and analysts said. Some shipping companies are moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry, Reuters reported. Trump, meanwhile, is planning an executive order to charge fees for China-linked vessels at U.S. ports, in a bid to resuscitate American shipbuilding and disrupt China’s supply chains. Vera Yuen, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong’s business school, said the commentary was a “manifestation of political risks and a cautionary lesson for companies that want to do business with both sides. “You cannot do both at the same time,” she said. This is not the first time billionaire Li has been in Beijing’s crosshairs. In 2015, Chinese media commentaries criticized him for abandoning China by extensively selling his assets at a time of economic tension in the country. While CK Hutchison agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement, the deal has not been finalized yet. “The risk of the deal has increased,” said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities. “CKH is now caught in the middle; if it doesn’t sell, it would continue to be bothered by the U.S.; but if it sells it would upset Beijing.” “We need to watch where this will lead CKH to now; if it would go through litigation to keep the Panama port, or they will need to communicate with Beijing.” (Reporting by Clare Jim and James Pomfret; Editing by Stephen Coates and Clarence Fernandez) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Stocks rebounded — after entering a correction yesterday — as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opted not to block a funding bill last night. That made it likely that the U.S. government won’t shut down this Saturday. Markets dipped briefly after consumer confidence weakened by ore than expected. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.7% as of 10:07 a.m. in New York, with the S&P 500 rising 1.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing about 360 points, or 0.9%. The Magnificent 7 stocks all rose in trading. Palantir (PLTR+1.84%) and Dell (DELL+3.17%) also advanced. The preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading for March fell to 57.9, lower than both the consensus estimate of 64.0 and the final February level of 64.7. Stocks in focus today: CK Hutchison’s (CKHUY+1.24%) ADRs fell 5.7%, following its Hong Kong-listed shares lower. China used state-controlled media to signal its displeasure with the conglomerate’s planned sale of its ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led (BLK+3.21%) consortium, the WSJ reported. Beijing has refrained from official comment on the transaction. Docusign (DOCU-0.87%) shares jumped 14% after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share beat expectations, even as its projections for future results fell short. Analysts pointed to signs of growth, Barron’s reported. Li Auto’s (LI+0.05%) ADRs climbed even after the Chinese maker of electric vehicles said its revenue will probably fall this quarter. Nvidia (NVDA-0.68%) shares jumped 3.4%. Hon Hai Precision Industry (HNHPF-4.01%) said it’s seen no slowdown in demand for servers it assembles for Nvidia and expects AI-related demand to double this quarter, Bloomberg reported. The company, also called Foxconn, expects total revenue to grow this year. Ulta (ULTA-0.49%) stock gained 7.7% after the cosmetics retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results — and despite its projection for the current period falling short of analysts’ projections.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices are struggling to regain momentum after a steep sell-off over the last month (not helped by a serious BlackRock chief executive warning). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has bounced around $80,000 per bitcoin after falling in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s executive order that called for the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve but fell short of market expectations and put bitcoin on the verge of a major price crash. Now, as China quietly primes the bitcoin price for a huge earthquake, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump’s top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve, with a White ... [+] House leak revealing he could be planning to buy huge swathes of bitcoin—something that would likely send the bitcoin price sharply higher. Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential working group on digital assets, told attendees of a closed-door round table hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute that the White House plans to buy as much bitcoin as it can, crypto news outlet Decrypt reported, citing multiple anonymous sources. A White House official confirmed Hines’ comments to Decrypt, adding any such acquisitions would be made "in a budget neutral way that doesn’t cost the taxpayers a dime." The private meeting was reportedly attended by U.S. senators Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), and Bernie Moreno (R-OH) as well as Strategy founder Michael Saylor, bitcoin miner Marathon Digital chief executive Fred Thiel, Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley, and the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc David Bailey. Lummis this week reintroduced legislation that would see the U.S. buy up to one million bitcoin over five years, enshrining into law the strategic bitcoin reserve created by Trump via executive order earlier this month. Trump’s executive order creating the bitcoin reserve was met with a bitcoin price sell-off due to its lack of commitment to buying additional bitcoin. This U.S. currently holds around 200,000 bitcoin, accumulated via civil and criminal forfeitures. However, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and its broader crypto stockpile of other digital assets. “Disappointment over the U.S. government’s strategic bitcoin reserve, formed from seized assets rather than immediate additional purchases, has also weighed on sentiment,” Tagus Capital analysts wrote in an emailed note. “However, concerns over the strategic bitcoin reserve may be overdone, with the potential for budget-neutral future purchases by the U.S. government and an acceleration of other nations adopting bitcoin as strategic reserves.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back from its all-time high, reached in the aftermath of Donald Trump's ... [+] November election victory. Despite the bitcoin price plummeting in recent weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers have been talking up recent developments in the U.S. and abroad, predicting the dip is temporary. “Despite considerable market headwinds, the crypto industry has witnessed several groundbreaking developments, namely: the establishment of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve; the establishment of a U.S. digital asset stockpile; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s authorization for banks to engage in crypto assets; the recognition of stablecoins and real-world assets; and here in Europe the introduction of the E.U.’s MiCA regulations,” Brett Reeves, head of European sales at crypto infrastructure provider BitGo, said in emailed comments. "These advancements, which seemed aspirational merely a year ago, reflect a rapidly evolving landscape where digital assets are becoming integral to the global financial system. So whilst prices may be crashing for now, we must remember how far we've come in a short space in time and just how much potential this space has in the years ahead."

Editor Activism Activist Post, Neenah Payne From 2020-2023, the US government and corporate media told Americans to “Follow the science”. They assured us that the unprecedented COVID policies were based on a “scientific consensus”. Anyone – even top doctors and scientists — who questioned those policies was ridiculed as a “conspiracy theorist” and “anti-vaxxer”. However, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya Confirmed As NIH Director shows how destructive and unscientific those rushed policies were. Yet, the government and corporate media continue to ignore the devastating consequences – the astronomical deaths and injuries – caused by those policies. Now, the documentary Follow The Silenced tells the story of those injured by the COVID shots. Experience Follow the Silenced, a groundbreaking documentary that goes beyond personal stories to expose the deeper systemic challenges faced by the injured.

Anyone who refused to get the shots was ridiculed as a “selfish anti-vaxxer” who was “killing grandma”. Rachel Maddow said people who got the shots could not pass COVID to anyone else. However, the tide has turned now. Viewers demand apology from MSNBC, Rachel Maddow for previous COVID vaccine comments. Why War On Unvaccinated Is So Dangerous For Everyone Don Lemon ridiculed people who didn’t get the shots. Don Lemon argues it’s time to ‘shun’ anti-vaxxersCNN’s Don Lemon On The Unvaccinated: ‘Their Behavior Is Idiotic And Nonsensical’ King of Clowns Don Lemon says unvaxxed people should be banned from going to buy food “CNN talking head Don Lemon says we “shouldn’t waste our breath” on unvaccinated people, so instead of talking to them as rational human beings with dignity and personal freedom, we should ban anyone who hasn’t gotten the ‘Rona vaccine from the grocery store (and employment). I’m sure a lot of people are not gonna agree with this, but [you] don’t get the vaccine, you can’t go to the supermarket. You don’t have the vaccine? You can’t go to the ball game. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t go to work. Don’t have the vaccine? Can’t come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service.” Ah, yes. An emergency authorized vaccine for a virus that is insanely survivable for healthy people is the exact same as the moral argument against walking in butt naked to a store. It’s also okay that half of America starves based on this premise.” If Lemon’s comments had been said about ANY other group, they would be banned as hate speech and incitement to violence. CNN’s Don Lemon has lowest-rated week since struggling program switched names shows that Lemon is struggling to maintain an audience. So, these comments may have been an attempt to get publicity. Government and Corporate Media Continue To Ignore Evidence The government and corporate media have continued to ignore and deny the evidence that the COVID shots caused massive deaths and serious injuries. LONG COVID OR VACCINE INJURY? SPIKE PROTEIN FOUND IN THE VACCINATED 2 YEARS LATERWith the NIH showing little concern to study long COVID despite pouring $1 billion into research, a new bombshell study on patients with a debilitating post-vaccination syndrome is showing elevated spike protein levels over 2 years (the time of study) after vaccination. FOLLOW THE SILENCED: EXPOSING THE COVER-UP OF COVID-19 VACCINE INJURIES COVID Shots Are Killing Large Numbers of People World Renowned Conventional Doc Blasts The COVID JAB-Erwocks links to an interview with Dr. Peter McCullough, Vice Chief of Internal Medicine, Baylor University Medical Center. The article says Dr. McCullough “might be the world’s top cardiologist, who also holds an MPH degree and is a professor of medicine. His work/background is totally stunning, and seems impossible for one person. …Even better, he’s also world famous. Meaning…he has the exceptional intelligence to analyze and dissect the COVID VAX atrocity. The measured way in which he delivers this bombshell is also remarkable.” Dr. McCullough discusses the blood clots for which the J&J product was halted and points out that the blood clots caused by the mRNA vaccine are “probably 30 times that” — but it has not been halted. Dr. McCullough says “…keep in mind that the NIH is a co-owner of the Moderna patent.” Excess Mortality Just Got Worse: Alarming New Data! Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that when former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd discussed shocking information about excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history,” Dowd stated. Dowd noted an acceleration of excess mortality in 2021, around the time when mandates and boosters took effect. Dowd said “starting in the summer and into the Fall, with the mandates and the boosters, there were 61,000 excess millennial deaths. Basically, millennials experienced a Vietnam War in the second half of 2021.” National Archives stated 58,220 U.S. military fatal casualties of the Vietnam War. Dowd says this data is the smoking gun which shows COVID-19 injections are causing excess mortality in all age groups. Dowd labeled this ‘democide.’ Wikipedia’s definition of democide: “Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder”. Dowd summarized: “So the government, through the mandates, has killed people.” TFH #603: 9/11 And The Deagel Report With Charlie Robinson reported that Dr. Bill Deagle predicted in 2017 that the populations in Western countries would drop by 2025 because of a pandemic and an economic crisis. Robinson correlated those predictions with the “excess deaths” in 2021-2022 in Western countries that took the COVID shots. He pointed out that countries that did not get many COVID shots are ones for which Deagle predicted population rises. So, Dr. Deagle knew by 2017 there was a plan to release a deadly “pandemic” to kill much of the Western population by 2025. Charlie Robinson, host of MagroAggressions explains in the video below that the deaths predicted years ago by Dr. Bill Deagle correspond to the deaths of countries that got the most COVID shots. Robinson is the author of Hypocrazy: Surviving In A World Of Cultural Double Standards (2021) and The Octopus of Global Control in 2017. He is co-author of The Controlled Demolition of the American Empire.Part 1: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie RobinsonA scary look at what the future may hold as the jabbed continue to die.Part 2: Where did all the people go? From Macroaggressions with Charlie Robinson First published on 5/13/22 The COVID shots were not necessary. The CDC stats showed in early 2020 that COVID was little threat toa anyone unless they were old and/or had several serious illnesses. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (1984-20220 published an article on 3/26/20 in the New England Journal of Medicine called Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted. It was co-authored by Dr. H. Clifford Lane, M.D., NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects and by Dr. Robert Redfield of the CDC. The article said “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a fatality rate of approximately 0.1)…rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively”. However, when Dr. Fauci served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, he endorsed COVID shots for pregnant women and babies as young as six months old. Yet, several inexpensive outpatient treatments for COVID were known in early 2020 — including HCQ, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Ivermectin, and Budesonide. The Emergency Use Authorizations for the COVID shots illegal because EUAs can be issued only if no treatments are available. Dr. Fauci declared “I represent science”. So, anyone who questioned the COVID “consensus” was questioning “science”. Fauci under fire: Declares “I represent science” 11/20/21 With his Sunday retort “What happened on January 6th, Senator?” it appears to critics that Dr. Anthony Fauci has openly expressed what many of them suspected – that he is a partisan political player. Fauci’s comment was made in response to Republican Senator Ted Cruz’s tweet that Fauci should face prosecution for denying under oath that the U.S. helped fund gain of function research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. However, during the Congressional hearing on 6/4/22, Dr. Fauci admitted there was no scientific basis for many COVID policies – including wearing masks and social distancing which was used to justify the devastating lockdowns. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Hearing Reveals Dr. Fauci Made Mitigation Decisions Without Factual Evidence Fauci says no evidence for pandemic guidance on masking or social distancing. The New York Times Magazine: Dr. Fauci Looks Back” ‘Something Clearly Went Wrong’ shows that Fauci admits there were serious problems with the COVID policies he forced on the nation. President Joe Biden pardoned Fauci. President Biden pre-emptively pardoned Fauci back to 2014 when he reportedly authorized illegal gain of function research. However, that may not protect him as state Attorney Generals are now planning to sue Dr. Fauci. The fact that he has been pardoned means that he can no longer invoke The Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer. Attorney General Alan Wilson leads coalition of AGs investigating Dr. Anthony Fauci’s COVID-19 response South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson is leading a coalition of state attorneys general in an investigation into Dr. Anthony Fauci’s role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, demanding accountability for alleged mismanagement, misleading statements, and suppression of scientific debate.

Title: Here Is When Wall Street Giant BlackRock Will Join Spot XRP ETF Race, According To Pundit

Under the new Donald Trump administration, crypto-friendly policies have fueled a surge in ETF filings beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Earlier this week, Franklin Templeton became the largest asset manager to seek approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the price of XRP, the fourth-largest crypto by market cap. Despite multiple issuers filing with the SEC to launch spot XRP funds, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and Bitcoin and Ether ETF issuer, has avoided the Ripple-promoted token. Notably, BlackRock’s spot BTC and ETH ETFs have both experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust ETF, IBIT, eventually matured enough to surpass its gold ETF in assets under management. ETF Store president Nate Geraci believes the asset management behemoth will only file for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) once the SEC’s four-year-long lawsuit against Ripple is concluded. The prolonged battle since December 2020 over allegations of unregistered XRP sales may be over soon. The July 2023 ruling by District Judge Analisa Torres of the Southern District of New York, declaring XRP a non-security when sold to retail investors, but fining Ripple $125 million for institutional sales marked a turning point. Recent reports indicate the legal spat between the two parties could soon reach a conclusion, with Ripple negotiating better terms as the regulator adopts a more lenient regulatory stance under acting Chair Mark Uyeda. One final issue reportedly being discussed is a comparison between XRP and Ether. At the core is whether XRP continues to trade and have a utility that makes it more of a commodity than a security. Geraci has also predicted that BlackRock’s Solana ETF could be filed with the SEC any day from now. He doesn’t think the $10 trillion asset manager will simply allow rivals to introduce ETFs baked on the XRP and SOL “without any sort of fight.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas has previously penciled in a 65% and 70% chance that XRP ETFs and SOL ETFs, respectively, secure a green light this year. However, he did not forecast the timing. Issuers must still contend with regulatory review, lawsuits, and public comment on the pending applications.

Title: BlackRock, other investors to pump another $15 million into debt-ridden Razor Group

Investors including BlackRock Inc. have agreed to provide another loan of at least $15 million to Razor Group, according to people familiar with the matter, as the German e-commerce brand aggregator attempts to stave off a liquidity crunch. The relatively modest financing proposal indicates the severity of the cash squeeze at the Berlin-based firm that, according to Pitchbook data, has raised more than $1.3 billion in capital. It’s part of a turnaround effort that includes talks between Razor and fellow aggregator Infinite Commerce Inc. for a potential merger, the people said, asking not to identified because the process is confidential. A total of $30 million in bridge financing has been granted to Razor over recent months by lenders such as Victory Park Capital Advisors as well as equity investors including Christian Angermayer’s Presight Capital, the people added. The company is also working on a potential fundraising with existing shareholders, according to emails sent to investors in late February and seen by Bloomberg News. Communications show that Razor investors were contemplating a financing of at least $75 million alongside the M&A deal. Spokespeople for Razor, BlackRock and Presight Capital declined to comment on the proposed turnaround. Spokespeople for Victory Park and Infinite Commerce didn’t respond to requests for comment. So-called Amazon aggregators buy up firms that sell products via online platforms, with the aim of saving costs on logistics and marketing by bundling brands under one roof. The boom in e-commerce during the pandemic encouraged investors to bet billions on these businesses, but falling consumer demand since the end of lockdown has seen a wave of restructuring across the sector — to the detriment of their investors. One of their main strategies for plugging holes in these aggregators’ balance sheets has been masterminding consolidation between the e-commerce conglomerates themselves. Infinite Commerce, the potential merger partner, is itself a combination of four brand aggregators that were merged with the help of Victory Park last year. Razor Group also acquired Perch — another BlackRock investment in the aggregator sector — last year. BlackRock and Victory Park joined Razor’s roster of lenders in May 2021, according to a statement at the time. However, the investment has since soured with a BlackRock middle-market private credit fund downgraded to junk last week, in part due to “credit challenges” stemming from brand aggregators. That included a $50.3 million unrealized loss on Razor as of Dec. 31. The publicly traded fund, BlackRock TCP Capital Corp., will “avoid meaningful concentrations in any one industry subsector, such as Amazon aggregators,” Chief Executive Officer Phil Tseng said on a Feb. 27 earnings call. The industry consolidation is fraught with tension between equity holders — who don’t want to take complete losses on their investments — and creditors, who are usually first to be paid in a liquidation but know they’ll only get pennies on the dollar. The hope is that with further acquisitions, Razor can aim for an initial public offering and offer something in return for all investors. Razor ran into issues with inventory, according to the emails from late last month. A delay in closing the purchase of Perch as well as liquidity constraints led to a pause in new orders, leading to periods when products were out of stock. Supply-chain issues also contributed to difficulties replenishing stock later, the messages show. This pressure on earnings eventually led Razor to breach the debt terms of a working capital facility, which then prompted Razor’s other lenders to allege a default on their own financing, according to the emails. This paved the way for discussions over a consensual solution, they show. BlackRock also was involved in the restructuring of SellerX, another German brand aggregator, and agreed to take a stake in the company as part of a debt-for-equity swap, Bloomberg previously reported. Another of its brand aggregator investments, Thrasio, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: China has sharply criticized a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to American asset management giant BlackRock, attacking the deal as “spineless groveling” and a “betrayal” of the Chinese people. A commentary published by the state-owned Ta Kung Pao newspaper and reposted on the website of China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office on Thursday sent shares in CK Hutchison (CKH), the Hong Kong-based owner of the ports, plummeting by more than 6% on Friday. Observers say it was a sign that some investors are concerned the deal may not ultimately go through, if Beijing objects. “I’m not aware that any approval from Chinese regulators is required given CKH is retaining all of its existing Chinese ports,” Dan Baker, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar, told CNN. “Of course, there is some chance that other influences may be brought to bear on the company that might put the deal at risk. The market seems to be pricing in some chance of this.” CNN has reached out to the conglomerate for comment. Last week, a group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from CK Hutchison. The consortium also agreed to buy CK Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. They said the deal is an “agreement in principle.” US President Donald Trump said during the lead-up to his inauguration and since taking office that he intended to “take back” the Panama Canal from Panama, which took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. He cited Chinese ownership of some of the port operations as a sign that China was now running the canal. When announced last week, the deal was seen as an expedient way for CK Hutchison — a global conglomerate backed by Li Ka-shing, long famed for being one of Hong Kong’s savviest investors — to get rid of a political hot potato while fetching a good price from BlackRock and company. The group said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it expected to receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale, an amount well above what analysts estimated the ports were worth. But Thursday’s scathing commentary from a newspaper closely aligned with the ruling Communist Party could throw a spanner in the works. It called out CK Hutchison, accusing it of “spineless groveling,” “profit-seeking” and “disregarding national interests and national justice, and betraying and selling out all Chinese people.” “Faced with such a major event and a matter of great justice, the relevant company should think twice … and think carefully about what position and side it should stand on,” it added. The Panama Canal was constructed by the US in the early years of the 20th century and completed in 1914. For most of that century, it was operated by the US, before the Carter Administration negotiated its handover to Panama in a controversial treaty opposed by many Republicans at the time. The 51-mile canal is key to both the movement of international trade and US military vessels. About 4% of the world’s maritime trade and more than 40% of US container traffic traverses the canal. Since its handover in 1999, the canal itself has been operated by Panama, not the Chinese, despite Trump’s stated concerns. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Why CEOs are calm about tariffs in public — but 'very discouraged' in private

By Maria Aspan President Trump arrives at the Business Roundtable's quarterly meeting on March 11, to address a group of CEOs amid an ongoing market selloff sparked by his new tariffs. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Getty Images North America hide caption Wall Street is panic-selling over President Trump's chaotic new tariffs. Business executives are reportedly making frantic calls to the White House. And on Tuesday, the country's top CEOs crowded into a closed-door meeting with Trump — setting a record for attendance. Yet in public, corporate America's leaders are remaining calm — and even upbeat. "The business community understands what the president is trying to do with tariffs," Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told Fox Business Network on Wednesday. Solomon acknowledged that companies "always" want lower tariffs. But he was also careful to start his comments by praising Trump for being "engaged with the business community" — unlike, he added, the Biden administration. The Goldman Sachs CEO was speaking a day after Trump met with him and other members of the Business Roundtable, an influential CEO group. The meeting followed two days of sharp losses in the U.S. stock market, in a $4 trillion (and ongoing) selloff, largely kindled by Trump's words and actions: Since early March, Trump has implemented a flurry of steep new tariffs, reversed some of them, and shrugged off concerns over their economic impact. When asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump demurred — in a reply that sparked this week's market turmoil. "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America," the president told Fox News in an interview that aired Sunday. By mid-week, a handful of the most powerful CEOs had started to express concern — but even then, only in very mild terms. "Uncertainty is not a good thing," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who runs the country's largest bank, said Wednesday at a conference hosted by the publication Semafor. And Larry Fink, who runs investment giant BlackRock, told CNN that "the economy is weakening as we speak." Yet Fink was also quick to add that the Trump administration's policies "can be very productive for the United States" in the long run. A White House spokesperson on Thursday reiterated his statement to NPR from earlier this week. "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," White House spokesperson Kush Desai said by email. Corporate America's careful rhetoric — even as many big companies brace for the impact of the market volatility and the tariffs — illustrates the delicate diplomacy that business leaders are trying to engage in. They largely welcome Trump's other economic promises — including lower taxes and fewer regulations. Business leaders also see limited benefits to criticizing the president in public, experts say. That's a marked contrast from Trump's first term, when some CEOs publicly resigned from White House advisory councils to protest the president's handling of racist violence in Charlottesville, Va. But eight years later, corporate America is much less willing to wade into public conversations about politics — or "social" issues that companies don't see as directly related to their bottom lines. Today, they're more focused on the potential financial upsides of Trump's new term. The president actively courted business interests during his campaign — and at first, corporate America seemed thrilled with the results of the election. CEO confidence soared to a three-year high last month, according to the Conference Board's quarterly survey of the CEOs of the largest companies. Now Trump's stop-and-start tariff policies seem to be complicating many companies' economic outlook. But business leaders are trying to avoid adding to investors' financial panic, according to Anna Tavis, who chairs New York University's department of human-capital management and talks to executives across corporate America. She points out that part of a CEO's job is to project confidence — in their own companies, in the markets and in the broader economy. "They have no control over what the government is going to do, regardless of how they feel," says Tavis. And, she adds: "Obviously, they want to be on the winning side of whatever happens." Behind the scenes, the conversation is more candid. CEOs "are very discouraged," says Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who hosted a gathering of CEOs on Tuesday. 80% of those CEOs say "that they find themselves apologizing to our international partners for Trump's capriciousness," Sonnenfeld told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. And, he added, "roughly 70% said the Trump administration is going to be bad for the economy." Those numbers are a sharp contrast to the Conference Board's rosier findings last month. It regularly polls the heads of the largest U.S. companies, and it finished its latest survey on February 10 — after Trump had first announced, then first delayed, his new 25% tariffs against Mexico and Canada. "I know people were surprised that we saw this increase in CEO confidence at the time that tariffs may [start to] have a negative impact on the economy," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, told NPR last week. Many of the CEOs surveyed in late January and early February did tell the Conference Board that they're worried about tariffs, she added. But at the time, business leaders said they were more focused on Trump's other, business-friendlier promises, including deregulation and lower taxes. Still, Guichard is curious to see what CEOs tell the Conference Board in two months, when it next polls America's business leaders. "A lot can happen between now and May," she says.
