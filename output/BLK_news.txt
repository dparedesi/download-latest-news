Nearly half the population still has private health cover. Photo: Stock image/Getty Healthcare Sir — All parties are signed up to implement the Sláintecare plan of 2017. One of its key principles is equitable access to healthcare. OECD research has shown Ireland has one of the most inequitable hospital care systems, and voluntary private health insurance was found to be the largest contributor to that inequity, a fact not referred to in Sláintecare. Róisín Shortall, chair of the Oireachtas committee that developed the plan, said in a radio interview in 2017 that there would be such a good public hospital service after implementation of the plan that only 20pc of the population would need to buy private health insurance. After nearly eight years of the 10-year plan, 47pc of the population continue to have private health insurance. Through the acceptance of funding of private hospital care by private insurance in the Sláintecare plan, all political parties have ensured there will be quicker access to private hospital care and insurers clinics, such as VHI’s 360 Health Centres or Laya’s Health and Wellbeing Clinics, than that afforded to non-insured patients to public hospital care. The two-tier system between private and public hospitals will flourish, as manifested, for example, in the recently announced €500m investment by the Larry Goodman Trust at the Blackrock Health Hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Limerick. I have just retired after 33 years as a hospital consultant and a period in political activism campaigning for a health system that treated patients as patients and not as private or public. I deplore the fact that our political system and its Sláintecare plan will ensure this wealthy country will have embedded in its system in 2025, and for the foreseeable future, inequitable access to hospital care funded by private health insurance. Dr John Barton, Ballymoneen Road, Galway Sir — Colin Murphy’s exploration of the contradictions of Elon Musk was apposite (‘We need to talk about Elon’, January 12). Musk’s vision of free speech is less a democratic ideal than a digital oligarchy, where the loudest voice belongs to the wealthiest player. In this skewed marketplace of ideas, engagement becomes currency, outrage reigns supreme and truth is reduced to collateral damage. What Musk offers is not free speech, but expensive influence, reshaping public discourse in his own image — a cautionary tale of how technology, when wielded by the powerful, can amplify echo chambers rather than challenge them. Governments and democratic institutions must act to safeguard public discourse. Social media platforms should be regulated for transparency and fairness, with algorithms prevented from artificially amplifying individual voices. Limiting monopolistic control and supporting independent journalism are essential to combat misinformation. Global standards for online free speech, coupled with independent oversight, can ensure accountability, while fostering decentralised platforms provides alternatives to profit-driven networks. Together, these measures can help protect democracy from the distortion of digital power and influence. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Sir — The outgoing government promised to enact the Occupied Territories Bill. It seems as though the incoming coalition may decide similarly. The bare-faced theft of Pales­tinian land continues and the Israeli government and its people continue to ignore the International Court of Justice and world opinion. While I would love to see Ireland and other western countries cutting off all commercial and academic ties with all of Israel, certain actions just aren’t practicable I would like the same for relations with Russia and a few others, but we live in an interconnected world and sometimes you deal with people because you have to, not because you want to. Israel may be small in physical extent, but it is powerful militarily and politically. I can easily envisage a situation in which corporate America decides to discourage foreign direct investment in Ireland and in which American companies decide to leave Ireland, all for the sake of supporting Israel. Those advocates urging that bill now becomes law should ask themselves if they are willing to lose their jobs for the sake of this fine move, where no other country will follow us. Anthony Hanrahan, Salruck, Renvyle, Co Galway Sir – When Bray Bridge Club held one of its main events last week, the winning men’s pair on the night were George Daly and John Hautz. There is great karma in John’s story. The club moved into a beautiful new premises on the same night. It was built as a school in the 1880s. John Hautz recalls it was the first school he attended in — wait for it — 1940. So, 85 years later, John wins in his alma mater. By the way, and contrary to many people’s perception, you don’t need to be of senior years to play bridge. Some of our best are under 30, but it is a game for life. Anyone interested in learning should check out the website cbai.ie. Brendan Martin, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — Emigration to Australia and other English-speaking countries by Irish teachers means the immigrant countries are getting for free teachers trained by Ireland — and they can afford to pay them more. Meanwhile, Irish school authorities are generally hostile to foreign-trained teachers. I have been comparing teacher salaries in Melbourne, where primary teachers are paid from €48,000 to €75,000 in steps over 10 years. Here we have a ridiculous 27-step pay scale (for doing the same job) not found elsewhere. A pensioned teacher earns nearly as much as a novice. It used be there were 32 students for each Irish teacher; it is now 16.5. The average class size here is 23. That’s the same as in Australia but Japan copes with 38 pupils per class. (It was 73 in my first class in Coláiste Mhuire.) I’ve ignored the fact that we have teaching assistants now. We have done away with the primary school examination, so we can no longer measure performance. And it seems we can’t afford the level of kindergarten schooling required. Only social media gives us an indication, and it is awful. To deal with the current problem of teachers emigrating to seek better pay and the prospect of buying their own home, I would like to offer these three suggestions. 1. Start new teachers on the seventh increment of the current pay in selected areas to match Australia. 2. Build or buy homes near schools and make them available to teachers while they are employed there. This would kill commuting and create some interest and competence in teachers in their local history and heritage, now missing. 3. Bring back a performance test for primary school-leavers. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Sir — What is the voting public to make of the shenanigans taking place with the formation of the new government? Do they have no shame? Apparently, government ministers are overworked, so there is a requirement for three extra junior ministers. Pull the other one. The pigs are at the trough. Then we have the jobless Independents setting up a technical group so they can be part of the opposition — even though they have sold their souls by pledging to support the new government. How does that work? It is a mockery. I say they have sold their souls because they will have to support unpopular policies, like the carbon tax and not putting in place a no-fault eviction ban. Do they think they can speak against a policy as part of the opposition and then vote for the legislation in the Dáil? It also means that even though they support the government, they will take opposition speaking time, leaders’ questions and chairs of Oireachtas Committees. In short, it will undermine opposition to the government. It makes a travesty of democracy. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The Regional Independent Group agreed a Programme for Government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and now wishes to sit on the opposition benches at the same time. It’s quite clear that some of said group have never contemplated actually being in govern­ment and have allowed the prospect go completely to their heads. Perhaps someone should explain that it’s like playing a Gaelic football match and during the game some players are permitted to run to the sideline and shout down their own teammates. I fear a five-year episode of Father Ted approaches. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan ​ Sir — As Groucho Marx once said: “These are my principles, and if you don’t like them, well, I have others.” This can now become the official motto of our new government and its Independent members. Amazing how so many alleged red lines become irrelevant when power comes beckoning. And we wonder why only half our citizens vote? Tony O’Gorman, Limerick ​ Sir — If I had run for election for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, I would be asking myself why I hadn’t stood as an Independent, considering a group of nine Independents has bizarrely secured five ministerial jobs, while another has already secured the Ceann Comhairle post. The acro­nym Gubu comes to mind. John McGeady, Blackrock, Co Louth Sir — Independent TD Danny Healy-Rae has pledged to supp­ort the new government. His brother Michael is to become a junior minister. I wonder how they’ll cap that? Eithne MacFadden, Carrigart, Co Donegal ​ Sir — The general election is now history and the next government is ready to go. There are no by-elections on the political horizon, though they have been known to emerge quickly. The election of 2025 is going to be the race for Áras an Uachtaráin. Wayne O’Connor assessed a number of contenders (January 12), but there does not appear to be any contender standing out as a clear favourite yet. In 1990, Dick Spring pulled a rabbit out of the hat when he convinced Mary Robinson to run for Labour after they had had a poor general election showing. A precedent was set, and there could be a lesson in this for all the political leaders. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo ​ Sir — Your editorial that Paschal Donohoe should be given the housing portfolio in the new government would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious (‘Give Paschal Donohoe a shot at solving the housing crisis’, January 12). The bibliophile minister presided over the biggest giveaway budget in the history of the State last October (against the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council), which is fuelling inflation again, not least house prices, which are predicted to increase by 7pc to 10pc again this year, according to estate agents. That’s an additional €35,000 that savers will need to find to purchase just an ordinary home where the median house price in the country now stands at €350,000. With a shortage of plumbers, electricians and carpenters now beginning to emerge from the construction industry, one wonders in what book of traditional economic theory will the Public Expenditure Minister, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform find the answers that your editorial so wishes. The good people of Kerry decided not to elect a Fine Gael TD in the general election. They saw through the spin. When will the rest of the country come to realise that it is the current Government’s neo-liberal housing policies that are making the situation worse, not better? Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry ​ Sir — On January 24, we celebrate the International Day of Education, recognising its vital role in promoting peace and development. As a Muslim woman living in Ireland and a member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, I want to highlight that Islam strongly supports education for both men and women. In Islam, education is not just encouraged, it is a fundamental duty. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community embodies these teachings by promoting education worldwide. As we celebrate this day, let’s remember that education is a powerful tool for equality and empowerment. By embracing these values in Ireland and beyond, we can create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Nudrat Jahan Malik, Bettystown, Co Meath Sir — How many more excellent articles, like Eilis O’Hanlon’s last Sunday, and appeals from those concerned about the welfare of mothers and children are required before a proper robust debate takes place, resulting in the provision of choice for mothers and babies? It’s a long time since the late, great Nora Bennis campaigned for mothers in the home and was rebuffed by so-called women’s organisations. How hypocritical it is that we are constantly hearing of the importance of choice, but on this issue, seemingly, it is only heeded when it aligns with the views of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, generously supported by the government. The issue demonstrates the total lack of support for families and family life, leading to so many social problems and, ultimately, to homelessness. Any hope of an awakening to the problems mounting up and the promotion of a stable and content society? Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town ​ Sir — While she may live in a very different world to the vast majority, Kate Middleton has been remarkably plain-spoken about having cancer and all the trauma this entails. It is heartening that she is now in remission. I was also pleased to hear her good news thus expressed without any reference to getting “the all-clear”, which from experience is, I feel, an expression that frequently bestows a false level of expectation on the cancer patient, their family and friends. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny ​ Sir — Sam McBride wrote last week that unionists might one day consider Irish unification, but never our flag, the Tricolour. I suggest a compromise — a new flag consisting of the Tricolour with the red hand of Ulster taking its place in the white band. Perhaps this would be acceptable to both sides. What do your readers think? Bernard Naughton, Farranree, Co Cork ​ Sir — Your columnist Declan Lynch claims no sensible person can love “remorseless” Manchester City. Well, I have been a City supporter for over 50 years and I am a very sensible person. Sour grapes could be the problem — Declan supports Liverpool.

Title: Trump says he may give TikTok a 90-day reprieve on Monday

World Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. WASHINGTON: TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday (Jan 18) and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the platform used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 0345 GMT (11.45am Singapore time): "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned." Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." TikTok users logging on late on Saturday were met with a message that said the law would "force us to make our services temporarily unavailable. We're working to restore our service in the US as soon as possible". It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. The Chinese-owned app, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, said on Friday it will go dark in the US on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. After the court defeat, TikTok CEO Shou Chew appealed to Trump, thanking him for his "commitment to work with us to find a solution". Trump "truly understands our platform", he added. Chew is also set to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday. The law requires Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores, blocking new downloads. The companies could face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user who can access the app. Oracle, which hosts TikTok's servers, would also be legally obligated to enforce the ban. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown on Sunday. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. A last-minute proposal made Saturday by the highly-valued start-up Perplexity AI offered a merger with the US subsidiary of TikTok, a source with knowledge of the deal told AFP. That deal could allow parent company ByteDance a possible solution without selling off the app entirely. The plan, first reported by US broadcaster CNBC, would create a new joint venture combining the assets of US TikTok and Perplexity AI, which has been backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The proposal did not include a price for the transaction, but the source estimated it would be at least US$50 billion. Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner, has also made an offer to purchase TikTok's US activity and said he's "ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal". Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary, who is involved in that offer, told Fox News that ByteDance was offered US$20 billion for TikTok's US operation. He acknowledged the legal uncertainty over the case, with it remaining an open question whether an executive order by Trump to halt the ban would override the law. "Congress wrote this law to be virtually president-proof," warned Adam Kovacevich, chief executive of industry trade group Chamber of Progress. Sarah Kreps, a professor of government and law at Cornell University, said that "if an executive order conflicts with an existing law, the law takes precedence, and the order can be struck down by the courts". With TikTok forced into a shutdown, its US-based rivals Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could reap benefits. Thousands of worried TikTok users have protectively turned to Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), a Chinese social media network similar to Instagram. Nicknamed "Red Note" by its American users, it was the most downloaded app on the US Apple Store this week.

Title: Long-term benefits predicted from restoration of domestic energy production
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/long-term-benefits-predicted-from-restoration-of-domestic-energy-production/

By James Varney. Real Clear Wire January 18, 2025 The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

Title: Four of Canada's biggest banks leave climate alliance

Toronto By Ian Bickis, The Canadian Press Posted January 18, 2025 9:03 am. Last Updated January 18, 2025 10:04 am. TORONTO — Four of Canada’s biggest banks have left the UN-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance that aims to accelerate climate action among financial institutions. Banks including BMO, National Bank, TD Bank Group and CIBC confirmed Friday they were no longer members. The withdrawals from the alliance follow on departures by the six largest banks in the U.S. in recent weeks ahead of the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. Financial institutions are pulling back following sustained criticism from U.S. Republicans on various climate alliances and the very concept of factoring environmental risks into their business operations. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative earlier this month in a move that led the group to suspend activities and launch a review of the initiative, citing “recent developments in the U.S.” Canadian banks did not cite issues in the U.S. for why they were leaving the alliance, but in statements said they are able to continue with their climate work without the help of the group. BMO spokesman Jeff Roman said the bank is fully committed to its climate strategy and supporting its clients in the transition to net zero. “We have robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements,” he said. National Bank said it left the alliance as it streamlines how it reports on its plans and progress. It said it would have a pragmatic approach and work with companies in all sectors to decarbonize. TD said it has what it needs to advance its strategy and advise its clients as they adapt their businesses. CIBC said the alliance was formed when the global industry was scaling up climate efforts but that the space has evolved enough for it to go it alone. “Having made significant progress alongside our clients in these areas, we are now well-positioned to further this work outside of the formal structure of the NZBA,” said spokesman Tom Wallis. The withdrawal of banks from the alliance shows the need for government to step in, said Greenpeace senior energy strategist Keith Stewart. “To call this a craven act of cowardice on climate would be too kind,” Stewart said in a statement. “It does, however, demonstrate that if we want to avoid more communities being burned or flooded in climate-fuelled disasters by moving big money out of fossil fuels and into climate solutions, then we need governments to regulate banks the same way they do smokestacks and tailpipes.” At a Jan. 7 conference RBC chief executive Dave McKay said the alliance was in flux and questioned whether it was the right mechanism to reduce emissions. The bank was still listed as a member as of early Saturday, as was Scotiabank and credit unions Vancity and Coast Capital. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 18, 2025.

Title: JPMorgan and BlackRock C-suite departure surprises show why succession in finance is extra tricky, experts say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. CEO candidate departures at BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase show that finding an exceptional replacement is tough, and keeping good candidates committed is a challenge in itself. The departure announcements of possible CEO successors at both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase are the latest reminders that CEO transitions are anything but simple, experts say, especially when it comes to the world’s top finance jobs. Mark Wiedman, BlackRock’s top client-facing executive and a possible successor to CEO Larry Fink, said Wednesday he would voluntarily step away from his role in the spring after a 20-year stint at the firm. On the same day, two JPMorgan executives apparently took their names out of the running to replace the longest serving CEO of a major bank, Jamie Dimon (One is retiring and the other reportedly has no interest in the role.) Both examples prove the difficulty of replacing a longtime leader, and in finance, the transition process is particularly difficult, said Chris Stanley, Moody’s senior director and its banking industry practice lead. A potential CEO candidate needs to have a good grasp of the complexities of the business in any industry. But in finance they also need to be familiar with the increasing regulations imposed on the industry over the last 30 years, said Stanley. And in modern finance, so much specialization is required in operations, finance, sales, and risk, that it’s hard to find a candidate with a strong understanding of each area. “As the bank gets larger, the kind of specialization, or the expertise that's required in those four broad areas, but then individually, in each of the business units of the bank just becomes a really hard thing to to contain in one person,” Stanley told Fortune. On top of the hard skills required for the job, he added that big bank and finance CEOs need to have the charisma to sell a shared vision of the firm’s direction to employees, shareholders, and the board. “In a commodity business like banking, where the margins are so thin, it's a pretty compelling story you have to tell to say, ‘We're going to change what we're doing. We're going to invest over here. This is where we see opportunity,’” he said. To add yet another complicating factor to the mix, top executives are likely on someone’s radar elsewhere. When an employee is identified as a candidate for the CEO job, whether by their company or the media, they may reconsider when other opportunities come knocking, said Larry Hartmann, CEO of global talent advisory firm ZRG Partners. This is especially true if the candidate isn’t confident that they’ll beat out the other contenders. Hartmann, whose firm has helped Subway and the NCAA find their top leaders, said even getting on the shortlist for the top job raises your profile for top recruiters like him. “They’re going to be someone that another organization would value,” Hartmann told Fortune. “They’re kind of referenced in a strong way already by being mentioned in that light.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Federal Judge Blasts DEI and BlackRock's 'Incestuous' Relationship in New Ruling

Time Published: 2025-01-18T14:19:35Z
Full Content:
A federal judge in Texas ruled against American Airlines after the company centered employee retirement plans on environmental, social, and governance factors, also known as ESG. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor concluded on Jan. 10 that American Airlines failed to exercise its fiduciary duty to make investment decisions for retirement accounts based on the best interests of the beneficiaries, according to a report from Reuters. O’Connor added that American Airlines had inappropriate ties to BlackRock, the asset management behemoth which has long been a leading advocate for the ESG investing movement. “The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan,” O’Connor wrote in the decision. The decision came after a class action lawsuit from American Airlines pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of some 100,000 retirement savings participants. O’Connor will decide at a later date whether the beneficiaries suffered harm and whether the airline must pay damages. A spokesperson for BlackRock denied in a statement to Reuters that the company’s emphasis on ESG diminishes the creation of investment value. “We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients,” the spokesperson asserted. “Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices.” Reuters noted that the ruling may have been the first of its kind since conservatives increased their criticisms of the ESG movement in recent years as pushing left-wing social objectives while distracting from the maximization of returns for investors. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research and an opponent of ESG, celebrated the decision on Jan. 10 via social media, asserting that “any company” which uses BlackRock “could be held liable in the same way” if the ruling holds. BlackRock left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative on Jan. 9 following a recent lawsuit from Texas and other Republican-led states. The entity, which committed major players in the asset management industry to “a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximise long-term value of assets,” entirely ceased operations after the departure of BlackRock, per a Monday report from the New York Post. The court decision and collapse of the ESG group arguably continue a trend away from diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate America. Walmart, one of the largest private-sector employers in the country, recently reversed many DEI programs after pressure from conservative activist Robby Starbuck, while social media companies owned by Meta also shuttered DEI initiatives.

Title: TikTok faces US ban deadline as users brace for fallout

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the platform used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," the message notified users trying to use the app late on Saturday night. Even if temporary, the unprecedented shutdown of TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, is set to have a wide-ranging impact on U.S.-China relations, U.S. domestic politics, the social media marketplace and millions of Americans who depend on the app economically and culturally. The United States has never banned a major social media platform. The law passed overwhelmingly by Congress gives the incoming Trump administration sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps. Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app CapCut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday." It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users, and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provided assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. MOVE TO ALTERNATIVES Under the law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform had until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. Biden's White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the White House statement. The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said. Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users - mostly younger people - scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Snap have seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. "This is my new home now," wrote a user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words "tiktokrefugee" and "sad". Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. "I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days," wrote @RavenclawJedi. 'HAIR ON FIRE' MOMENT NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was "experiencing temporary technical difficulties." Web searches for "VPN" spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans in what one executive described as a "hair on fire" moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.

Title: Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby

Munster are clinging on to second place in Pool 3 of the Champions Cup by the slenderest of margins ahead of Saracens, namely a points difference of +29 as against +28, with both teams on 10 match points. Clinging on somehow seems apt, much like their status as one of European rugby’s grandees. Realistically, therefore, Munster probably have to beat Northampton in Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday afternoon (kick-off 3.15pm) to ensure they finish above the Saints and thus ensure themselves of a home tie in the Round of 16 for the first time in three seasons. Otherwise the expectation must be that Saracens will better Munster’s result when they host Castres 24 hours later. Failure to progress beyond the Round of 16 would mean Munster going three successive campaigns without reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since the inaugural three seasons of the competition from 1995-96 to 1997-98, ie, back when the Irish provinces didn’t really count. Even as things stand Munster have only reached one quarter-final in the last five seasons, when losing to Toulouse in a goal-kicking competition after an epic stalemate over 100 minutes. Although it tells us much about the Munster’s hierarchy’s priorities that this match had to be played in the Aviva Stadium as, despite the quarter-final weekend being known in advance, they had leased out Thomond Park for Ed Sheeran concerts. There has been one Round of 16 tie behind closed doors and a first leg of a two-legged last 16 tie, but the last time Munster hosted a quarter-final at Thomond Park was in 2018, when Andrew Conway’s try manufactured a trademark Houdini-esque act of escapism against Toulon. For sure Munster have had some wonderful players in that time, and they are a well-coached squad. They couldn’t have won the URC title two seasons ago, or finished top of the regular 18-game campaign last season, without still being a good side. But a third successive season without a third Champions Cup tie at Thomond Park, and that invaluable source of revenue, would be revisiting those mid-90s years. And a seventh successive season without a quarter-final at Thomond Park would be a famine. Compare and contrast with the ensuing 20 seasons from 1998-99 to 2017-18, when Munster reached 17 quarter-finals, of which nine were in Limerick, and one in Lansdowne Road while Thomond Park was being redeveloped. The late, great Garrett Fitzgerald was CEO of Munster for those two decades, and maintained Munster’s achievements were a miracle given Leinster’s socio-economic advantages. Even so they seem to have become a comparatively mismanaged machine since those halcyon days, and they are producing increasingly less players for international rugby. True, the class of the Noughties was a golden generation. But this week’s two Irish squad announcements for the Six Nations and the Under-20 Six Nations are instructive. Simon Easterby’s 36-man squad contains only five Munster players, the same as Connacht, one more than Ulster, and 18 less than Leinster. Munster fans can argue all they want about individual cases such as Tom Ahern, Gavin Coombes and Alex Kendellen, while Oli Jager and Craig Casey are injured, and under David Nucifora the IRFU’s focus became too based on Leinster to the detriment of the other three provinces. But, however much you dress it up, Munster have inexorably become less productive. The Munster quintet contain two world-class players, Peter O’Mahony and Conor Murray – 34 and 35 respectively. Each still makes Munster a better team, but Murray this week admitted he is not even considering his future beyond this season, and this campaign may be a last dance for the pair of them in the wake of Keith Earls, Simon Zebo and others. Of the others Tadhg Beirne is a product of the Leinster system – although where Munster would have been without him for the last seven seasons doesn’t bear thinking about. Which leaves Jack Crowley, an outhalf from Bandon, and Calvin Nash, a winger from Limerick. While there is talent coming through in the considerable ability of Brian Gleeson, Ruadhán Quinn and others, there’s no sign of Munster suddenly yielding a richer harvest. Neil Doak’s 31-man under-20s squad has a similar and familiar breakdown, with 17 Leinster players, five apiece from Munster and Ulster, three from Connacht, and one from England. Of the Munster quintet the promising ex-CBC and Constitution prop Michael Foy, now with UCC, has had his progress delayed by injury. The lock Conor Kennelly is also a product of CBC and Con, and now with Highfield. Ironically, the under-20s captain and backrower Eanna McCarthy is also a product of CBC, but seemingly didn’t fit in the Munster academy, and having been chased by the other three, pitched up in Connacht and Galwegians. The 19-year-old Munster academy centre Gene O’Leary Kareem is a product of Highfield and PBC, whom he captained to the Munster Schools Senior Cup final win over CBC last season. Another is centre Eoghan Smyth, a 19-year-old product of Midleton College who doubtless owes his inclusion through his eye-catching performances as an ever-present in the All-Ireland League this season with Cork Constitution. And there should be a lesson in this. The stylish Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, who has also been playing regularly in Division 1A of the AIL with Garryowen, is a product of Bantry. Admittedly, the Shannon prop Emmet Calvey and the flanker Luke Murphy, who hails from Cratloe in Clare and came through Shannon and Ardscoil Rís, were stars of last year’s under-20s team and are still eligible but currently injured. Yet there are no forwards from Limerick or its surrounding feeder area in either the Irish senior or under-20s squad, something that would have been unthinkable even 15 years ago. Back in Ireland’s 2009 Grand Slam campaign of the 40 players who were part of the Irish squad, 15 came from Munster, 12 from Leinster, eight from Ulster and five from across the water, with none from Connacht. Nine years later of the 36 players named in the original squad and four subsequent call-ups in that Grand Slam campaign, Leinster had become bulk suppliers with 19, but Munster still provided 12, with five from Ulster and four from Connacht. Talking to several well-placed people inside Munster rugby the primary problem appears to be the ongoing attempt to ape the Leinster system without having anything like similar resources and competitive standards. Thanks to the superior facilities and wages paid to coaches in Blackrock College, St Michael’s, Gonzaga et al, Leinster have a conveyor belt of ready-made talent for their academy system. Such are their numbers Leinster can afford some players slipping through the system. Some schools in Munster do put a focus on nurturing young rugby talent. For example, Johnny Holland the oversees the CBC programme and Duncan Williams is their head coach. But others depend on a perfect storm, ie Seán Skehan coaching a Glenstal team with Ben Healy, or can flit between focusing on rugby or hurling/Gaelic football. Individually the Munster clubs and schools cannot hope to emulate Leinster. Akin to Connacht, they should start working together rather than separately, and stop preventing players from continuing their playing ties with the clubs who introduced them to the game. In those vital development years of, say, 12 to 15, talented young players need specialist coaching and improved competition structures rather than being coached by voluntary teachers or PE teachers. Munster need to find a Munster way, and delve into their famed club game, where most are struggling to field second teams, or in some cases even under-20s teams. Limerick clubs won 13 of the first 19 AILs. They’ve not had one winner since Shannon in 2009. By all accounts the soap opera that is Munster is riven with divides among the clubs themselves, or the clubs and the schools. The decline in production lines from Limerick comes at a time when the squad, senior and academy, has been based exclusively in their High Performance Centre in the University of Limerick, and when Thomond Park has become Munster’s primary home more than ever. And this, of course, leads to the elephant in the room, namely the Limerick/Cork divide, and specifically the profound disenchantment and thorough disengagement within Cork. Granted, Thomond Park was being redeveloped in that 2008-09 season when Cork hosted nine Magners League matches, including the Leinster game. But the following season Cork hosted three Magners League games, against the Dragons, Edinburgh and Scarlets. Two seasons ago it was Zebre, Lions and Scarlets; last season the Dragons, Glasgow and Zebre, and this season the Ospreys’ visit for Munster’s rain-drenched 23-0 win in October will be followed by Edinburgh in February and Benetton in May. So disaffected have the Cork rugby fraternity become that many have ceased travelling to Thomond Park for games. Donal Lenihan has been banging this drum for years, and calling aloud for the festive Leinster game to be moved to Páirc Uí Chaoimh, where the games against the Crusaders and South Africa in the last two seasons drew 40,000-plus capacity crowds. This would be a significant gesture of goodwill toward Munster’s Cork following, yet apparently the excuse for not doing so was that hotel rooms were already booked for Leinster. Well, then, plan in advance. Leinster don’t have to be paid to pitch up in Cork or Limerick, whereas the Crusaders were reputedly paid €250,000 and the Springboks €280,000. Munster’s current CEO Ian Flanagan recently told the Irish Examiner that “the financials aren’t compelling” enough to switch an existing league fixture from Thomond Park to the home of Cork GAA. No doubt that went down like a lead balloon in Cork. If Leinster can move a derby to Croke Park and Connacht move one to MacHale Park then Munster can do likewise. Munster need to start thinking outside the box. The province needs a rethink and a revamp to find solutions within. They could do worse than find some overseeing role for Declan Kidney, who gets the Munster zeitgeist and the Cork-Limerick divide. In his last six seasons as head coach he took the province to their four Heineken Cup finals, and he is in Cork after his four years as director of rugby at London Irish. On this day all of this might seem ill-timed and negative. The fervent hope remains that Munster secure a home Round of 16 tie, that somehow they even earn an overdue Thomond Park quarter-final. No less than Ulster and Connacht, as Matt Williams argues elsewhere in this section, Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby. It needs a stronger Munster than its current version. The consequences of a continuing decline in how the province is run and managed would be disastrous. And not just for Munster. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: AIL preview: Trip to Young Munster a stern test for leaders St Mary’s

The leaders St Mary’s return to Tom Clifford Park for the first time in eight years with a side featuring both of their ex-Young Munster players, prolific fullback Conor Hayes and the former Munster centre Dan Goggin. The latter will be opposing his brother, Tom, who starts in the home side’s secondrow, as was the case when the sides met in round eight six weeks ago. St Mary’s prevailed that day by 26-24, with their ex-Munster centre scoring their fourth try and Hayes landing three conversions. This fixture has always had a certain resonance ever since Young Munster beat St Mary’s in a title decider at Lansdowne Road in 1993. The home side sit sixth but are only five points behind Mark McHugh’s side, who were blunted a week ago by Lansdowne. Young Munster recorded a fine derby win over Garryowen last week but Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn are travelling reserves for Munster’s Champions Cup game in Northampton, and outhalf Tony Butler is on the bench in Franklin’s Gardens. The 11th round comprises the return fixtures from the eighth round in early December, when four of the five top-flight games were decided by four points or less. The exception was Clontarf’s handsome win in Ballynahinch, and after their game in Armagh was postponed last week, they will be favourites to complete the double at Castle Avenue. As well as having the Leinster duo of Alex Soroka and Brian Deeney up front, the Clontarf team features Hugh Cooney, named this week as a development player in the Irish squad. With Jake Flannery on Ulster duty, James Humphreys reverts to outhalf for ‘Hinch, who welcome back influential centre George Pringle. Third-placed Terenure host UCD and welcome back Chris Cosgrave, who nailed the last-ditch penalty to beat the students in the corresponding clash at the Bowl. Aran Egan reverts to outhalf, while Leinster’s John McKee returns at hooker. Emmet MacMahon, forwards coach when Terenure won their maiden AIL two seasons ago, returns to Lakelands with a UCD team featuring six Leinster players, including Andrew Osborne on the wing. Fourth-placed Cork Con will look to continue their steady climb up the table when hosting Garryowen at Temple Hill, having been hard-pressed to beat the bottom-placed side 19-17 last time around. The champions have restored James Taylor at outhalf but while Garryowen welcome back loosehead George Hadden they are again without the stardust of Brian Gleeson and also fellow Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks. Lansdowne, who will be eyeing up a top four finish after last week’s win at St Mary’s put them within seven points of the playoffs, host City of Armagh on the Aviva back pitch on Sunday due to the Leinster-Bath game. Last May, Old Belvedere went to the Thomond Park back pitch and beat Shannon 46-8 in the promotion/relegation semi-final playoffs. Eight months on and the in-form Belvo return atop 1B against a Shannon side who have swiftly dropped to last in the second tier. Nenagh Ormond, just three points adrift, seek to maintain the pace in Naas, while Trinity host third-placed Old Wesley and Blackrock travel to UCC in a meeting of fourth and fifth. The free-scoring pacesetters in 2A, Corinthians and Instonians, are at home to Banbridge and Cashel, as are third and fourth placed Greystones and MU Barnhall against Ballymena and Old Crescent. Saturday Men Division 1A: Clontarf v Ballynahinch, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Garryowen, Temple Hill; Terenure College v UCD, Lakelands; Young Munster v St Mary’s College, Tom Clifford Park. Division 1B: Dublin University v Old Wesley, College Park; Naas v Nenagh Ormond, Forenaughts; Queen’s v Highfield, Dub Lane; Shannon v Old Belvedere, Thomond Park; UCC v Blackrock College, Mardyke.

Title: ‘There’s people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sarsfields win... it’s just a jealously’ – Ben O’Connor

Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile ​Standing in Croke Park last July for the 25th anniversary of Cork’s 1999 All-Ireland hurling win, Ben O’Connor remembers looking around and finding it hard to absorb that it had actually been that long since that rain-soaked day in the same stadium that was in the middle of its redevelopment phase at the time. In beating Kilkenny, Cork had ended a famine, nine years long since their previous All-Ireland title. “I said where did that time go,” he recalled. “At the time in Cork that was considered a famine. Now we’re double that and another small bit with it. Even that 1999 or early 2000s team [which went on to win two subsequent All-Irelands in 2004 and 2005], there was a lot thought of them because they were the last team to win. It would be nice now if a new crop of fellas could be talked about.” That Liam MacCarthy Cup famine now runs parallel with the county’s All-Ireland club famine too. Look back at the history of the competition since its inception for the 1970/’71 season and you get a sense of just how dominant Cork club teams were in those early years. Tipperary’s Roscrea won the inaugural competition in 1971 but after that it was the preserve of three Cork city clubs, Glen Rovers, Blackrock and St Finbarr’s for seven of the next eight years, only interrupted by Kilkenny’s James Stephens. But since then the flow of the 1970s has become a trickle and just two All-Ireland title wins have been celebrated on Leeside, Midleton in 1988 and Newtownshandrum in 2004. In the meantime, Kilkenny and Galway have forged ahead with 14 titles each, five ahead of Cork’s collective nine. Cork clubs have struggled to make any mark at provincial level in recent years so Sarsfields’ progress to tomorrow’s All-Ireland final against Dublin’s Na Fianna is an outlier, even more pronounced because they lost to Ballygunner by 17 points in the 2023 Munster Championship. Sarsfields selector Diarmuid O'Sullivan celebrating after the All-Ireland club SHC semi-final win over Slaughtneil. Photo: Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile O’Connor and twin brother Jerry were chief architects behind Newtownshandrum’s 2004 win as they developed a possession game that wasn’t to everyone’s taste at the time, one which Cork modified to win those last two All-Ireland titles. Since then, the All-Ireland club championship has been a wasteland for Cork senior clubs with just Newtonshandrum returning to a final, which they lost to a Joe Canning-inspired Portumna, two years later. “It doesn’t happen too often,” acknowledged O’Connor, who is full of admiration for Sarsfields because of how they turned the 2023 result around against Ballygunner. He earnestly hopes there’ll be no more talk of Newtownshandrum as the last Cork champions after this weekend. “They could have downed tools, the same as they did last year,” he said. “They won the county last year and got that hiding off Ballygunner. They didn’t want that happening again and they got their bit of luck along the way. “I think they’ve got better every day they’ve played since. Hopefully on Sunday there’ll be no more talk of Newtown being the last team to win the All-Ireland club from Cork and they’ll be talking about someone else. It’s great for Cork hurling. After Watergrasshill [All-Ireland intermediate champions] and Russell Rovers [All-Ireland junior finalists] last weekend, it would be nice to finish the whole thing off with Sars lifting the trophy.” O’Connor would love to see it and so would many others in Cork but not everyone, he acknowledged, as the competitive fires burn intensely. “There are people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sars winning. There are people above in Tyrone who don’t want to see Errigal Ciarán winning. It’s just a jealousy, I suppose. I’m a Corkman so I want to see Cork teams winning everything, no matter what they’re at. Local rivalry has to be put aside at this stage. They’re representing Cork, they’re the Cork team at the weekend so everybody should be behind Sars.” O’Connor managed Cork to the All-Ireland U-20 title in 2023 and has stepped away from the role now. But some of those players that played under him are graduating and as the swell of talent in Cork rises, O’Connor is sure that a Sarsfields win tomorrow would be a further catalyst. “It shows that the team that has won your county title is the best in the country so why can’t every other team below there think the same? The draws for the club championship have been made in Cork and there are at least four teams saying, ‘We’re better than Sars’. Now, Sars are in an All-Ireland final yet they’re saying that they’re better than them, so it’s bound to drive things on a small bit. I just think it’s great that we have a team involved at this stage.” O’Connor has no immediate ambition to return to inter-county management and cautions about the time pressure being placed on the best players now because of the split season. “Take Jack O’Connor. He loses the All-Ireland final [as part of the Cork squad], he gets a week to drown his sorrows then he’s back in with the club, he’s going then until Sunday with Sars. He’ll probably get two weeks off and then he’s back in with Cork. “For a fella that got beaten in the semi-final of a Cork championship, he’s finished at the end of September, he’s probably back training two weeks after that. So the good fella gets no break whereas before, when you had seasons [running] together, you had some chance. The better fellas have no chance. It’s great for the club player because his year is done out for him, clubs aren’t playing championship until August.” Ben (right) and Jerry O'Connor with the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2004. Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile Ben and Jerry O’Connor feature in one of the Laochra Gael programmes that are being broadcast from next week on TG4 and Ben said it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. “Looking down the road, I have three small ones and Jerry has three small ones, so it’s nice for them to be able to see the few clips and be able to see what went on back in the day,” he said. “They [the children] haven’t a clue really. They know we played hurling and they’re made for hurling themselves, but they don’t know the full story of everything so it’s nice to be able to look back. And you get this done for you. You don’t have to go and do it yourself so I suppose that’s a nice side of it.” The telepathy between the twins is a feature of their programme but Ben is adamant their understanding never compromised a decision made on the field. “I got to know his game, he got to know mine,” said Ben of Jerry. “I still like to think in a game that if the right thing to do was pass the ball, whether it was Jerry there or someone else there, I’d make the right decision. I wouldn’t like to think ‘I’ll pass it because it is Jerry’. And I know I didn’t. If it was the right thing to do, it was the right thing to do.”​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Title: Unusual Situation in Gold & Silver Market May Spark Big Price Moves

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 4:16:40 PM PST by delta7 The monetary metals pulled back sharply yesterday but have entered Tuesday on stable footing. Silver is trading at $29.90 –and gold is $2,674. The ongoing volatility is a reflection of uncertainty in the gold and silver markets globally, including fears of import tariffs from the incoming Trump administration. If Trump slaps a tariff of, say, 10% on precious metals coming into the U.S., that would have a huge impact. 10% on silver would amount to $3 per ounce! As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

If Trump slaps a tariff of, say, 10% on precious metals coming into the U.S., that would have a huge impact. 10% on silver would amount to $3 per ounce! As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

Title: The Tennessee-BlackRock Settlement: A Win for Transparency and Investor Interests

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In a high-stakes showdown that captured the attention of investors nationwide, the State of Tennessee has reached a settlement with BlackRock, Inc. regarding its use of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the management of U.S. mutual funds. While skeptics might dismiss the agreement as symbolic, a closer inspection reveals an important victory for investor rights, transparency, and accountability in the financial sector. At the heart of this case was the assertion that BlackRock had violated Tennessee’s Trade Practices Act (TCPA) by failing to adequately disclose the role of ESG factors in its decision-making processes. ESG investing has been a polarizing topic, with proponents hailing it as a forward-thinking approach to sustainable finance and critics decrying it as a distraction from fiduciary duties. The lawsuit filed by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti aimed to address these tensions, arguing that investors deserved clarity and honesty about the criteria shaping their portfolios. This agreement serves as a blueprint for restoring trust in financial institutions. By addressing the controversies surrounding ESG investing, the settlement strikes a balance between innovation and accountability. It neither demonizes ESG principles nor gives them free rein; instead, it holds fund managers to their core responsibility—maximizing shareholder value. Furthermore, the settlement demonstrates the power of state-level legal actions to influence corporate governance on a national scale. As more states scrutinize the practices of financial giants, the message is clear: investors deserve honesty, transparency, and accountability. Some critics may argue that the settlement lets BlackRock off the hook by dismissing the claims without prejudice. However, this overlooks the significant commitments BlackRock has made to reform its practices. The settlement includes clear mechanisms for reasserting the dismissed claims if BlackRock fails to comply, ensuring that the agreement has teeth. Moreover, by requiring BlackRock to implement these reforms over three years, the settlement allows for meaningful, lasting changes rather than short-term fixes. The inclusion of audits and public disclosures further bolsters its enforceability. In an era where ESG controversies dominate headlines, this settlement offers a refreshing approach. It empowers investors with the information they need to make informed decisions while holding financial institutions accountable for their actions. As other states consider similar measures, Tennessee has set a precedent that balances innovation with investor protection. While no settlement is perfect, this agreement represents a significant victory for transparency, accountability, and the integrity of financial markets. For Tennessee investors—and indeed, all investors across the country—it’s a step in the right direction. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Since forever, ESG has contravened bedrock fiduciary responsibilities very clearly and deeply established by both statutory and common law. Blackrock had no choice but to fold. The three years compliance monitoring adds a nice touch. Nice that ‘we’ are finally getting some wins, as here. Some recent notable others: The NZBA just folded. 47 had promised to go after it on anticompetitive grounds. The most recent ridiculous NYC climate lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice.

Title: BlackRock, Tennessee settle lawsuit over firm’s ‘misleading’ ESG strategy

BlackRock and the state of Tennessee on Friday reached a settlement over a lawsuit claiming the asset management firm downplayed how large a role environmental, social and governance proposals made in its investment process. The settlement is another win for red states that have launched attacks against companies with ESG goals — including DEI initiatives, a subsect which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion – claiming the proposals are counteractive to shareholder interest. “BlackRock’s stringent obligations under this settlement ensure Tennesseans will not see their retirement funds used to support radical ideologies they oppose,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. Under the settlement, BlackRock will be subject to increased transparency, regular audits, compliance trainings, cooperation with the attorney general, improved investor communications and a commitment to financial interests. The suit – which was filed in 2023 by the state of Tennessee – accused BlackRock of making “misleading” statements on how strongly ESG proposals steered its investments. BlackRock has dismissed the claim, arguing it accurately discloses its investment practices. “We’re pleased to resolve this matter,” a BlackRock spokesperson told The Post in a statement. “BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices.” The settlement did not result in a penalty, fine or admission of wrongdoing on BlackRock’s part. Last week, a federal judge ruled that American Airlines violated federal law by allowing its 401(k) manager BlackRock to weigh ESG factors in its investments. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Northern District of Texas said the air carrier violated its fiduciary duty of loyalty. Friday’s settlement could be an indicator for other cases involved in the Republican-led war against ESG investing. A coalition of 11 states led by Texas slapped BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. with a lawsuit in November accusing the firms of operating as an “investment cartel.” The suit accused the asset managers of colluding to acquire stakes in coal producers and then push ESG goals – which hurt coal production, sent electricity costs up and increased profits for the firm. BlackRock has dismissed the suit as “baseless” claims that go against “common sense.” “The suggestion that BlackRock has invested money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense,” the company previously said.

Title: Mitek Systems, Inc. (MITK): AI Identity Verification Solutions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MITK) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Additional offerings include ID_CLOUD, IDLive Face, IDLive Doc, and IDVoice to combat fraud and better security. The company aims to strengthen its AI-powered solutions and upgrade fraud and identity detection to tackle rising digital fraud. The company not only has AI-driven solutions but is also focused on combating rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. At its latest earnings call, the company CEO Ed West said: “Mitek (NASDAQ:MITK) is a trusted leader in computer vision and identity-related application of AI and fraud prevention. We revolutionized check processing with our mobile check deposit solution and we continue to push boundaries with innovations in identity verification, authentication and fraud management” He also added: “Customers are increasingly seeking integrated platforms, not just point solutions, to combat rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. Our fraud platform stands out with proprietary capabilities with an established track record of leading in trusted third-party and U.S. government-led benchmarks. In December, Allen Klee of Maxim Group maintained a Buy rating on Mitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) with a $13 price target, emphasizing its strong financial performance and strategic focus. The company outperformed expectations in F4Q24, achieving significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and EPS growth, driven by strong results in its Identity and Deposits segments. Overall, MITK ranks 22nd on our list of the 59 AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of MITK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MITK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By Niket Nishant and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to new disclosure requirements about its use of sustainable-investment factors as part of a legal settlement with Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, his office said on Friday. The resolution is the latest step by New York-based BlackRock and by other firms to move away from environmental, social or governance measures. An anti-ESG backlash has gathered force among Skrmetti and other Republican politicians including incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Skrmetti sued BlackRock late in 2023, alleging it did not adequately disclose its use of ESG factors and that it overstated their financial benefits. Although BlackRock did not admit to wrongdoing or pay fines as part of the deal, Skrmetti told Reuters in an interview that the agreement was significant as a mark of the times. "BlackRock was at the heart of this, the biggest asset manager in the world, and their willingness to undertake this settlement speaks to the end of the ESG moment," he said. The company's steps like quitting an investor climate group on Jan. 9 "certainly helped solidify" the agreement, he said. BlackRock, with some $11.6 trillion under management, said it was pleased to resolve the dispute with Tennessee. "BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices," the company said in a statement sent by a representative. Among other things, BlackRock agreed to disclosure requirements such as giving quarterly, not annual, details about votes it cast, and to provide a rationale when its non-ESG funds cast proxy votes against management recommendations on environmental or social matters. BlackRock already provides many such details on its website. Skrmetti said the formalization of the disclosures creates a "comprehensive compliance regime" and that the lack of financial penalties helped speed the deal. ESG investing enjoyed a run as a hot area of finance but investors pulled back in recent years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine surged energy prices and hurt the relative performance of technology-heavy ESG funds that often avoid fossil fuel stocks. Meanwhile Republicans, often from energy-producing states, have increased pressure on BlackRock and rivals like Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) over the issue. Fink said in 2023 that he had stopped using the term ESG as it had become too politicized.

Title: Vanguard fined more than $100 million by SEC over violations involving target date retirement funds

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Asset management giant Vanguard has been fined more than $100 million to settle charges related to disclosures around target date investment funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday. The alleged violations stem from a 2020 change where Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirement for its institutional target date funds. The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. “The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments,” the SEC said in a press release. The fine of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the fine without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of last November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. “Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We’re pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options,” Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The fine highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order. Normally, target date funds remain in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts — which would avoid a tax hit from a large capital gains distribution. The SEC’s order said Vanguard’s investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. The fine announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020. The alleged violations took place under former CEO Tim Buckley. The current CEO, Salim Ramji, joined Vanguard from BlackRock in 2024. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: T Stamp Inc. (IDAI): AI Identity Verification Under $2 Billion Market Cap

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T Stamp Inc. (NASDAQ:IDAI) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:IDAI) specializes in identity authentication solutions for government, enterprise, and peer-to-peer markets globally. The company uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, biometrics, cryptography, and data mining to detect and prevent identity fraud, safeguard sensitive data, and improve digital service accessibility. Its technology combines Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token and various biometric or identifying data sources. On January 6, T Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) announced a strategic partnership with Qenta Inc. As part of the agreement, Qenta is spinning off its Goldstar KYC technology into a new subsidiary, QID Technologies LLC, with Trust Stamp holding a 10% stake in the new entity. Trust Stamp has also granted QID a non-exclusive license for its AI-powered identity technologies in exchange for a $1 million license fee, payable in three installments over Q1 2025. Additionally, QID will contract with Trust Stamp for business and product development services related to identity and privacy solutions, with monthly service fees starting January 1, 2025, capped at $3.6 million annually. As a 10% shareholder in QID, Trust Stamp expects to receive a net cash inflow of $3.3 million from the projected $3.6 million in billed revenue. Overall, IDAI ranks 58th on our list of AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of IDAI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Traders Ditch Emerging Markets in Rocky Start of the Year

(Bloomberg) -- Investors are yanking money from emerging markets at the start of 2025 as they weigh how many of Donald Trump’s threats will become policy upon his return to the White House next week. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? Money managers pulled $8.5 billion from funds dedicated to developing-world stocks and bonds so far this year, according a JPMorgan Chase & Co. report citing EPFR data. The selloff has hit assets across the globe from Chile’s peso to stocks in China and India to sovereign bonds from Romania and El Salvador. The outflows mark the continuation of a trend that has beset the asset class for the past three years. Traders have already been struggling to make a case for emerging markets while the US economy hums along, the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts dims and some of the biggest developing economies, from China to Brazil, struggle. Trump’s inauguration on Monday poses a fresh set of risks. The Republican president-elect has doubled down on his proposal to impose sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world, while adding threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland. “It’s hard for the market to take big bets in front of big events,” said Pablo Goldberg, a portfolio manager at BlackRock in New York. “Markets don’t like uncertainty, and right now we’re still in a very uncertain period.” The start of the year has been bumpy, with an index of emerging stocks sinking into a correction in early January and dollar bonds posting losses. Most emerging currencies are down versus the dollar this year, with some including the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real trading at or near record lows as changing bets on US rate cuts and Trump policies boost the dollar. Asian central banks, which have been shielding their currencies through interventions in the face of the greenback’s relentless rally, are beginning to rethink their strategy, considering rate cuts to boost their economies instead of focusing on currency management. ‘Highly Uncertain’ Carlos Legaspy, chief executive officer at Insight Securities, said investors are opting for safety, at least until they see how the early days of Trump’s second presidency plays out. “I’d rather buy a a two-year Treasury with a yield near 4%,” he said, “then to wait and give Trump 100 days to see if he starts delivering on his threats.” Arif Joshi, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, said he’s expecting the changes in trade and tax policy to be significant during Trump’s second term. “The magnitude and timing of those changes are highly uncertain,” he said. “It’s not wise at this time to have duration or FX risk in emerging markets.” The Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Korean won are particularly vulnerable and could weaken as much as 10% should Trump impose single-sector tariffs, according to Barclays strategists led by Lefteris Farmakis. During the campaign, Trump floated minimum tariffs from 10% to 20% on all imported goods, and 60% or higher on China, causing a selloff in EM assets. He also caused a rout in Panama bonds when he suggested the US should reassert control of the canal — one of the most important waterways in the world — if the nation didn’t cut transit fees for American vessels. The unpredictable nature of the announcements — assets have posted harsh swings several times in the past two weeks amid Trump social media comments, including this Friday — has prompted Michael Cirami to instruct his junior staff to shout any time Trump mentions a country for the first time. “He could wake up in the middle of the night and mention a country that you were not expecting him to, and all of a sudden, the situation’s changed,” said Cirami, who helps manage $3 billion in mostly fixed-income assets at Artisan Partners. “We need to be on our guard.” --With assistance from Andras Gergely, Carolina Wilson, Selcuk Gokoluk, Winnie Hsu and Catherine Bosley.

The alleged violations stem from a 2020 change where Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirement for its institutional target date funds. The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. "The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," the SEC said in a press release. The payment of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. Vanguard is one of the world's largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. "Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We're pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options," Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The payment highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order. Normally, target date funds remain in tax-deferred accounts such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts — which would avoid a tax hit from a large capital gains distribution. The SEC's order said Vanguard's investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. Jeff DeMaso, who specializes in tracking Vanguard at Independent Vanguard Adviser, said he believed the $106 million settlement was the largest ever regulatory payment imposed on the Pennsylvania-based asset manager. The settlement announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020.

Spread the infestation! Ethereal Oracle Dev Comment: Ethereal Oracle has been one of the strongest and most ubiquitous cards in the meta since the launch of The Great Dark Beyond. In hindsight, this is a card we probably should have addressed in the last balance patch. Unfortunately, the timing of that patch wasn't ideal because we try to avoid high-impact changes heading into an extended winter break where we wouldn't be able to react to unforeseen problems that might arise. Instead, we're adding the change into this major patch because we're already expecting a meta shakeup with the mini-set, and we have our usual built-in balance window a few weeks from now for any necessary follow-up adjustments. Disenchantable versions of Ethereal Oracle will be eligible for full dust refunds for two weeks after this change goes live with Patch 31.4. Choose your faction and fight for glory! From January 21 - February 11 , pick one of three Event Tracks to complete for 13 packs (5 Perils in Paradise packs and 8 The Great Dark Beyond packs) and a faction-specific Hero Skin. Which campaign will you join? Event Hero skins not earned through the event will be available in the in-game Shop after the event ends. When Patch 31.4 launches, all current Arena runs will end and a new Arena season will begin. The Arena pool will be adjusted so that the following sets make up the card pool this season: Additionally, a new Arena-only card will be added to the card pool to help you probe the depths of the meta: Loaner decks for new and returning players* are getting updated with the launch of Patch 31.4. These new decks are tuned to let you immediately jump onto the ladder and include cards as new as The Great Dark Beyond main set! * Returning players who have been away for 90 or more days are eligible for a free deck just for logging in. Returning players can claim these returning decks each time they are eligible. New players are eligible for their free deck after completing the tutorial and Apprentice Track. On February 4 , the Wonders XL format will end and the Wonderful Un'Goro format will begin. Wonderful Un'Goro is back to a 30-card format using the Wonders format, but with Journey to Un'Goro added. The following sets will make up the format: The Wonderful Un'Goro format will end with the February season and then Twist will be on hiatus. We will have more information about future Twist seasons in a future update. As someone that loves Starcraft this miniset is something I look forward to how it turns out remains to be seen but just to be able to play with Starcraft cards will be awesome. Hopefully the meta will be better than what we have now because right now I hate the meta. The meta even if there is alot of decks present feels like it all plays the same its either combo or puke minions on board. Some decks combines the two like Handbuff Paladin that pukes minions for 8 turns than have a 25+ damage combo from hand. Really looking forward to this mini set! SC2 was the 1st blizzard game I've ever played and holds a special place in my heart. D4 Season 7 is on Tuesday too so I'm gonna have a good night of gaming. The price of the mini set is 2500 gold. Is it worth buying? Minisets is always worth buying, its so much value for just 2500 gold. WTB an update for BG's instead of this BS we currently have. Honestly, might as well throw Wayward Probe into the main game too because why not. I agree completely! have they showed the Grunty card yet Believe it’s tomorrow at 9am EST I love how Twist is seemingly being shelved just as quickly as it was introduced. "Here's a repeat season followed by another hiatus. We'll update you all later." Just admit you killed Duels for no reason and your replacement failed because of no actual effort. The season with the prebuilt decks for Legendaries was so fun but we haven't seen anything like it since. But hey, at least we have 1 game board a year now and 2 ultra premium Ragnaros skins. Yeah I think with their current staffing level, it’s taking all of Hearthstones workforce to keep standard/battlegrounds/arena running. solo adventures, twist, duels, mercenaries, and game boards are all getting shelved. There are a lot of new skins and pack bundles in the shops, which is likely because blizzard is forcing the team to focus on content that instantly generates money. I don’t blame the devs, because they’re underpaid engineers who also play the game and try their best, but I hope the upper echelons of blizzard make sure to prioritize gameplay a bit more often I feel that there was a bunch of better changes you could do to Ethereal Oracle rather than increasing the Cost. Because the design philosophy of most nerf feels to be "Maybe they would play it less" instead of "Let's make the card more balanced" You want to play your cards, every Priest plays Creation Protocol because why wouldn't you, but the card is perfectly fair. I don't really know in what deck the card was problematic cause I don't play standard. But recently I only saw it on Meteor Shaman, and if that deck was the problem you could say "Draw 2 spells that started in your deck" or remove the Spell Damage, or even give it Spell Damage -1 , Why not after 10 years I think we are ready for a change like that, but only increasing the Mana is like meh. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. But... that was exactly the problem with the card - it was too efficient, so a lot of decks used it. You didn't even have to plan to use the spell damage. The goal is to make it a bigger investment so that decks that don't need it stop using it by default - expanding deck diversity in the meta, so the decks that want Ethereal Oracle look more different from every other deck. Fundamentally, I just read this statement and hear you saying "I think the nerf will work". I mean, the card is nerfed, that's not debatable. What I mean with that statement is that you are hurting more the decks where that card was just fine, than the decks when the card was problematic. And is a clear case when the just pay for the sinners. For example (this was reverted but works for the point) At some point Saronite Chain Gang was nerfed to "Summon another Saronite Chain Gang" because back on the day the interaction that it had with Shudderwock was problematic. But that actually damaged all the other decks when you wanted to use Saronite Chain Gang as a handbuff card. So instead of make an smart change that fix the issue without removing the utility that it had for other decks. As simple as said "Battlecry: Summon another Saronite Chain Gang with stats equal to this minion's", they just removed that. So yeah, it fixed the Shudderwock problem, but all the other decks that cared for the card for a different reason also lost a card unjustifiably. So yeah, the card is going to see less play, but is going to see less play in the decks where it was less problematic At 4-Mana, if I don't care about the Spell Damage that much, I might just play Carry-On Grub which has better stats and an effect that you can play on curve without worry about anything, and without needing external cards to trigger it. Thing is people often missunderstand the intentions of nerfs, most of the time when they nerf a card the intention is not to kill it but to make it abit weaker and less efficient and even if its not alot a mana increase does make a card less efficient. This nerf will probably remove it from some decks but not the decks that use it as an important part of their win condition. A shame that they are not adding Wayward Probe to constructed too, since this is the last time any Starship support will ever be printed. A card like that would have been a fun addition to the Starship mechanic and what I would have expected to see in a miniset. I would probably bought a Overmind mythic skin. Damn shame it's Kerrigan. "Awaken my child and embrace the glory that is your birthright. Know that I am the Overmind the eternal will of the Swarm and that you have been created to serve me." Expected some more changes after such a long time lol And 1 aena-specific card? Weird Usually when you have such a meta warping card nerfed the meta changes quite a bit. This card will slow down a lot of the decks that use it. Cards that seem very strong now may not be in a week, plus with a mini set coming out they’ll probably have a bigger one in a few weeks and rotation is soon so they’ll likely buff a few cards before they rotate.

Mason Hawkins is a prominent figure in the world of value investing, best known as the founder and chairman of Southeastern Asset Management, an investment firm established in 1975. The firm began with a modest pool of assets but grew to manage approximately $20 billion within a few years.

Title: Legend Biotech Corporation (LEGN): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While 2024 was a “challenging” year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two. Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity. Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed’s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an “option-like structure” if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates. Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank’s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks. Flood’s note also highlighted that the biotech industry has recently shown improved fundamentals, attributed to a more favorable regulatory environment and positive clinical outcomes. Despite these tailwinds, Goldman’s data reflects that biotechnology remains under-owned by hedge funds. The sector ranked in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year. Furthermore, it ranked in the 4th percentile over the past five years. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of 40 biotech stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 15, 2025. We have also included the market capitalization of the stocks as of the same date. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds, as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory with workers in masks and lab coats focused on analyzing cell therapies. Analyst Upside: 161.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) is a clinical-stage company that develops, discovers, manufactures, and commercializes novel therapies for oncology and other indications. It develops advanced cell therapies across an elaborate range of technology platforms. The company operates in the US, China, and other geographical segments. It experienced solid sales growth for CARVYKTI® in fiscal Q3 2024. CARVYKTI treats multiple myeloma and is the first and only cell therapy that is clinically shown to significantly increase the overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. The company also increased its commercial capacity for the drug, delivering it to patients across the globe. It accounted for net trade sales of around $286 million in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting operational growth of 87.6% year-over-year and 53.2% quarter-over-quarter. Due to the drug’s transformational nature, Legend Biotech Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGN) recently initiated commercial production at its facility in Belgium to fulfill the demand for CARVYKTI worldwide. It plans to expand its capacity further while simultaneously advancing its R&D programs as part of its long-term strategy to be a leader in cell therapy innovation. TimesSquare Capital U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “We began buying shares in Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN), a biotechnology developer of cell therapies to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and leukemia. The European Union approved the use of Legend’s Carvykti treatment of multiple myeloma and later the FDA followed suit. Some investors may have been concerned about possible delays as Legend ramps up production, and its price declined. Though with a long-standing agreement with Johnson & Johnson and a new partnership with Novartis, we see a long runway of growth ahead, so we initiated a position.” Overall, LEGN ranks 2nd on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of biotech stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire victims’ return to their properties. “A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,” said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. “We’ve heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near homes — like those with power walls — for much longer.” The L.A. wildfires, which began Jan. 7, have taken at least 27 lives and destroyed thousands of homes. While the dry, dangerous winds are forecast to end — a lack of rain and another possible round of winds next week has kept officials concerned that the danger is not over. Estimates for insurance losses from the fires have rapidly jumped to as high as $40 billion and BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink has warned it could take a decade to rebuild the city. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already allocated $100 million to the cleanup effort. There were over 431,000 Teslas in operation in the Los Angeles area as of October 2024, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Based on new registrations, their market share locally was three times that of the rest of the nation. The Tesla Model Y was the biggest-selling vehicle in the state through September, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

People will be required to continue to pay their mortgages and property taxes even if their homes are ashes. This means a majority of the owners will lose their property which ultimately will be confiscated by the government or speculators who will obtain it from the banks and pay off the taxes. Suspect in the long run most of the property owners will have to absorb huge losses and simply move and start over. The weird envioros will get their way and much of the burned areas after the debris is cleared will return to wilderness.

But if everything around the EV is already burning, there's no value added from the special EV fire blankets. 16 posted on 01/17/2025 8:08:34 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Supreme Court Upholds TikTok Ban, App May Shut Down Jan. 19 in the U.S.

Trump says he needs 'time to review the situation' before deciding on next steps By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok could fade to black in the U.S. in a matter of days after the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to halt a law that will ban the popular video app as of Jan. 19 unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. “There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the Supreme Court wrote in its unanimous opinion in the case issued Friday morning. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.” Related Stories VIP+ A Decade of Data Supports Sports’ Domination of Broadcast TV The court said that “we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.” The Supreme Court affirmed the Dec. 6 judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the national security risks presented by TikTok’s Chinese ownership justified the divest-or-ban law. Popular on Variety In response to the ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump “for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.” ByteDance has not publicly indicated any willingness to sell its TikTok stake. TikTok has told employees that they will still have jobs regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In the event of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, TikTok has been planning to shut down the app in the U.S. on Sunday, Jan. 19. At that point, TikTok users will see a pop-up message linking to a site with information about the ban. TikTokers also will have the option to download their personal data. There still could be wiggle room for TikTok to avoid an immediate shutdown. The Biden administration is leaving the question of what to do about TikTok to Trump, set to be sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump, in a post Friday on Truth Social, wrote: “The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!” Trump is trying to position himself to be seen as TikTok’s savior: He is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of the law for 60-90 days while he tries to hammer out a resolution to keep TikTok available, as first reported by the Washington Post — although it’s questionable whether Trump has the legal authority to pause the divest-or-ban law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump may also instruct the government to not enforce the ban. But given that the law imposes fines of $5,000 per user on companies that distribute or host the TikTok app, tech companies like Apple, Google and Oracle (which has an agreement to host TikTok user data in the U.S.) may be reluctant to flout the ban. On Friday, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping and “discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!” Meanwhile, Trump has invited TikTok’s Chew to attend the incoming president’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., and to “sit in a position of honor on the dais,” per the New York Times. The shutdown of the TikTok app in the United States would be a boon to rival platforms including Meta’s Instagram, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat. Amid the looming threat of the TikTok ban, Chinese-owned social app Xiaohongshu (aka Red Note) has soared in popularity this past week. In May 2024, TikTok and ByteDance sued the U.S. government over the divest-or-ban law, arguing the legislation violates the First Amendment rights of its U.S. users. In addition, two groups of TikTok users and creators filed petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the law. But the Supreme Court sided with the law’s backers, who have claimed TikTok represents a national security threat because Beijing-based ByteDance is subject to oversight by the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance and TikTok have claimed the Chinese government has never requested access to TikTok user data — and that they would not turn it over if that were the case. The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that, according to the U.S. government, ByteDance “has previously declined to agree to stop collecting U.S. user data or sending that data to China to train the algorithm.” In addition, “The Government has further noted the difficulties associated with monitoring data sharing between ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc. … Under these circumstances, we find the Government’s data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions.” “Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age,” the Supreme Court said in its opinion. “But TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns.” American lawmakers who backed the legislation have claimed it is not technically a ban because it offers ByteDance a choice: to divest TikTok’s U.S. business or to have the app shut down. TikTok and ByteDance, in their lawsuit, argued that “in reality, there is no choice,” saying the forced divestiture required by the law in order for TikTok to be allowed to continue operating in the country “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.” Chinese officials reportedly have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Last year, the TikTok divest-or-ban legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support. It was signed into law by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have voiced concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda — despite providing no public evidence that the Chinese government has demand TikTok turn over user data or promote specific content. The law doesn’t mandate the shutdown of TikTok per se. Rather, it prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. (under penalty of monetary fines) unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to an entity based in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Could be cheaper than funding Ukraine's defense. (Excerpt) Read more at newsmax.com ... Naw, forget that. Let Joe buy it with the kickbacks he got while giving them our tax dollars. It is just stupid journalistic mal practice We already paid for it Yeah, like we need another Kalifornia. Which one is more corrupt? The only different between Kalifornia and Ukeland is one is filled with commies and the other Nazis. The Neocons ‘bought Ukraine’ when they overthrew its elected government in 2014. So far the price is at $300B and climbing. At this point it’s best to cut our losses and let Europe deal with that failed country. We,(the west) already bought Ukraine and it is more useful for people to not know about it. Well, Russia knows about it. As you can see. LOL I prefer Greenland. It would make more sense to merge Ukraine and Poland. Not that that makes sense. Any outcome that puts NATO at Russia‘s doorstep does not work for Russia. Oh. We’ve already paid for Ukraine Your archaic thought is irrelevant in the present Bidenskyyyyyyyyyyy already bought it, about 12 times. Too late, Larry Fink has the exclusive rights already. “Your archaic thought is irrelevant in the present” You’re right, the REAL COST of the Neocon disaster in Ukraine will be far more relevant in the future as the US finds that their only ‘friends’ are the economic basket cases in Europe. Likely to be the DUMBEST MOVE in American history, and that’s saying a lot. My kids and grandkids will pay a HUGE PRICE for their f-up. Eff that. This is styupid on every level imaginable. You can’t buy when Putin isn’t selling especially not to the leading tool of the globohomp empire, Biden’s Amerka. It creates a huge geo-strategic vulnerability and locks us into an Asian forever land war rather then shore up our security. Can we just take care of the citizens of the US. +1000. All the friends we cannot afford. The US is in debt seven times its national income, our currency is failing, and Republicans (even) want to go on a spending spree and buy up parts of the world. Fools, pay your bills or die! This odd article is an attempt at humor, I guess. It has value for one reason only. I learned a new word. From the article: “And, maybe, trade them California as a lagniappe.” Lagniappe: An extra or unexpected gift or benefit. This is not prudent. Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard plus some other European hedge funds would ask too high a price for their already-paid for shares. Besides we don't generally do "public domain" acquisition of private investor properties and contracts. Leave it be. Let Larry Fink and his chums raise his flag over the "capital" which he's committed to capitalize..... This is not prudent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by SunderRei. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on SERV. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV)'s share was trading at $18.88 as of Jan 16th. Logistics robots filling packages in a warehouse, preparing for delivery. Serve Robotics (SERV) has captured significant attention with its autonomous delivery robots, yet the company’s financials raise major red flags. Despite a market valuation exceeding $1 billion, SERV's history of unprofitability, negative gross margins, and high operational costs suggests an unsustainable business model. Each robot currently costs more to produce and operate than the revenue it generates, undermining the company's long-term viability. Alarmingly, SERV plans to mass-produce 2,000 third-generation robots in 2025, a 20-fold increase from its existing fleet of 100. With production costs per robot exceeding $32,000, this initiative will exert enormous financial pressure on a company already struggling to demonstrate profitability. The revenue potential per robot is concerningly low. Based on SEC filings, second-generation robots generate an average of $7,612 annually in delivery revenue, which pales in comparison to their production cost of $63,654. Even with the reduced production costs of third-generation robots and projected improvements in efficiency, it would still take six years for a robot to recoup its manufacturing cost—well beyond the likely operational lifespan. Operational expenses, including remote control staffing (required 20% of the time) and maintenance, further erode profitability, with annual costs per robot conservatively estimated at over $18,000. Advertisement revenue, a secondary income stream, offers limited relief. Even with an optimistic projection of $800 per robot per month, total revenues remain insufficient to offset the heavy expenses. SERV’s reliance on NVIDIA as a strategic investor has driven speculative interest, particularly following NVIDIA’s $12 million investment and 10% ownership stake. However, NVIDIA’s involvement appears more focused on showcasing its AI hardware capabilities than on SERV’s financial success. NVIDIA’s endorsement has inflated SERV’s valuation, which skyrocketed 2,000% in mid-2024, but it fails to address the fundamental flaws in SERV’s business model. Looking ahead, SERV's planned expansion is likely to exacerbate financial losses, with ballooning costs far outpacing revenues. Recent insider sales totaling $3 million further signal declining confidence among management. While SERV remains a speculative play for optimists betting on autonomous delivery technology, its current valuation is disconnected from its financial reality. For investors, SERV presents an overvalued stock with significant downside risk, making it a compelling short opportunity as its financial struggles become increasingly apparent in future reports. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 5 hedge fund portfolios held SERV at the end of the third quarter which was 3 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SERV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SERV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 'Drill, Baby, Drill,' Yet Time To 'Chill, Baby, Chill' on Lower Prices

The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.
