Title: ‘Ulster will be a huge test’: Leinster’s Tommy O’Brien on Saturday’s URC match and his international hopes

Conversations with Leinster’s Tommy O’Brien invariably alight on a former life as a schools 110-metre hurdles champion in Leinster and runner-up at national level. He also ran the 400-metre hurdles, highlighting how he possessed the fast-twitch fibres of a sprinter but also the stamina and endurance for the one-lap event. It’s not his doing. Invariably he’s redirected from rugby to athletics. Sitting in UCD, the topic arose again, but this time with a twist. O’Brien was asked about Sarah Healy, the 3,000-metre European Indoor gold medal winner with whom he ran alongside for a time at Blackrock Athletic Club, Co Dublin. “[Sarah is a] couple of years younger, the same age group as my sister. She was always incredible. I don’t think she lost an All-Ireland cross-country race from the age of 12 up. We always knew she was special, and she had an unbelievable work ethic. She had been running great times earlier in the year and now she has that European gold, which is incredible,” he said. “She has gone on to do fantastic things. When I got older there weren’t too many in my age group, so I moved over to DSD [Dundrum South Dublin AC] for my last few years of school. A lot of it would have been through school. My dad [Michael] would have coached in Blackrock AC.” O’Brien’s first love was rugby, a sport at which he excelled first as a centre in Blackrock College, then as captain of the Ireland under-20s, where he also played on the wing. The 26-year-old has been unlucky with injuries and it’s hardly a stretch to suggest that without one or two that were particularly ill-timed he’d have a couple of Ireland caps. He’s highly regarded by the national coaching team and would have travelled on the most recent Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa but for injury. Compensation of sorts came when Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby called him into the training panel during the recent Six Nations. “Any rugby player growing up always dreams of playing for Ireland, so that’s definitely an ambition of mine. I would have set that out at the start of the year,” O’Brien said. “I would have been frustrated at missing that Emerging Ireland tour at the start of the year because of injury, [but] managed to play a few games recently and got called into camp, got my first taste of it during the Six Nations. I would love to play in the summer [when Ireland play Tests against Georgia and Portugal], but the way you do that is playing and impressing for Leinster.” So, what did he learn in his brief time with Ireland? “It was very interesting in the speed and the amount of detail, but there were a lot of familiar faces that I would know from here [at Leinster],” he said. “It wasn’t a daunting step up at all, but it was definitely great to get an insight, especially as it was France week, a massive week in there. It was great to see the intensity and the detail.” O’Brien’s performances since returning to Leinster colours in February have been top notch, characterised by some thunderous tackling as Sharks player Makazole Mapimpi and Harri Millard of Cardiff will attest, and the value he adds on the ball, including a try in the province’s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over the Glasgow Warriors. Competition is fierce, and O’Brien knows that Saturday’s URC clash with Ulster at the Aviva Stadium, Dublin, is another opportunity to put a down payment on a place in a European semi-final against the Northampton Saints next month. “It is great that they are picking guys based on form. People like Max [Deegan] have gone really well in the last few weeks and he got his chance there [against Glasgow] and I played a few games and got rewarded with playing last weekend as well,” O’Brien said. “Ulster is going to be a huge test. In an Interpro people are always up for that. It’s about putting your hand up. I feel like they [Ulster] have turned a corner in the last few weeks when they had a great comeback win against the Stormers. “They went very well against Bordeaux, scored some great tries and they have a good few guys who have just come back from injury, especially in the backline. Their backs are humming again. They look like they are enjoying their rugby again and it will be a big test.” John O'Sullivan is an Irish Times sports writer Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Sea Shanty review: Quietly rewriting the rules of seafood in south Dublin

Some 20 years ago, I went to Barcelona for the first time. It was peak Celtic Tiger – and if you cared remotely about food, it was the place to be. The city was mid-revolution: foams, spheres, deconstructions – but also the old guard, holding firm. Chief among them: Quimet i Quimet, a tapas bar in El Poble Sec, where suited businessmen crushed in shoulder to shoulder for vermouth and conservas – tins of zamburiñas and navajas, the canned seafood delicacies beloved by the Spanish, stacked like library books behind the bar. I think of that room as I flick through the “tinned fish” section of the menu at Sea Shanty. There are snails, mussels, sardines, octopus and pâtés, served straight in the tin with focaccia, gildas, olives and crisps. On the broader menu there are no starters, mains or desserts in the traditional sense – just a tight run of small plates, raw and cooked oysters and a short dessert list. It’s built for grazing, sharing, and drinking alongside, rather than trudging through a three-act structure. Sea Shanty, run by Sebastian Sainz from Uruguay and Elena Segura from Seville (the pair met while working at Las Tapas de Lola on Wexford Street), is tucked discreetly upstairs over Conway’s Bar in Blackrock. It is signposted with the sort of understatement that feels deliberate. The floorboards are dark wood, tables are simple, chairs vary in height and a long communal table with high stools anchors one end of the rather large room. The lights – strung casually across the ceiling, festival-style – feel somewhat out of place. We start with anchovies (€10). They arrive delicately arrayed on a plate with semi-dried tomatoes and a hint of ponzu, that citrus-soy sharpness that makes your molars tingle. The anchovies are salty but not aggressive, and the tomatoes add a soft, jammy sweetness that threads it all together. We follow with a tin of conservas – spicy sardines (€14.50) – which are a little let down by indifferent olives and focaccia. Then there are the oysters. Seven types, sourced directly from each producer with the kind of nerdy geographical precision usually reserved for terroir-obsessed winemakers – Woodstown Bay, Cooley, Killough Bay, Rossmore natives, DK Connemara, Achill and Cromane oysters – each bringing a different level of salinity. You can go purist – raw, briny, glistening – as we do, with a delicious Rossmore native (€3.70). Or you can opt for the lightly cooked versions. The green curry and spinach oyster (€4.50) tastes like a bowl of Thai curry gently caressing your mouth. There’s also a tempura oyster with wasabi mayo and asparagus (€4.50) in a gloriously light batter. Next, octopus (€14) – a single tentacle, grilled and placed on a slick of deep red muhammara. There’s pomegranate seed, mint, maybe even a whisper of walnut. It’s tender – genuinely tender – which is so often not the case. There’s a channelled wrack bhaji (€11), seaweed encased in crunchy batter served with a sauce that nods towards takeaway curry but with more refinement, bringing a minty, nigella-seeded note. From there the menu gets bolder. A calamari taco (€13) – long strips of squid, crispy-edged and salted – comes topped with a tomato salsa, red cabbage slaw and flecks of coriander and mint. It’s a messy mélange of sweetness, acidity and crunch. To drink? This is a low-intervention wine list built by people who care – short, sharp and quietly adventurous – more about interest and texture than labels. Almost everything is available by the glass, which means you can actually match food to wine without committing to a bottle. A Bodegas Barón Xixarito Manzanilla Pasada en Rama (€11.50), aged 10 years and bottled unfiltered from the cask, works brilliantly with the anchovies. A Veltlínske zelené (€10), a Slovak riff on Grüner Veltliner, is bright and mineral. And Claus Preisinger’s Kalkstein Blaufränkisch (€11.50) is light, low-alcohol and fruit-driven – elegant but not fragile. Dessert is mango with mascarpone and saffron syrup (€5.50). It arrives as a sort of whipped-sorbet hybrid – not quite mousse, not quite purée – layered with cream, mint and a drizzle of saffron that’s tastefully restrained. You can eat modestly at Sea Shanty – a glass of wine, a couple of oysters and a few plates – which is perfect for a catch-up with a pal. Or settle in, as we do, for a longer spell, chatting with Segura about the wines and working your way across the menu. Either way, it’s pleasurably satisfying – and likely to be even more so once they secure a permanent home. Dinner for two with three glasses of wine was €113.70. The verdict: Perfect for grazing, sharing and drinking alongside. Food provenance: Oysters direct from producers, Mungo Seaweed and Glenmar fish. Vegetarian options: Channelled wrack bhaji, fried cassava and mojo picon, and kurze curry ramen. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: Dire Straits and music from Conway’s bar downstairs.

Title: Hertz shares surge 50% after Bill Ackman's Pershing Square discloses a stake

Share prices of Hertz surged 56% after billionaire investor Bill Ackman's firm disclosed a stake in the car rental company. Pershing Square Capital Management said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had acquired 12.7 million shares valued at $46.5 million. Pershing Square owns 4.1% of Hertz, making it the third-largest investor after Knighthead Capital Management and BlackRock, according to LSEG data. CNBC reported on Wednesday that Pershing Square's purchase — which includes shares and swaps — took its Hertz holdings to about 19.8% Hertz shares closed 56.4% higher at $5.71 apiece on Wednesday and were up 33.8% in after-hours trade. The stock was little changed this year before Pershing Square's disclosure. Even though Hertz's gains on Wednesday were massive, the car rental company's stock isn't a stranger to such eye-watering jumps. In summer 2020, Hertz's shares surged over 800% in weeks after filing for pandemic-induced Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection — making it the original meme stock. It exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021 and started investing heavily in electric vehicles, including a plan to buy 100,000 Teslas. However, the company started backtracking on its EV plan due to the cost of maintenance and repairs for the cars. Used EV prices have also been falling sharply. Hertz was selling a significant number of its EVs by 2024 and was even asking customers if they wanted to buy the vehicles. The failed bet on EVs showed up in earnings. Vehicle depreciation cost Hertz a $1 billion non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter. Pershing Square did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment sent outside regular business hours. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Archer and United plan NYC air taxi service for airport trips

The company promises 5-15 minute trips between Manhattan and all the major airports. The company promises 5-15 minute trips between Manhattan and all the major airports. by Andrew J. Hawkins Archer says it will launch an air taxi service in New York City with United Airlines, which will include routes between Manhattan and major airports like JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark. The aviation company aims to replace hourlong taxi rides along congested roads with breezy flights lasting between 5-15 minutes. Archer and United would utilize preexisting helipads at East 34th Street, West 30th Street, and Lower Manhattan to launch its all-electric Midnight aircraft, which has space for four passengers and a pilot. Passengers would be able to travel from the helipads to all three major airports, as well as three smaller, regional hubs at Westchester County Airport, Teterboro Airport, and Republic Airport. Passengers would book air taxi trips as an “add on” to their existing flights — though the price is still to be determined. A one-way ride from Manhattan to JFK Airport on one of Blade’s helicopters typically cost around $265 per seat. The companies won’t say when they intend on launching an NYC air taxi service, but Archer has said its aircraft will make their commercial debut in Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympics. Before it can launch, Archer needs to obtain type certification for its Midnight air taxi, which means the aircraft meets all the FAA’s design and safety standards. The company has previously received Parts 135 and 145 certification for on-demand services and specialized repair. Midnight has a range of up to 100 miles (nearly 160km) at speeds of up to 150mph (241 km/h), on pure battery power. Using tilt rotors, Midnight is designed to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then transition into forward flight like a plane. Archer came out of stealth in spring 2020 after having poached key talent from Wisk and Airbus’ Vahana project. The company has a $1 billion order from United Airlines for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, a $500 million deal with a Japan Airlines’ joint venture, and a deal to mass-produce with automaker Stellantis. The company also recently closed on several funding rounds giving it about $1 billion in liquidity. The company is also moving more into the defense space, with plans to next-gen military aircraft for Anduril Industries. This funding round included investments from Blackrock, Willington, and leading institutional developers, Archer says. Air taxis, sometimes misidentified by the mainstream media as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors (though they certainly have their own unique noise profile). In addition to Archer, companies like Joby Aviation, Volocopter, and Beta Technologies have claimed they are on the cusp of launching services that will eventually scale up nationwide. But others have floundered; German company Lilium recently said that two of its subsidiaries were insolvent and could cease operations.

Title: Here’s One Crypto Sector Quietly Going Parabolic Despite ‘Frustrating’ Bear Market, According to Bitwise

Crypto giant Bitwise says that parts of the digital asset ecosystem are experiencing “raging bull markets” despite underwhelming sentiment in the asset class at large. In a new Q1 report, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that “frustrating” would be the best word to describe the first quarter of 2025, but that it was still “historically positive.” Hougan notes that on top of surging stablecoin adoption and Bitcoin futures trading volume, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) went parabolic in Q1. “What caught my eye is that, despite the pullback in prices, parts of the crypto market are experiencing raging bull markets. For instance: Stablecoins AUM (assets under management) surged to an all-time high of over $218 billion, up 13.50% quarter-over-quarter. Transaction volume also surged 30.14%. Tokenized real-world assets went parabolic in Q1, growing 37.07% quarter-over-quarter to a new all-time high. Regulated bitcoin futures trading volume and open interest also hit all-time highs, suggesting institutional interest in crypto as a macro trading asset is growing. As we move into Q2, I would expect these and related areas to lead the market higher.” Bitwise’s data shows an explosive uptrend for RWAs over the last several years, one that has accelerated in 2025 so far, largely driven by the tokenization of private credit and US Treasuries. According to Bitwise, Ondo Finance (ONDO) rivals BlackRock for the tokenization of US Treasuries, and eclipses other traditional finance (TradFi) firms like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Bitwise also says that after years of tightening, central banks across the globe are signalling a pivot towards looser monetary conditions and an expansion of M2 money supply, which, historically, has been “been favorable for risk assets, particularly for digital assets.” Read the full report here.

Title: Ethereum Is What Bitcoin Was Meant to Be

Bitcoin was born as a response to institutional failure, a decentralized escape hatch from corruptible centralized finance and a north star of self sovereignty. Bitcoin’s true vision was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That phrase is right there in the Bitcoin white paper’s title from Satoshi himself. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Today, Bitcoin is many things: But Bitcoin is not electronic cash. It is too volatile for daily use, too slow to scale and too rigid to adapt as a cash equivalent. Somewhere along the way, Bitcoin gave up on being the system, and instead became the signal. Ethereum, by contrast, might be the one actually delivering on Bitcoin’s original promise. Thanks to Ethereum’s programmability, we now have stablecoins, arguably the most successful crypto use case to date. Dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT settle trillions in peer-to-peer value across borders 24/7 with no bank intermediaries. Stablecoins are Bitcoin’s white paper come to life, minus the volatility. Ethereum’s scale can be shown through on-chain data. Stablecoins on Ethereum and its Layer 2s now rival the transaction volume of major credit and debit card networks. In markets where local currencies are unstable or financial access is limited, stablecoins have become lifelines. They are used for remittances, payroll, savings and even commerce. The irony is that Bitcoin wanted to replace fiat, but it’s Ethereum that has quietly made fiat better. It gave the dollar superpowers like composability, programmability and global mobility. And it’s doing it without centralized permission. Here’s the kicker: Ethereum’s evolution doesn’t stop at payments. Once you understand the technology, you realize ETH does everything BTC can do, and so much more. Where Bitcoin remains focused on scarcity, Ethereum is building infrastructure. The rise of real-world asset tokenization (RWAs) is a perfect example. Treasury bills, private credit and fund shares are now being issued on Ethereum, bringing regulated assets into composable finance. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other legacy giants aren’t launching on Bitcoin; they’re building on Ethereum. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin’s inert capital, Ethereum enables native yield through staking, allowing participants to secure the network while earning predictable returns — an increasingly attractive feature for institutions seeking on-chain cash flow. This isn’t to say Bitcoin has failed. It serves a different role: a monetary anchor in the digital world. But its utility is limited. Ethereum, on the other hand, is becoming the global settlement layer for on-chain assets. While Bitcoin adoption has captured mainstream headlines, Ethereum’s fundamentals quietly continue to grow as the platform gains institutional market share. Some metrics to back up Ethereum’s growing influence and usage include: Ethereum isn’t replacing Bitcoin. But it’s fulfilling what Bitcoin started: a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust — in short, digital cash. Bitcoin sparked the movement. But Ethereum is scaling it. For further information, please click here to view Advantage Blockchain’s last quarterly report.

Title: The Silent Invasion of Panama? Trump Said that the US Would Reclaim the Panama Canal
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/silent-invasion-panama-trump-said-us-reclaim-panama-canal/5884509
Time Published: 2025-04-16T15:14:19Z
Full Content:
In early April, Defense News reported that the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was going to Panama to speak to its leadership and discuss the situation with the Panama Canal concerning China, “Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week, the second senior U.S. official to visit the country in as many months, as President Donald Trump says America is “reclaiming” the country’s eponymous canal.” US aggression in Panama is following a blueprint to reclaim its “backyard” since China is wining influence and trade among Latin American nations. This is an insult to Panama, in fact, it’s an imperialist move that signifies that the Trump regime does not respect the sovereignty of the Panamanian people. This brings back the horrible memories of the US invasion of Panama on December 20, 1989 that resulted in hundreds, some estimates say, thousands of people dead. “While there, Hegseth will meet with the country’s president, Jose Raul Mulino, and attend a meeting of regional chiefs of defense. He will also visit military sites and the Panama Canal itself.” This is alarming not only to Panama, but to other Latin American nations on Washington’s list for regime change including Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The report said that “In a statement Friday, Pentagon Press Secretary Sean Parnell wrote the meetings “will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere.” The mainstream media including Trump’s cheerleaders, Fox news and Newsmax, has been rather silent about these developments, according to Defense News, “The U.S. has a small military presence in Panama, though the Pentagon has reportedly been planning options to increase that number, in line with the president’s goal to take control of the canal. America is currently participating in a military exercise inside the country“ continued, “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in a March address to Congress.” Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino originally rejected Trump’s claims, but it seems that somehow he was intimidated, “In a post on the social app X after Trump’s speech, Mulino said ownership of the canal wasn’t being transferred and that he and Rubio didn’t discuss the topic” Mulino said, “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” The US Department of Defense highlighted what Hegseth had said at the press conference, “The era of capitulating to coercion by the communist Chinese is over,” he continued, “[China’s] growing and adversarial control of strategic land and critical infrastructure in this hemisphere cannot and will not stand.” Hegseth had announced the “expanded partnership” with Panamanian Public Security Minister Frank Abrego. Hegseth said that “The Panama Canal is key terrain that must be secured by Panama, with America, and not China.” In other words, the US is now in control of the Panama Canal because there was never a “partnership.” The US treats Panama as a puppet state under the banner of democracy. Now it seems that President Mulino has reversed his stance. Le Monde ‘Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal, but no permanent bases’ reported that US troops would be occupying, not building new bases: US troops will be able to deploy a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP on Thursday, April 10, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and “other activities” “Other activities” means that the CIA will be using those occupied bases in Panama to conduct regime change operations in Latin America. Mulino did warn that Trump’s idea to have US-owned bases in Panama would ignite mass protests: Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be “unacceptable.” He warned Hegseth: “Do you want to create a mess, what we’ve put in place here would set the country on fire” In a Memorandum of Understanding, Hegseth and Abrego supposedly acknowledged that Panama “won” concessions, but who in their right mind would trust the US President and his neocon regime? In the watered-down “Memorandum of Understanding,” signed by Hegseth and Panama’s security chief Frank Abrego on Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama’s sovereignty – not a given following Trump’s refusal to rule out an invasion – and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump’s willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians In an important note, Le Monde mentioned how Trump allowed BlackRock, a deep state corporate entity to buy two ports for $19 billion which angered Beijing: The ports’ parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries – including its two on the Panama Canal – to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal However, Panama’s opposition describes what is happening as a ‘Camouflaged Invasion’ as reported by The Guardian: Panamanian opposition politicians have accused the US of launching a “camouflaged invasion” of the country, amid simmering discontent over the government’s handling of the diplomatic crisis. After a three-day visit by the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump appeared to confirm that US military personnel had been deployed to the Central American country on Thursday, telling reporters: “We’ve moved a lot of troops to Panama” Washington is clearly trying to reoccupy Panama under the radar which will not sit well with most Panamanians, “Hegseth said that the US would increase its military presence at three former US bases in the country to “secure the Panama canal from Chinese influence.” Since 1999, the US military exited Panama under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty that handed over the canal to Panamanian authorities, “Under the canal’s neutrality treaty, no foreign power can “maintain military forces, defense sites and military installations within its national territory”, and the US comments have prompted outrage in Panama.” Ricardo Lombana, the leader of the opposition Other Way Movement said that “This is a camouflaged invasion” and that its “an invasion without firing a shot, but with a cudgel and threats.” This is the case: the US has invaded Panama without media attention. The Trump regime is following in the footsteps of the former US President, William McKinley the imperialist who led the effort to get the US into a war with Spain in what is known as the Spanish–American War. McKinley expanded US territories with the annexation of Hawaii and led to the forced colonization of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines and American Samoa. The Panamanian people will reject this imperialist move by the Trump Whitehouse. I also agree with Panama’s President, Jose Raul Mulino, in what he originally said about the US having their own bases would “set the country on fire.” But having US military personal in already existing military bases can also set Panama on fire. Either way, it’s a bad situation for Panama, protests are guaranteed, and the world is watching closely. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Netflix Set To Kick Off Earnings Season Well Positioned As Wall Street Weighs Recession Risk
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/04/netflix-q1-2025-earnings-tariffs-wall-street-media-1236368789/

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Netflix unveils its first-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The report will kick off a rather momentous earnings season for media amid churning stock markets and recession jitters prompted by the Trump administration’s global tariffs. Traditionally the company that fires the starting gun for entertainment and tech numbers every three months, Netflix may be a calming place to start this time. As tariffs cast a pall across business sectors including media, the streaming giant may be Wall Street‘s top stock pick to weather the macroeconomic storm. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein calls it the “cleanest story” in media in the case of a U.S. or global recession. The company has little tariff exposure, sustainable 2025 growth, strong engagement data and has gotten to the other side of a round of price increases, which bug customers but enthuse profit-hungry investors. This will be the first quarter when Netflix doesn’t report subscriber numbers, but it has a number of other metrics to trumpet and has been solidly profitable for years, a claim most other streaming players can’t yet make. Watch on Deadline Netflix is only minimally exposed to advertising, which right now is ideal, after introducing a cheaper ad tier less than three years ago. A nascent business is less exposed as low consumer confidence, anticipated inflation and economic uncertainty have Wall Streeters warning of an advertising pullback. Advertising makes up a big chunk of revenue and profit at companies like Fox Corp., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery to Meta and Snap. The ad business was hit hard during the past two recessions and slow to recover, which left leaving the media landscape transformed. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” research firm MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent client note. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation towards connected TV and broader digital channels.” He see $45 billion in lost U.S. advertising spend versus current forecasts if GDP growth slows in 2025. To limit downside risk, the firm’s Michael Nathanson pinpoints Netflix and Alphabet as “offering compelling entry points.” The firm has “buy” recommendations on both, as well as on Disney, WBD and Meta. It has “hold” ratings on Fox, Paramount, Roku and Snap. But it also said it’s waiting to revise forecasts ahead of “further clarity during earnings calls.” It’s an understatement to say that CEO commentary over the next few weeks is highly anticipated. Beyond advertising, analysts fret about parks, which generate key revenue at Disney and Comcast, with the latter’s NBCUniversal division set to open Epic Universe in May. Nathanson notes that historical recessions (in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009) squeezed domestic parks. In the event of a recession, he predicted, Disney’s U.S. revenue would be several billion dollars below his estimates for both this year and next. Trump’s tariffs have angered U.S. allies. Airlines are sounding a cautionary note and analysts in that sector note dips in foreign travel to the U.S. in March from the year before. Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities think Epic Universe could provide a nice boost to the sector in trying times, along with new Disney cruise ships and a rise in per capital spending at Disney parks. That said, BofA has had to rethink its outlook. “Entering the year, we were bullish on the Media & Entertainment industry in part driven by a potential cycle of M&A, but this thesis has clearly not played out (and appears unlikely) given the current Administration’s unfavorable view of some companies in our coverage,” Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients. Media and entertainment, in a state of seemingly never-ending tumult, navigating Covid and then Hollywood talent strikes over the past few years, “now faces the economic uncertainty and market volatility created by the risk of tariffs.” BofA economists are not forecasting a recession but see a drag on growth that could bring the economy to the precipice. “While typical recession risk mainly impacts revenue, tariffs could lead to higher costs,” the analyst noted, in areas like raw materials for sets, or a loss of foreign tax incentives for production. She sees Netflix and Spotify as best-positioned in the field and preferred buys as both have nascent ad businesses and strong subscription models with “critical entertainment which historically performs well in a recession.” Oppenheimer’s Helfstein says that Netflix could be confronted with higher churn, weaker gross subscriber additions or subscribers trading down to cheaper plans given the deteriorating economic picture. Still, he says the firm sees “limited risk overall.” Citing a 2011 Stanford survey, he said consumers spend more time at home during economic hardship, and time spent watching TV increased during the last U.S. recession. (And we all remember the explosion of viewing and sign-ups in 2020.) Netflix is offering both secular growth, as it embarks on a new advertising revenue strategy among selective price increases, says David Joyce of Seaport Research, calling it “the best of both worlds as the low price points globally offer a great deal of value for the engagement levels – which is exhibited in good times and bad.” Generally, what makes Netflix and other streamers a “defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it’s likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget.” A monthly premium subscription is cheaper than a sporting event, a concert and even an Imax ticket. Although exhibitors also tend to benefit in economic downturns. He has a buy on the stock. The first quarter brought one of the company’s biggest hits ever, Adolescence, showing continued momentum after it blew past estimates to top 303 million subscribers as of the end of 2024. Loop Capital’s Alan Gould said the Ted Sarandos- and Greg Peters-led streamer should be among the most economically resilient companies in the current climate and least impacted by tariffs. For the first three months of 2025, Gould is forecasting $10.54 billion in revenue; operating income of $3 billion; net income of $2.456 billion; and diluted earnings per share of $5.63. Wall Street consensus is close at $10.51 billion of revenue; just under $3 billion in operating income; $2.473 million net profit; and EPS of $5.67, he noted, as per investment researcher VisibleAlpha. “Both we and the Street and us are expecting a small revenue, operating income and EPS beat. The quarter will benefit from about a half quarter of the price increase in the UCAN region and a month in the UK. As discussed in our March 24 report, here, engagement appears to have been up 5% for the quarter based on NFLX’s weekly Top 10 global titles in English, non-English, film and series,” Gould said in a report yesterday. “Engagement was down for the 4 weeks from late February to mid-March, coinciding with 1 month after the US price increase was fully in effect, but engagement has since bounced back the past 3 weeks.” Any and all financial metrics will be taking on increased significance when company reports after market close Thursday because – and this is big – it will be the first quarter ever Netflix won’t be revealing monthly subscriber numbers. That prospect freaked out analysts when it was floated last year although some say it has the benefit of tamping down some of the volatility around the stock, which can get buffeted subscriber numbers from quarter to quarter. Netflix has said that it will still provide that data in certain situations, like when it hits milestones. It also will likely continue characterizing growth in its ad-supported tier, using montly active users (MAUs) as the key metric, which is different from subscribers. Upbeat sentiment on the streamer accelerated this week after a WSJ report that the company’s top brass shared some ambitious goals at an annual business review with senior staff – namely, plans to achieve a $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue by 2030. The outlook included growth targets for ad sales – of $9 billion globally by 2030, and tripling operating income from $10 billion in 2024. The saga of tariffs – imposed under a Trump declared “national emergency” in foreign trade – has been fast-moving, hard to follow and value-destroying. On April 2, the administration announced sweeping tariffs targeting 60 countries with a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all remaining imports that had not been taxed already, calling it Liberation Day. Trump then announced hefty, additional reciprocal tariffs on most countries, tanking markets. He later walked those back to allow for negotiations. When China publicly chastised the administration, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. China quickly confirmed will cut back imports of Hollywood films, which could impact media company revenue. Last Friday, Trump suspended tariffs on electronics like iPhone and laptops from China – where most are made. But the administration also said it’s probing the “whole” tech supply chain, meaning products like chips and semiconductors may not be excluded from tariffs. He also has hinted yesterday that he might give tariff relief to certain automakers to give them more time to move production the U.S. Relief also might also extend to car components. Tariffs on a major trading partner, the European Union, will likely stay in place as negotiations appear to have stalled, according to a number of developments on Tuesday. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been putting out sometimes twice-daily updates on the tariff situation in recent weeks, said Tuesday that “the price impacts from this head-scratching tariff slate could result in demand destruction of 15%-20%” for new car purchases in the U.S. this year. That would add $100 million to automakers’ costs and raise the price of new cars by up to $15K. Automakers are a key advertising category. Trump’s goal is to move production back to the U.S., but that would take years after decades of globalization. “We reiterate the concept of a U.S. made car with all U.S. parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative” and not even possible now, Ives wrote. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson has also been among those pointing out that a shift by Apple from China-based iPhone production to American manufacturing for the device, which accounts for half of the tech giant’s revenue, would take decades. Given the uncertainty, companies are unlikely to commit capital based on protectionist policies that may not last beyond 2028, Nathanson said. Entertainment, unlike auto parts or lumber or liquor or shoes, is a service, not a good, so not subject to tariffs. Of the more than 300 CEOs surveyed in April by an industry group called Chief Executive that conducts monthly polls, 62% saw a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months – up from 48% who had that forecast in March. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during a recent interview that the U.S. may already be in a recession or getting close to one due to Trump’s tariffs. The tariff debate escalated as banks were out with quarterly numbers, the first sector to report each earnings season. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday the prospect of a recession has increased amid the uncertainties of a trade war alongside growing indications that economic global economic activity is slowing. Influential JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also said tariffs could spur inflation, weaker economic growth and, potentially, a recession. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.

Title: Bolt’s Ryan Breslow pins his hopes on a new app that takes on Coinbase, Zelle, and PayPal

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ryan Breslow is officially back. While the founder of one-click checkout company Bolt re-assumed its helm as CEO in March, Breslow is unveiling Wednesday a new “superapp” that he hopes will formally mark his return as the fintech’s leader. He describes the new product as “one-click crypto and everyday payments” in a single platform, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch. The controversial entrepreneur famously stepped down in January 2022 from the San Francisco-based company he started in 2014 after dropping out of Stanford. In recent years, Breslow has been the target of more than one investor lawsuit and faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow acknowledges that Bolt’s revenue has not been robust in recent years. But he hopes to change that with this new consumer app, which he ambitiously hopes will serve as “a centralized and personalized hub for financial services.” The app at once competes with a number of other companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase, payments platform Zelle, and PayPal. Its advantage, Breslow claims, is the ability to do what all these others do from one place via mobile. For example, the app will allow users to buy, sell, send, and receive major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Solana, and Polygon directly within the app. Users are provisioned an on-chain balance powered by Zero Hash and will be able to see their balance in real time, Breslow says. “I founded Bolt 11 years ago to build the easiest app to buy, sell, and send crypto. I believe this still hasn’t been done well in the marketplace. Today marks a significant day: the return of that original vision,” said Breslow. “We call it ‘Coinbase for the 99%’ who may not be the most technical, but still want to participate in the buying and selling of crypto.” (Bolt in 2022 paid $1.5 billion for cryptocurrency payments company Wyre. It started out as an “easy way to buy, sell, and send crypto” before pivoting to build one-click checkout first.) Breslow is also hoping to pick up where Zelle left off with the shutdown of its standalone app. With Bolt’s new offering, users can process peer payments “with just a single click” within its app. With Zelle, users can only send payments to peers through banking apps. On top of that, Bolt has partnered with Midland States Bank to now also offer a debit card that features a rewards program, including up to 3% direct cash back on eligible purchases and up to 7% in Love.com store credits. (Love.com is another startup founded by Breslow in 2023 that is focused on health and wellness. He remains its CEO.) As Bolt doesn’t offer banking services, users will have to transfer money from another bank account into this one to fund purchases with the debit card. And lastly, the new app also provides real-time order tracking for users — something other companies such as Klarna offer in their app, as well. The app is available today in iOS and will soon be available in the Google Play store. Once downloaded, users will be added to a waitlist with iOS users being the first to get off the waitlist. The new “superapp” was built within just six months, Breslow claims. Justin Grooms (Bolt’s president and former interim CEO) and Kartik Ramachandran (Bolt’s chief product officer) began work on the app before Breslow was reinstated. Breslow helped advise them during the months prior to his reinstatement. “Our team has been working nights and weekends to get this ready in time,” Breslow said. Presently, Bolt has about 140 employees. Despite lackluster revenue growth, Breslow claims that Bolt has managed to still grow in terms of users — with a two-sided network of tens of millions of U.S. shoppers and “hundreds” of merchants such as Revolve and Kendra Scott. Bolt’s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year. “Prior to my return, our revenue did not grow much and we haven’t closed as much business as we’d like. We don’t think the company was run as well as it could have been. And that’s something I’m going to change very quickly,” Breslow told TechCrunch. “However, our platform kept on enrolling shoppers and attracting network growth. When I left, it was at 10 million. Now our total shopper network is 80 million in the U.S. and even larger globally.” He’s hoping to turn that network into revenue for Bolt by earning money from interchange fees for every debit card transaction and charging fees for the purchase and sale of crypto. “We already have a large trove of data users have provided that has been verified and charged successfully,” he said. The fintech company last year was reportedly trying to raise $450 million in an unusually structured deal that would have valued it at $14 billion. That deal raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in “marketing credits” and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead. Some of Bolt’s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that was voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced in March. Today, Bolt is in “early conversations” on a new round that Breslow projects could close “in the mid to near future.” Breslow was also previously sued by former investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan that the founder had taken out. Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back. The case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant’s shares for $37 million last year. Speaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas in March, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was. “I’ve had a tremendous amount of decline over the last three years and have been winning back the trust of judges, investigators, and our team, so it’s been incredibly challenging, but it’s been a remarkable learning experience,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve learned more in these last three years than in the 10 years prior to that.” He added: “And even though it’s been challenging, I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us. I feel so grateful that our company has weathered the storm.” Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.

Title: Recession Fears Have Us In the Days of 'Bimodal Guidance'
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/recession-fears-have-us-in-the-days-of-bimodal-guidance-11715936
Time Published: 2025-04-16T12:58:57Z
Full Content:
There's guidance, and there's If There's a Recession Guidance. We got both from United Airlines (UAL) yesterday when the airline offered second-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) guidance—a range of $3.25 to $4.25 per share—and full-year adjusted EPS guidance for both a "stable environment" and a "recessionary environment" while swinging to a first-quarter profit. The midpoints of both outlooks, presented as ranges, are above Visible Alpha's current mean analyst estimates.) "The company's guidance is based on consensus market macroeconomic expectations," the company wrote. "However, a single consensus no longer exists, and therefore the company's expectation has become bimodal—either the U.S. economy will remain weaker but stable, or the U.S. may enter into a recession." United's decision illustrates the uncertainty faced by companies seeking to navigate a fast-changing trade environment. That uncertainty has prompted investors and analysts to wonder if companies will not only be cautious in issuing outlooks as they report quarterly results in the coming days and weeks—but whether they'll issue them at all. Companies "tend to shut down guidance amid uncertainty," Bank of America analysts said last week. There's some early data out there, though it's not particularly conclusive. FactSet in a Monday note said that 16 of the 23 S&P 500 companies to report results through April 10 had discussed guidance, with 14 of those giving out some numbers for the 2025 or 2026 fiscal years. Two, meanwhile, pulled back previous guidance. One had a straightforward reason: Walgreens (WBA) is being acquired. The other was another airline. Delta Air Lines (DAL) gave out an outlook for the current quarter, but chose not to give out full-year guidance, saying in a statement that "given the lack of economic clarity, it is premature at this time to provide an updated full-year outlook." Other companies that have lately withdrawn their own guidance include Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC), the parent company of the airline with the same name, and Logitech (LOGI), the electronics maker. "We're in uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian recently said. Major U.S. airlines have broadly offered caution about 2025 in past months. United, meanwhile, isn't alone in dropping the "R Word." Larry Fink, CEO of asset manager BlackRock (BLK), recently said he's spoken with a number of chief executives who think the U.S. is already in a recession. Some big banks have raised their estimated odds of one soon. And on some betting markets, the odds of one this year are seen as more likely than not. On PolyMarket, for example, the perceived chance of a recession in 2025 was recently 54%, lower than seen earlier this month. The Wall Street Journal’s survey of economists, released this weekend, pegged the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 45%.

Page Six can exclusively reveal the 2025 Time100 list. This year’s “Most Influential People in the World,” according to Time magazine contributors, include politicians, tech entrepreneurs and business moguls, as well as entertainment execs and stars. Time senior correspondent Brian Bennett nominated President Trump, arguing that “no other modern president has as forcefully grabbed control of the US government.” Fellow senior correspondent Alice Park chose “public health disrupter” and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who “is already having an outsized impact on US health care.” Simon Shuster, another senior correspondent, selected Tesla tycoon Elon Musk, noting that his “meteoric rise … has been punctuated by bouts of frenetic energy, which usually come over him when he takes on a new challenge.” Dropbox CEO Drew Houston named Mark Zuckerberg for having “the courage to bet boldly on the future,” as the Facebook co-founder “invested aggressively in virtual and augmented reality, later staking Meta’s identity on a vision others couldn’t yet see.” TV show creator Shonda Rhimes nominated “savvy streaming executive” Ted Sarandos, the CEO of Netflix, for being “fearlessly smart, fearlessly innovative [and] fearlessly truthful.” Actor Will Ferrell chose “Saturday Night Live” creator Lorne Michaels, who “cultivates new talent and gives [rising comedians] the ability to express [themselves] in ways [they] didn’t know were possible.” Filmmaker Rian Johnson selected actor Adrien Brody, who “has earned the ‘they don’t make ’em like that anymore’ seal.” Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Title: Engaging Women Investors To Reshape VC Funding For Female Founders

ByGeri Stengel ByGeri Stengel, Contributor. Investing in female-founded ventures offers women investors a powerful dual advantage: compelling ... More financial returns and the ability to foster meaningful societal impact. Leveraging her unique background in media, Catherine Gray is tackling the stark venture capital funding gap—where solely female-founded companies received just 2.1% of US VC in 2024. She sees it as a structural failure and a missed investment opportunity. Through her influential film, Show Her the Money, and the subsequent launch of the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund, she's demonstrating how, using storytelling and direct investment, women investors can work together to unlock the proven potential of women entrepreneurs and reshape the investment landscape for both profit and purpose. Catherine Gray wasn’t always immersed in the world of venture capital. For 15 years, she was a leading account executive in cable television advertising. She then left that role to become vice president of advertising at the first gay cable network. That move marked a turning point in her career. She would dedicate her work to projects that make a meaningful difference. Gray produced a film supporting same-sex marriage and saw how powerful storytelling can help drive real change. That experience now drives her work in venture investing, where she’s tackling the deep gender gap in venture capital. The numbers paint a stark picture: In 2024, companies founded solely by women received a mere 2.1% of all venture capital dollars in the U.S., according to Pitchbook. Teams with male and female founders secured 20.9%, while male-only teams received the vast majority at 77%. Gray saw not just a discrepancy but a missed opportunity. The persistent under investment in female-founded startups is a challenge and a significant lost opportunity for investors seeking strong returns. She believes investing in women-led businesses is not just a way to make a social impact but also a huge investment opportunity. Recognizing the need to educate and engage a wider audience, Gray returned to film making. She created Show Her the Money, raising $1 million for its production. The movie's goal wasn’t just to recognize the problem but to make investing in venture capital feel impactful and within reach of women investors by telling an engaging story. The film struck a chord. It became a catalyst, sparking a global movement. Due to high demand, what started as a planned 50-city tour ballooned to over 150 screenings worldwide, proving Gray’s thesis: Storytelling could ignite understanding and enthusiasm for changing the venture landscape. This momentum also led directly to her co-founding the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund, turning awareness into action. Understanding how women invest reveals why they are particularly well-suited for venture capital, an asset class poised for growth and impact. Research highlighted in the How Women (and Men) Invest in Startups* shows women are risk-astute investors. They recognize the importance of having a diversified portfolio by investing in different asset classes, such as private companies, and diversifying within the asset class. A long-term investment strategy can lead to more stable returns and lower costs, according to BlackRock. It takes time for an investment in a startup to reach its potential. This strategy aligns with women's tendency to invest for the long term. VC funds address practical considerations. Women often value investment guidance from financial advisors or the experienced partners managing a VC fund. When time is tight, like for most women, having professionals advising you on your investments can be a smart move. VCs do this for the investments they make. Many emerging manager funds also have lower minimums to encourage women to invest in this asset class. This makes the investing venture more accessible. Beyond delivering a return on their investment, women frequently prioritize investing in ways that make a positive social impact, according to How Women Invest’s research report. Catherine Gray echoes this, emphasizing that “venture capital uniquely allows investors to ‘vote with [their] money’ to support innovation that matters.” She notes the excitement of VC comes from meeting founders, gaining early access to groundbreaking ideas, and participating in building the future—blending wealth creation with tangible impact. Gray contrasts this with angel investing, suggesting VC funds offer built-in expertise, deal vetting, and inherent diversification, making the asset class feel less daunting and more aligned with the strategic, impact-oriented approach many women favor. Born directly from the momentum generated by the Show Her the Money film, the Silicon Valley Women Founders Fund represents Catherine Gray's commitment turned into tangible action. With a target of $100 million, the fund focuses on investing in pre-seed and seed-stage women-led technology companies across various sectors like FinTech and Climate Tech, ideally seeking innovations incorporating an AI component for efficiency. However, the fund aims to provide far more than just capital. Leveraging the corporate venture expertise of Gray’s partner, John Majeski (formerly with Dell, HP, and Lenovo), it offers portfolio companies a strategic advantage, helping them understand what large tech firms look for in acquisitions or partnerships. Majeski’s background is rooted in identifying and facilitating acquisitions for major technology companies, providing valuable insights into navigating the complexities of tech industry deal-making. This experience is crucial for startups looking to scale and achieve successful exits. He is also a producer of the movie.** The fund’s operational framework and investment strategy are also shaped by Joy Fairbanks, a partner with a strong background in institutional investing and launching accelerators. Fairbanks’s experience includes working with impact venture incubators and developing the structures for fund operations, including investor reporting, sourcing, and screening mechanisms. Her role involves not only vetting companies and conducting due diligence but also providing hands-on support through the fund’s venture studio, ensuring that portfolio companies receive comprehensive guidance. She is also an associate producer of the movie.** Their venture studio offers hands-on support in key areas like marketing, legal, and accounting—helping founders navigate the challenges that often stall early-stage startups. Just as important, the fund backs founders who share its values, placing as much weight on character as on innovative tech. True to its mission, 1% of the fund’s profits go to nonprofits that empower women and girls. This initiative reflects Gray’s hopeful outlook on today’s investment landscape. Where others see roadblocks, she sees openings to create meaningful change. She highlights the “great wealth transfer” as a pivotal moment—one where women are gaining unprecedented control over wealth and, with it, greater influence in venture capital and family office investments. It’s a moment ripe for funds like hers to thrive. Gray also sees her growing platform as a way to bring together women innovators from around the world. Her fund is just one part of the broader Show Her the Money movement, which includes an upcoming book, educational programs, and a potential docu-series—all focused on building a more inclusive and forward-thinking future. Investing in female-founded ventures offers a powerful dual advantage: compelling financial returns backed by data, and the ability to foster meaningful societal impact. Women investors and their allies can wield their investment power and shape an innovative economy that is more representative of society and their needs. * The author of this article company, Ventureneer, co-produced How Women (and Men) Invest in Women. ** The article was updated to provide more details about John Majeski’s involvement and to add Joy Fairbanks.

Title: Property prices up for the 18th month in a row, putting the squeeze on buyers

More new homes are needed to satisfy demand from first-time buyers. Photo: AP Property prices are likely to have risen for the 18th month in a row, piling pressure on buyers trying to secure their first home. Prices were up by 8pc in the 12 months to February. This is down from 8.2pc in the year to January, according to Central Statistics Office (CSO) data for February. More new homes are needed to satisfy demand from first-time buyers. Photo: AP Today's News in 90 seconds - 16th April 2025 Property prices in Dublin rose by 7.1pc, and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7pc compared with February last year. The median price of a dwelling purchased in the 12 months to February was €360,000. The highest median price for a dwelling in February was €670,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €185,000 in Leitrim. The most expensive eircode area was A94, which is Blackrock, Co Dublin, with a median price of €747,750 Castlerea, Co Roscommon, where the eircode is F45, had the least expensive price of €148,000. Independent economist Austin Hughes said there are signs of slightly calmer conditions in the CSO data. “The February increase of 8pc is still strong and the pull-back is limited, but Irish house price inflation has eased now for six months in a row, having accelerated for the previous twelve months,” he said. “There is also a slight increase in transactions in the first two months of the year." Mr Hughes said a threatening global outlook, increased uncertainty about jobs and earnings in the multinational sector and broader affordability strains mean house price inflation should continue to soften through 2025. “However, further cuts in interest rates and a continuing shortfall in supply mean that we are likely to see a slowdown but not a slump in Irish property price inflation,” he said. In February, 3,245 dwelling purchases by households were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.4bn. These purchases were made up of 2,645 existing dwellings and 600 new dwellings. Revenue data shows there were 1,195 first-time buyer purchases in February, an increase of 2.8pc on the 1,162 recorded in February last year. These purchases were made up of 366 new dwellings and 829 existing dwellings. The national index has now reached the value of 191.9, which is 17.3pc above its highest level at the peak of the property boom in April 2007. Dublin residential property prices are 4.4pc higher than their February 2007 peak. Prices in the rest of Ireland are 18.8pc higher than their May 2007 peak. Property prices nationally have increased by 161.6pc from their trough in early 2013. Dublin residential property prices have risen by 158.5pc from their February 2012 low. Prices in the rest of Ireland are 173.3pc higher than at the trough, which was in May 2013. The surge in prices is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers who are struggling to secure a property with a very limited supply for sale. A survey this month found that surging house prices have prompted large numbers of younger people to ditch their plans to buy a private home and instead apply for social housing. The dream of their own place is fading for people in their 20s and 30s as they are struggling to save for a deposit, despite large numbers getting help from parents. Most people surveyed are worried that property prices will continue to rise, squeezing more and more younger buyers out of the market, according to the latest PTSB “Reflecting Ireland” research. Almost half of people who are in the market to buy a home are now considering applying for social housing, according to a survey carried out by Core Research for PTSB. When it comes to those between the ages of 18 and 24, a total of 61pc say they will apply for social housing instead of trying to buy a home. Surging prices caused by a chronic deficit of new homes under construction are causing younger people to abandon their home ownership plans.

Title: The Death of ESG

Some have proclaimed ESG investing dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? Over the past few years, ESG investing has moved from a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world to a polarizing topic. Financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net-zero initiatives, and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? The pushback to ESG gained steam in 2021, when Texas passed Senate Bill 13, an anti-ESG law. It prohibits any government entity in the state from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting — as defined by Texas — the oil and gas industry. The resulting “blacklist” of companies deemed to be discriminating against oil and gas included financial firm BlackRock — which, ironically, invests billions of dollars in energy companies in Texas. Since then, legislators across the country have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills — some modeled after the 2021 Texas law — in 40 states, according to a legislative tracker maintained by climate research firm Pleiades Strategy. It’s not just politicians going after ESG. Behind this flurry of legislation lies a tangled web of different interests that have supported the plot to kill ESG: think tanks, state treasurers, oil and gas trade associations, culture warriors, and oil tycoons. In this episode – our ESG whodunit – we take out our magnifying glasses to take a closer look at the legislation that would spark dozens of other bills across the country. We’ll question a line-up of suspects at the center of the anti-ESG plot and dive into their motivations for protecting the fossil fuel industry.

Amy Scott: So how would you describe the smell? Elizabeth Trovall: It is, we haven't even gotten to the worst of it. Amy Scott: I'm on the bow of the Sam Houston, an elegant 95 foot boat with the breeze in my hair and the state flag of Texas flapping overhead. It's got the vibe of a pleasure cruise, if it weren't for the smell. Elizabeth Trovall: Oh yeah, now it's really pungent. Amy Scott: My colleague, Elizabeth Trovall, who covers energy for Marketplace, invited me on this boat tour, a ride along the Houston Ship Channel, the industrial waterway that connects the Port of Houston to the Gulf of Mexico. Voice 1: As we leave the Turning Basin, off to the left you will see public grain elevator number one... Amy Scott: Chugging along, we see big metal grain elevators and giant cargo ships from far away countries, which Elizabeth looks up on her phone. Elizabeth Trovall: Her length overall is 179.98 meters, and her width is 32 meters. She's a hefty lass. Amy Scott: Until we reach the source of that smell, the oil refineries. Elizabeth Trovall: There's a bunch of white cylinders jutting up in the ground, and then, like hundreds of much smaller tubes. Amy Scott: I can see flames or flaring coming out of some of those tubes and what looks like steam churning out of smoke stacks. Whenever you see pictures on the news of climate change, they always show this, yeah. Some serious climate change B roll right here. Refineries like the one we're floating by process hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil every day, barrels that help make the state of Texas the biggest exporter of petroleum products in the US, and are also fueling a planetary crisis. Elizabeth Trovall: Oil and gas has been so important for the Texas economy, the US economy, the global economy, but also, like what climate are we leaving our children and our children's children? Amy Scott: That tension between the power of oil and gas and the urgency of the climate crisis, that's at the heart of a mystery that we're here in Texas trying to unfold. We're floating on the Houston Ship Channel looking for some clues like Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot interrogating suspects on the Nile. We're hoping to untangle a complicated plot, a plot to kill ESG. This is How We Survive. I'm Amy Scott. ESG, that's the investing framework that looks at environmental, social and governance factors. In the last episode, we traced how it evolved from a niche concept embraced by faith based and other socially conscious investors to a mainstream strategy promoted by the biggest asset managers in the world. Cue the backlash. Over the past few years, financial firms have scrubbed the acronym from their websites, dropped out of net zero initiatives and stopped advertising their climate efforts. Some have proclaimed ESG dead and buried. But if so, who killed it and why? In this episode, we take out our magnifying glasses to peer a little more closely at a piece of legislation in Texas that would spark dozens of other anti-ESG bills across the country, the weapon that made the first of a thousand cuts, all in service of protecting the fossil fuel industry. This episode, the death of ESG and the dark money behind its demise. ___ Okay? A little vertigo here. Oh, my God. We are in the, I guess this is the capitol rotunda, right? There's a star at the top of the dome that says, T, E, X, A, S, Texas. We're going to start our investigation where this all started, the state capitol building in Austin, Texas. And this is the heart of the Texas Legislature. We're here to meet with our first suspect in the plot to kill ESG. 06, Isaac. This is representative Carrie Isaac's office. Jason Isaac: Good to see you. Thanks for meeting me here. I appreciate it. Hey, how are you? I'm Jason. Amy Scott: But she's not who we're looking for. There's a rose. Jason Isaac: Yes, this is my wife's office, and apparently one of her colleagues gave her some sort of a rose for something. Amy Scott: Nice. We're here to meet this guy, her husband. That's our suspect. A proud one, I should say. You know what we're up to? We're looking at the rise of ESG investing as a concept, and then the backlash against it, sort of telling the story, and I understand you have a big role in the backlash part of that story. Jason Isaac: Yes, yeah. Amy Scott: Can you start by just introducing yourself? Jason Isaac: Sure. I'm Jason Isaac. I'm the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute. We're a non profit trade organization and research organization that represents American energy producers that support free markets, primarily oil, gas, coal and nuclear. Amy Scott: Jason Isaac has a bit of a reputation. Jason Isaac: It was Congressman Raskin who called me the Carbon King when I was testifying in front of Congress, because I said, I'm Jason Isaac, and I live a high carbon lifestyle, and I think the rest of the world should too. Amy Scott: So Jamie Raskin came up with that nickname? Jason Isaac: Jamie Raskin. It was, it was not a kind nickname. Amy Scott: But you've embraced it. Jason Isaac: I have. I love it. It's my license plate. I've got it on my business cards and my wallet. And I remind myself, and yes, absolutely. And I wish everybody else could be the Carbon King, too. Amy Scott: At the outset, you should know two things about Jason. Not only that he works on behalf of the oil and gas industry, but also he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is causing catastrophic climate change. Jason Isaac: I mean, if we're living in a catastrophic climate crisis, I want more of it, because people are prospering like never before because of energy. Amy Scott: Before he became known as the Carbon King, Jason was working at a conservative think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He led an energy initiative there called Life Powered. He says it was around 2019 when he started to hear something that bothered him. Jason Isaac: I had specific drilling companies, I had services companies that were telling me that their banks were denying them access to financial services because they were in the oil and gas industry. Amy Scott: These energy companies suspected they were being denied because of the banks' ESG policies. Jason Isaac: And I didn't know what ESG was at first, I just said they're discriminating against politically unfavored industries like oil and gas and forestry and guns and ammunition manufacturers. Amy Scott: And so what did you decide to do about it? Jason Isaac: Well, it was interesting, because one of them kind of challenged me. It's like, Jason, you've got to fix this. And so I thought, oh gosh. Amy Scott: Jason says a light went off. He recalled a bill he'd worked on a few years earlier when he was serving in the Texas House of Representatives. It was aimed at preventing companies from boycotting Israel. So he thought, hey, why not just replace Israel with oil and gas? Jason Isaac: I essentially just said, If you boycott fossil fuels, you can't do business with the state of Texas. Amy Scott: The bill would prohibit any government entity in Texas, so pension funds or school districts, from doing business with financial firms found to be boycotting oil and gas, a sort of boycott uno reverse card. So you boycotted companies that you saw as boycotting other companies? Jason Isaac: Yeah, I just didn't want them using our tax dollars, our pension dollars from teachers, firefighters, other first responders that are entrusted with companies. I didn't want those dollars, and in some cases, our tax dollars, being weaponized against the best interest of Texas. Amy Scott: So the sort of confusing thing here is that these companies that Jason sees as boycotting fossil fuels in Texas, these are financial firms and banks that, in some cases, invest billions of dollars in oil and gas in Texas, which seems like the opposite of a boycott. The problem, Jason says, is the way that some of these financial firms invest. Jason Isaac: They're investing in them, forcing them to transition, forcing them to adopt political agendas which are contrary to popular opinion here in the legislature in Texas, and so I really felt like they were weaponizing their capital, trying to, using Larry Fink's terms, force behaviors. Amy Scott: Remember Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, whose now infamous 2020 letter to CEOs declared that climate risk is investment risk? Jason says, while it's true, BlackRock invests more than $100 billion in Texas oil and gas, the company has also used its shareholder power to push companies to address climate change. To Jason and his conservative allies in the legislature, that kind of activism had no place in Texas. Voice 2: Senator Birdwell, you recognized committee substitute for Senate Bill 13 to suspend the regular order of business. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr... Amy Scott: In the spring of 2021, on the green carpet of the baroque Senate chambers, a Republican state senator brought Jason's anti-ESG bill, now known as Senate Bill 13, to a vote. Voice 3: On behalf of lucky number 13, Mr. President, I move final passage. Amy Scott: It passed the first chamber, the Senate, with almost no opposition. Voice 2: There being 26 ayes and four nays, the bill is finally passed. Voice 3: Thank you, Mr. President for all your work on this. Amy Scott: But one person in the room felt something was not quite right. Do you feel like you have a lonely position here? Nathan Johnson: I think there's a matter of record of I have a lonely position here. Amy Scott: This is state senator Nathan Johnson. He was one of the four nays on Senate Bill 13. He's a Democrat, a lawyer and a composer. Millennials may recognize his music from the TV anime show Dragon Ball Z. Nathan Johnson: I did the music for 67 episodes and five of their movies. Amy Scott: Do you still get royalties for that? Nathan Johnson: I don't get any royalties at all for that. I got into the business at the wrong time. Amy Scott: In our murder mystery scenario, Senator Johnson is like the witness watching in horror as the scene unfolded. Nathan Johnson: I think the whole notion of passing laws that interfere with the private flow of capital is anathema to the whole Texas ethos of being a business friendly state, and it smacked of big government interference with markets. Amy Scott: Battling some of the biggest financial firms in the US, limiting market options, telling companies what they can and can't do, seemed like just a different form of the market interference the bill's supporters claim to oppose. Nathan Johnson: The job of a financial services institution is to make money. They want to take capital and invest it and get it a return. And if they think they can do it with a wind farm or a pump jack, they're going to pick the one that gives a good return. Amy Scott: Increasingly, it's the wind or solar farm investors are betting on. Texas is actually leading the country in renewable energy production, and Johnson says this anti-ESG legislation looks to him like a campaign to slow down the transition. Nathan Johnson: Which I think is silly. The fossil fuel industry is well integrated with the renewable energy generation industry. Wind farms and solar farms are powering oil and gas operations. So it's unfortunate that we're having this silly conversation right now, because it's helping no one. Amy Scott: After SB 13 passed, again saying Texas would boycott any financial firms that boycott oil and gas, the state had to figure out who was in compliance, so officials created a black list. It named 10 firms at first, including BlackRock, which again, invested more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies at the time. It also included nearly 350 individual funds. The firms on the black list were banned from any financial activity that used state money. That meant everything from managing public pensions to underwriting municipal bonds, and that might have been the end of it, the infliction of this first cut to ESG, but for this man, our second suspect. ___ Would you mind just introducing yourself? Tell us who you are and what you do and where we are. Brian Hughes: Thanks. I'm Brian Hughes, and so glad to be with you in the Texas capitol today. Amy Scott: Senator Brian Hughes of district one in East Texas. Senator Hughes co-authored Senate Bill 13. But that bill, that first wound to ESG, wasn't enough for the Senator. He really wanted to twist the knife. Brian Hughes: Good morning, everyone. For many of you, I'll say, Welcome to Marshall, and for Marshall folks I'll say, Thank you for letting us be here and enjoy this... Amy Scott: He wanted to throw a harsher spotlight on what financial firms were up to with this ESG stuff, and make sure they knew Texas was serious about cracking down. So a couple months after the blacklist came out, in late 2022, Senator Hughes and the state affairs committee he chaired summoned a bunch of Wall Street firms to a remote corner of East Texas for questioning. Representatives from BlackRock, State Street, Global Advisors and institutional shareholder services, an advisory firm, made the trek out to the small city of Marshall, and were greeted with a show. Brian Hughes: We had the hearing in December and so the Christmas lights are up. There's an ice skating rink set up on the town square. It's a beautiful Norman Rockwell feel. What we were looking for was to be in this environment of a Hallmark movie. Except for the firms we subpoenaed. We wanted a John Grisham movie for them. Amy Scott: He gave them a six hour grilling, challenging them on all the ways they were trying to take down the fossil fuel industry, like offering ESG funds that screen out some energy companies, joining net zero initiatives aimed at drawing down emissions, voting to support some environmental and social shareholder resolutions like the board shake up at Exxon Mobil we talked about last episode. Brian Hughes: When it comes to ESG investing, which interest is BlackRock trying to serve? The general welfare of your clients, the general welfare of humanity, or the sole financial interest of those clients. Amy Scott: Again and again, Senators accused the companies of putting ideology ahead of their fiduciary duty to act in their clients' best interests, while company reps insisted that duty required them to consider ESG factors that could affect their investments. But Senator Hughes wasn't persuaded. BlackRock stayed on the black list. Brian Hughes: And our response to them has been very, very simple. If you don't want to be on the list, then don't attack the Texas energy industry. Amy Scott: Since then, the list has grown to a total of 16 companies and includes big global firms like BNP Paribas, HSBC and UBS. And the senator isn't done. He's now trying to pass other bills to prevent financial firms from considering non-financial factors in investing and lending decisions. In some ways, his tactics have worked. Before the hearing, Vanguard, another big asset manager, appeased Texas lawmakers by dropping out of a net zero initiative, and in the years since, BlackRock and others have followed suit and dialed back at least their public support for ESG initiatives. But if Hughes's aim was to hurt the companies on the black list, he doesn't appear to have been successful. Most of these firms have grown even bigger. Critics of the effort say the people who have been hurt by all of this are Texans. Chris Hollins: So how has your trip to Houston slash Texas been? Amy Scott: It's been good. Yeah, very friendly. __ This is Chris Hollins, the city controller of Houston, Texas. He's an elected official responsible for Houston's $7 billion budget. We met him in his corner office on the eighth floor of City Hall. He's got a Hakeem Olajuwon college jersey on the wall from when the legendary basketball player was at the University of Houston. Chris Hollins: The jersey is Hakeem Olajuwon, but it's signed by the whole team. Amy Scott: Wow. How'd you get that? Chris Hollins: You know, I have my ways. Amy Scott: That's cool. That is cool. But we're here to talk about Senate Bill 13. Has it had an impact on the economy of Texas? Chris Hollins: I believe that it has. Amy Scott: One of the most important things that financial companies like BlackRock do is help towns and cities like Houston borrow money to fix roads or upgrade schools using the bond market. The firms bid for that business, so when a bunch of them get blacklisted for their ESG policies, there's less competition, and that can mean the cities and school districts end up paying more. Chris Hollins: You take economics 101, and you understand that if I'm the only, if I if I'm the only bidder, and I know that, then I can go in with a little bit higher of a price, and you're probably going to say, Yes, right? It lessens our negotiating power, which we know ultimately has that negative impact on on our bottom line. Amy Scott: Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Wharton School studied the impact of anti-ESG legislation in Texas, including Jason Isaac's bill. They estimated that in the first eight months they were in effect, these laws cost the state between $300 and $500 million in higher borrowing costs. Chris Hollins: A huge chunk of what we spend money on is debt service, right? It's paying interest on money that we borrowed and and so all the money that, the millions and millions of dollars that we're paying in interest, that's money that we're not spending on hiring more police officers. It's money that we're not spending on fixing potholes or beautifying our parks to make this a better city to live in and enjoy with your family. So there are real victims here. Amy Scott: Controller Hollins, who's a Democrat, says it's disappointing to see politicians sitting in Austin, hours away, making policies that he feels are harmful to his city. Chris Hollins: And it's even worse when you when you can put like a nice southern drawl on it and sound all, you know, I don't know hokey and kind and whatever, but all you're doing is is just really waking up and going to hurt people every day. Amy Scott: Who have those policies hurt? Can you give some examples? Chris Hollins: The the millions who are being impacted by changes in climate when there are disaster after disaster pummeling our state, especially in the coastal areas. We're the energy capital of the world and just you know, in recent past, we can't keep the lights on during certain natural disasters. Last year, climate related disasters cost Texas between $20 and $50 billion. Amy Scott: When we visited Houston, the city had just been through a deep freeze. Chris Hollins: And the recovery is is getting more and more costly. That little chicken scratch that y'all saw on the table when you came in, it was it was around our disaster recovery costs, which are estimated to be upwards of $200 million just for what happened this past year. Amy Scott: To controller Hollins, the ESG backlash is just another form of climate denial that's delaying action to address the crisis and will cost Texas not just money, but lives in the future. But to conservative lawmakers, it's another front in the broader culture war, another acronym like DEI and CRT, to distort and demonize. After it passed in Texas, Senate Bill 13 became a blueprint for Republican legislators across the country. Dozens of bills in states like Oklahoma, Kentucky and West Virginia have used Jason Isaac's language as a template. It was a targeted coordinated attack that delivered a thousand cuts to the concept of ESG and left it bleeding out in the stairwell. But the lawmakers that wielded the knives weren't operating alone. Turns out, they were hired killers funded by a river of dark money. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: After the break, the tangled web of right wing think tanks and fossil fuel interest groups that funded the plot to kill ESG. [BREAK] Amy Scott: What are some of your favorite slurs that the right has given ESG? Kelly Mitchell: Oh, that's a fun question. Amy Scott: Like woke capital is one, woke capitalism. Kelly Mitchell: Woke capitalism might be my favorite, just because it's so kind of absurd on the face. Like nothing BlackRock is doing is woke. Amy Scott: This is Kelly Mitchell. We heard from her in episode one. She's executive director of the investigative watchdog group Fieldnotes, and she's been following the anti-ESG backlash since the very beginning. If Kelly was the lead investigator in our ESG murder mystery, she'd have an evidence board in her office with red yarn connecting pictures with suspects that would take up the entire wall, maybe even several rooms. But what Kelly's tracking isn't just the people and the organizations who delivered a thousand cuts to ESG, it's the money and power behind them. And there are really two main sources of money, the business folks and the culture warriors. Kelly Mitchell: We've seen a lot of alignment between the oil and gas industry and sort of the broader, sort of hard right movement. Amy Scott: These are the people and the groups in the shadows that paid for the knives that policy makers wielded against ESG. Kelly Mitchell: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a long time recipient of oil money, most notably from the Koch brothers and Koch Industries. Amy Scott: The Texas Public Policy Foundation is the conservative think tank where Jason Isaac worked when he wrote Senate Bill 13. According to climate research firm Pleiades Strategy, over the last 10 years, the think tank has received about $13 million from foundations linked to Koch, Inc., the big conglomerate that's deeply involved in oil and gas. Another funder is oil and gas tycoon Bud Brigham. Bud Brigham: I found the Texas Public Policy Foundation to be a very effective think tank for the principles that I believe in. So I have invested over the years with them quite a bit. Amy Scott: We reached out to Bud because he's been gunning for ESG for years. Back in 2021 he published a white paper with the Texas Public Policy Foundation called "Energy discrimination: a threat to capitalism, prosperity and flourishing." In his paper, he questions accepted climate science and calls ESG a cancerous threat to our way of life. Bud Brigham: The ESG movement, it became apparent that it was like DEI, a Trojan horse for these political movements, in this case, to co-opt companies away from oil and natural gas by those that view it as detrimental, and so I felt like I needed to stand up for capitalism. Amy Scott: Bud Brigham's ideas influenced Jason Isaac, who wrote Senate Bill 13. Ideas that through that white paper and Jason's legislation began to spread across the country. Since 2021, legislators have introduced more than 470 anti-ESG bills in 40 states. That's again, according to Pleiades Strategy. 48 of those bills, so a little over 10%, became law, some modeled after Jason Isaac's bill. Others taking a different approach, but each one sliced away at ESG with the help of the people in the shadows. Kelly Mitchell: As this fight has grown, there have been a number of other groups, other major dark money players, that have stepped in to take advantage of the momentum. Amy Scott: Dark money is, by its nature, hard to track, but some familiar names are tacked up on Kelly's evidence board. Kelly Mitchell: Some of those include groups that are backed by Leonard Leo, most famous for basically shaping Trump's Supreme Court. Through his various affiliates, he's poured millions of dollars into this anti-ESG movement with the goal of crushing liberal dominance and really taking on the quote woke left and woke capitalism. Amy Scott: Groups backed by Leo, a conservative lawyer, include the nonprofit Consumers Research, which funds the State Financial Officers Foundation, an organization of Republican State Treasurers and auditors. Another big player in the backlash is the Heritage Foundation, whose fellow Andy Puzder, former fast food CEO, had this to say about ESG. Andy Puzder: ESG investing is socialism in sheep's clothing, and this is, this is the challenge of your generation. My father's generation's challenge was the Nazis. Amy Scott: Puzder was speaking at a workshop about ESG. The investigative watchdog Documented, where Kelly used to work, got hold of this recording, which was first verified and aired by the program Here and Now. Andy Puzder: The challenge of your generation is ESG investing, and it's more insidious than communism or the Nazis. Kelly Mitchell: I don't even know how to respond to that, but I think it does speak to the hyperbolic nature and the fear mongering that's come along with something as simple as like evaluating risk. Amy Scott: This is just a fraction of the suspects on Kelly's board, which is actually a PDF put together by her and her colleagues. It's a tangled web of think tanks, advocacy groups, corporations and oil and gas trade associations, including the Heartland Institute, Heritage Action for America, American Petroleum, Independent Women's Forum, Capital Research Center, American Legislative Exchange Council, America First Policy Institute. And many, many more. ___ Yes, it kind of makes your head spin, doesn't it? Kelly Mitchell: It does make my head spin. Amy Scott: We've got oil billionaires and Republican treasurers, anti-woke pundits and climate deniers. And what's even more baffling about all this is that the thing they're so afraid of, this so-called woke capitalist threat to fossil fuels, doesn't seem to be doing what its critics think it's doing. In fact, last year, the United States produced more oil and gas than any country ever has. Kelly says part of the problem with ESG is that it's so poorly defined. To critics on the right, it's part of an activist plot to bring down the fossil fuel industry, but to critics on the left, it's not doing nearly enough to actually address the climate crisis. Kelly Mitchell: In part because we don't really have the tools to distinguish green washing and empty promises from real, long term commitments. Amy Scott: And in some ways, that vagueness has left ESG open to attack. Kelly Mitchell: The death of ESG, if we're going to call it that, is really complicated. It's morphed into this buzzword that can now mean anything to anybody, and so identifying a single culprit is quite difficult here. Amy Scott: But the backlash has had a chilling effect. Big firms are leaving net zero initiatives in droves. Investment in ESG funds has fallen in each of the past three years. CEOs have scrubbed the letters ESG from their websites and public speeches, and maybe the final nail in the coffin, the SEC just dropped efforts to require companies to disclose climate related risks. So is ESG dead? Kelly Mitchell: The buzz word ESG may be dead. The movement has succeeded in, unfortunately, turning it into something quite politically charged and toxic. But the underlying principles are incredibly durable because they're based in reality. The truth is the world will decarbonize. The truth is that climate disasters are increasing in their frequency and their severity. Smart investors will continue to look at those risks. They will evaluate those risks, and they will price it into their investment decisions. They're probably just not going to do it under the banner of ESG. Amy Scott: Okay, so maybe the body of ESG is buried six feet under but that doesn't mean its spirit doesn't live on. Jason Isaac: These financial institutions are essentially now kind of like reverse virtue signaling. So they're virtue signaling to us, but in their statements, they're saying we're going to continue the policies that align with the energy transition. I wasn't using that term green hushing, but I may have to add that to my vocabulary. Amy Scott: Next episode, the evolution, or maybe reincarnation, of ESG.

Title: Naomi Campbell, Larry Fink And The Pressing Need For Digital Identity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/04/16/naomi-campbell-larry-fink-and-the-pressing-need-for-digital-identity/
Time Published: 2025-04-16T09:05:07Z
Full Content:
ByDavid G.W. Birch ByDavid G.W. Birch, Contributor. Naomi Campbell on May 13, 2018 during the Fashion For Relief Cannes event (Photo by YANN ... More COATSALIOU/AFP via Getty Images) The Financial Times magazine has one of the most interesting stories about money and digital identity that I have read for a long time. It is a story about supermodels and billionaires and lawyers and fraud, so I cannot resist drawing attention to it and noting the connection between Naomi Campbell and Larry Fink. The essence of the story is that the famous supermodel Naomi Campbell was introduced to a woman who she thought was a lawyer, but the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said that the woman in question had never been a solicitor in England and Wales, so I assume that Ms. Campbell (just like the rest of us) had never thought to check whether the woman really was a lawyer or not. Ms. Campbell is quoted as saying “I trusted her, as she was presented to me as a lawyer”. (Rather interestingly, the SRA also noted that “the term lawyer is not a protected term”, something that had not occurred to me, so that unregulated individuals working in the law can refer to themselves as such.) The “lawyer” became a trustee of Ms. Campbell’s Fashion for Relief charity and managed the charity’s day-to-day operations. She went on to conduct a variety of transactions, which eventually included engaging expensive actual lawyers to act on Ms. Campbell’s behalf. Or, at least, that is what the actual lawyers thought. They had verified Ms. Campbell’s identity by requesting a copy of her passport (which was sent to them) and confirmation of the engagement. This confirmation came in the form of an email, and from then on the lawyers communicated with “Ms. Campbell” via this email address, not noticing that the address that purported to be Ms. Campbell’s personal email address was in fact different from her actual address by a single character. This fascinating story illustrates rather well two different problems that need to fixed if we are to benefit from an efficient online economy. The first is that of fraudulent identity (is this Naomi Campbell?) and the second is that of fraudulent credentials (is this a lawyer?). We (society) need both of these problems to be solved, and we need them to be solved soon. (And please note, even if you do not care that much about supermodels being ripped off by bogus lawyers, that this is not only money, it is also about lives. Here in the UK we have just had the example of a man accused of signing off fire safety certificates for flats in high-rise blocks using the credentials and signature of qualified engineer.) At the same time that I was reflecting on Ms. Campbell’s experiences, I noticed that Larry Fink, the billionaire CEO of Blackrock (which has some $10 trillion in assets under management) wrote in his 2025 letter to investors that "One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs—provided we crack one critical problem: identity verification… If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too”. I interpret Mr. Fink’s plea as a demand to tackle both problems, fraudulent identification and fraudulent credentials, and I could not agree more with his prioritisation of the issue. I’ve been saying the same thing for years, arguing that that there is no way forward in fintech (or, in fact, pretty much any other sector) without the development of digital identity infrastructure, but now that supermodels and billionaires are saying it, hopefully something will get done. The good news is that the technologies we need to address those challenges are well-known and well-understood. Highway patrol. At the recent Secure Technology Alliance summit in San Diego, Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) took centre stage—and for good reason. With millions of mDLs already out there in the US (and soon in the UK too) we are perhaps close to tackling the identification problem. Simon Curry, VP of EMV at Visa, said at that summit that “mDLs offer the best option we have today in the arms race we’re in to combat the ever-evolving world of threat and fraud from bad actors and AI -- and it’s a significant leap forward”. Take California as an example. They held a hackathon last fall, where companies including Fime1, Mitek, MATTR, Ping Identity, Incode and others showed some of the possibilities. Just to illustrate a few of these possibilities: A team from Cisco won “Most Promising” for an application of mDLs as a root digital identity for passwordless authentication; Developers from Block won “Best Privacy and Security Design” for an in-person age check application for merchants using Square; And a team from U.S. Bank won “Most Scalable” for an in-person identity verification implementation for bank branches to carry out high-risk transactions. The building blocks of the next generation financial market infrastructure are here, but we need some kind of verification framework to make them work. Going back to the issue of the lawyer who was not a lawyer. While mDLs might help with identity, the DMV does not know whether you are a lawyer or not, but bar associations, including those in California, do. They have been exploring the idea of digital or verifiable credentials for legal professionals. Such credentials could streamline identity verification, improve security, and facilitate interstate practice by providing a standardised way to verify a lawyer’s qualifications and standing. Once you have you driving licence in a digital wallet, it does not test the boundaries of human imagination to forsee the California bar association having a a service whereby lawyers can go online, identify themselves using their mDL and then obtain their licence to practice as a verifiable credential to be stored in the same wallet. (After all, the American Bar Association already allows lawyers to download their membership cards into those digital wallets.) Since the consumer’s digital wallet would be able to check the digital signature on the credential presented by the lawyer and know for sure that it was valid, issued by the relevant bar association to the person in possession of the mobile phone, we should be able to take out a fraud vector and in doing so reduce the overall cost of intermediation. Of course, as Jan Vereecken, the CPO over at meeco, points out in an interesting piece about trust in digital identity infrastructures, digital signatures are evidence of origin and not evidence of trust (in itself a complex topic). It might be time consuming and inconvenient for Ms. Campbell to find out whether someone is a lawyer or not, but digital identity should mean that her iPhone could do it in a couple of seconds. Whether she should trust the lawyer or not… well, that’s another story.

Title: Institutional support for tokenization grows

Time Published: 2025-04-16T08:21:58Z

Increasing numbers of institutional investors and wealth managers are predicting growth in tokenization as more become aware of the benefits, according to new global research by London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management (Nickel), Europe’s leading digital assets hedge fund manager founded by alumni of Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. 0 16 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The study with organisations invested in the sector found 87% believe fund managers will increasingly look at the potential to tokenize investment funds and asset classes over the next three years. That compares to 75% who predicted more fund managers would explore tokenization when the study was last conducted just over six months ago.Nickel believes growing support for the expansion of tokenization is being driven by rising awareness of the benefits it potentially offers. Its research with institutional investors and wealth managers in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage around $1.1 trillion in assets shows the role of tokenization in facilitating liquidity and offering secondary marketing trading options are being recognised as the most attractive benefits. They were rated the top two benefits by professional investors ahead of greater transparency and their role in enabling fractional ownership of assets while reduced settlement times and enhanced risk management were rated as the fifth and sixth most attractive benefits. Reduced cost was ranked seventh.The study however shows there are still challenges to be addressed before tokenization is more widely adopted - around 74% point to distribution issues while 73% are concerned about regulation.Around 61% say widespread adoption of tokenization will run up against investors’ reluctance to change while 59% identified the maturity of service providers as a challenge and 55% the current lack of tokenized assets. Less than half (49%) are concerned about the security risk of tokenization and only 45% say lack of demand is a challenge.Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and Founding Partner at Nickel Digital, said: ““Tokenization is rapidly moving from concept to cornerstone with global heavyweights like BlackRock publicly endorsing tokenization as the future of financial markets.”“It is great to see the increasing numbers of investors from our first survey to the current one agreeing with this paradigm shift — one where improved liquidity, enhanced transparency, and instant settlement will become the new standard.”

Title: Investors pull $795M from crypto funds amid tariff, Fed fears – Details

XRP and multi-asset funds outperformed most crypto investments products last week. Investors pulled $795 million from crypto funds last week, marking the third week of sell-offs. In fact, according to CoinShares’ weekly asset flows report, Bitcoin [BTC] led the outflows with $751 million, while Ethereum bled $37.6 million. The report linked the extended decline to tariff uncertainty. “Digital asset investment products saw a 3rd consecutive week of outflows last week, totalling US$795m, as recent tariff activity continues to weigh on sentiment towards the asset class.” Source: CoinShares BlackRock’s iShares ETF products recorded the highest investor withdrawals (sell-off). As per the report, iShares’ BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs, collectively, saw $342 million outflows last week. From a month-to-date (MTD) perspective, BlackRock bled $412 million, nearly half a billion over the past two weeks alone. Source: CoinShares Grayscale products followed closely with $187 million outflows, nearly half of BlackRock’s dump. On the altcoins front, Solana-based products ranked third after ETH in outflows. The products saw a $5.1 million sell-off. Surprisingly, XRP-based and multi-asset funds were the only outliers during last week’s decline. The report noted that XRP saw $3.4 million inflows last week, and the overall MTD flows stood at $1.5 million. Simply put, investors preferred XRP and multi-asset (crypto index ETFs) to individual assets like BTC or ETH in the first half of April. Additionally, the aforementioned idea was further supported by record inflows into the new 2x Tecrium XRP ETF. Worth noting, however, that some macro analysts projected that the decline could continue. Quinn Thompson, founder of macro-focused hedge fund Lekker Capital, stated that a recent speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell will be bad for risk assets in May, including crypto. “Barring a collapse in economic data before then, they (Powell and Governor Waller) prefer patience amidst the elevated uncertainty. This is good for bonds but bad for risk assets.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Amid Trump’s tariff war, Germany’s next leader keeps faith in free trade

Despite Donald Trump’s lurch into protectionism and coercion, Friedrich Merz believes a transatlantic trade deal can still be done. BERLIN — Stop us if you’ve heard this one before: A German political leader on the eve of taking power promises that free trade is the answer to the country’s economic challenges. The approach worked for decades after World War II, as the export-driven Wirtschaftswunder propelled the then-West Germany to unparalleled prosperity. Now, even as President Donald Trump launches the biggest trade war in a century, Germany’s next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is betting that Europe can still do a free-trade deal with the United States. One which it can negotiate, moreover, from a position of strength. “The best thing we can do is all work together to achieve zero tariffs on transatlantic trade. Then the problem will be solved,” Merz said in an interview on TV channel RTL after his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) agreed last week to form a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD). For Merz, the trade headwinds blasting across the Atlantic couldn’t come at a worse time, with Europe’s largest economy facing a third year of recession. On top of that, as the EU’s leading exporter, Germany and its auto industry are most exposed to Trump’s universal tariffs — 10 percent on most goods, along with 25 percent levies on steel, aluminum and cars. (Trump last week paused a higher, discretionary tariff of 20 percent against the EU for 90 days to open the way for trade talks.) Merz, 69, has made long careers in both business and politics as a champion of the $1.6 trillion transatlantic trading relationship and the NATO alliance — which was conceived to keep America engaged in Europe while keeping Germany “down” and allowing it to grow into an export powerhouse. The trained lawyer headed the Atlantic Bridge, a German nonprofit, for a decade, and among other roles chaired the German arm of U.S. investment giant Blackrock.A transatlantic free-trade deal was a central economic policy pitch that Merz made on the election campaign trail. His incoming government’s policy pact strives for an FTA with the U.S. “in the medium term,” while in the near term seeking to avoid a trade conflict and to secure the reduction of import duties. At the same time, Merz has sought to project an image of strength and resolve toward Washington. “The key message to Donald Trump is: Germany is back on track,” he said in English as he unveiled the coalition deal. The mixed signals are impossible to miss. “Merz seems to be wavering in recent weeks,” U.S. expert Laura von Daniels, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told POLITICO. The incoming chancellor, she said, alternates between advocating closer U.S. ties and warning Brussels to brace for the end of Trump’s NATO protection, while vowing European independence. Merz is finally ascending the summit of German power after decades in the political wilderness. He made a name for himself in the 1990s as a fiscal hawk, only to be sidelined by the centrist Angela Merkel, who went on to rule for 16 years. He finally claimed the top job in the CDU on his third attempt at the end of 2021, going on to lead the party to a weak victory in the Feb. 23 general election with less than 30 percent of the vote. Despite their long years in opposition, Merz and his advisers appear to have few ideas on how to address the vulnerabilities of Germany’s export-oriented economy in a world where China is already a systemic rival and the United States is turning hostile. Yes, in throwing more than €1 trillion at upgrading Germany’s decaying infrastructure and rearming, Merz is trying to create a domestic driver for growth. But when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world, his thinking on trade resembles Germany’s postwar golden age. “I actually had the feeling with the U.S. chapter [of the coalition pact] that it wasn’t a description of reality at all,” Claudia Major, a foreign and defense analyst with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told POLITICO’s Berlin Playbook Podcast. “It’s more of a prayer. It’s almost like an invocation of the past that we all know isn’t coming back.” A free-trade deal “is wishful thinking in the current global situation,” Sandra Detzer, a lawmaker from the opposition Green party, told POLITICO. So far, Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič — who negotiates on behalf of the 27 member countries that form the EU’s single market — has not managed to de-escalate tensions in three rounds of talks with Trump administration officials. A Commission statement on Šefčovič’s latest talks in Washington on Monday called on the U.S. to take the bloc’s offer to negotiate on tariffs seriously. “As with every negotiation, this must be a two-way street / two-way engagement, with both sides bringing something to the table,” said Commission trade spokesperson Olof Gill. Trade experts say that a deal recalling the ambition of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), where talks foundered nearly a decade ago, is today out of reach. “We no longer live in a world in which trade experts spend years negotiating the details of individual chapters in conference rooms in Brussels and Washington,” von Daniels said. “These days, it’s more about sectoral deals — narrow agreements, not mega-deals,” added Julian Hinz, an economics professor at the University of Bielefeld who also leads research on trade at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Merz seems to have gotten the memo, in recent days dialing back his calls for a broad FTA and instead backing a proposal by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a narrower deal with the U.S. to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero. To even have a chance of achieving that, he would need to foster ties with other EU members — and to sell France’s protectionist elite on the idea of freer trade with the rest of the world. “The number of countries contacting us and saying: 'We want to conclude free trade agreements with you very quickly,' has never been as high as it is now. So let’s do it!” Merz told TV interviewer Caren Miosga on Sunday. Merz will also need to exert his influence to prevent Trump from picking off other European leaders with offers of sweetheart deals. The American president “is trying to divide the Europeans,” said Sebastian Roloff, a lawmaker who negotiated the economic parts of the coalition agreement on behalf of the Social Democrats. Subject to both the CDU and the SPD approving the coalition agreement, Merz hopes to be elected chancellor May 6. He is due to fly to Paris the next day for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, according to sources familiar with the matter. Trade — whether free or not — will be on the agenda. Koen Verhelst and Clea Caulcutt contributed reporting. Graphic by Giovanna Coi. Berlin wants more robust military spending following a bombshell move by the Trump administration to negotiate a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. president faces outrage from Arab countries and key European capitals over his “dangerous” proposal that Palestinians should be removed from the coastal enclave. Billionaire’s animosity toward German mainstream politicians and his affection for the AfD could bode poorly for Germany’s next government. The release marks the 10th time the two combatant nations have exchanged captives this year.

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Japanese financial services firm Keyaki Capital has launched the country’s first online private asset investment platform for high-net-worth investors, according to a statement. At launch, the platform features an open-ended private credit fund currently distributed by Keyaki Capital, the statement said. The Tokyo-based firm plans to introduce additional private capital funds, including private equity, private credit, real estate and venture capital funds in the future. The firm’s move comes as digital investment platforms have expanded rapidly globally in recent years, enabling investors to benefit from greater transparency and easier access to opportunities in different areas. There have also been efforts to make the burgeoning private markets more accessible, including BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink’s pledge last month to open them up to millions of everyday investors. Just last week, Singapore-based digital wealth management platform Endowus launched two alternative asset class portfolios that provided investors access to multiple, semiliquid private market funds. The funds comprise a diversified private credit portfolio of strategies from firms like Apollo Global Management, Ares Management, and Blackstone, and a new private equity portfolio that offers access to names such as Carlyle Group and EQT.

Amidst global economic uncertainties and potential trade disruptions, fixed income is gaining traction as a haven for investors. Saurav Ghosh suggests a 33-33-33 allocation strategy across short-term corporate bonds, longer-tenure G-Secs, and high-rated corporate bonds. With India's stable economy and anticipated rate cuts, locking in rates now offers a promising avenue for portfolio stability and consistent returns.

Title: Dollar-Cost Averaging Versus Lump Sum Investing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinmckenna/2025/04/15/dollar-cost-averaging-versus-lump-sum-investing/
Time Published: 2025-04-15T19:06:00Z

ByKristin McKenna ByKristin McKenna, Senior Contributor. If you have a large amount of excess cash to invest, consider dollar-cost averaging as it helps ... More investors stay invested and avoid the temptation to try to time the market. If you have a large amount of excess cash to invest, you may wonder if it’s better to invest over time by dollar-cost averaging or put a lump sum into the market at once. Whether you have extra cash sitting on the sidelines or are second-guessing your investment strategy, it’s easy to let hindsight bias or a fear of losing money impact your decisions. Especially during periods of heightened uncertainty, dollar-cost averaging a large sum can be an effective way to reduce risk and avoid temptation to try and time the market or predict short term volatility. Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that invests a set amount of money over a period of time as illustrated by the example below. If markets decline, investors can buy more shares with the same investment amount, and thus benefit more from an eventual recovery. Of course, in rising markets, the opposite is true. How dollar-cost averaging can help investors during volatile markets. By making a continuous investment at predetermined intervals, perhaps the first trading day of the month, it takes the decision making out of it and helps minimize volatility as contributions are spread over time. As market conditions change, for better or worse, you'll continue investing. The example below compares two scenarios: a lump sum investment of $120,000 in January 2020 compared to a dollar-cost average strategy with $10,000 invested each month from January through December 2020. Both scenarios assume all funds are invested in the S&P 500 (SPY). Since 2020 was one of the most volatile years in the history of the financial markets, it's a good example. Comparing a hypothetical lump sum investment of $120,000 in the S&P 500 on January 2020 vs a ... More dollar-cost averaging strategy (investing $10,000/month from January to December 2020). End of year values reflected in dollar terms. As you can see, by the end of the year, the dollar-cost averaging strategy marginally outperforms investing a lump sum immediately. Over time, since historically markets have been positive in magnitude and frequency more often than negative, we would expect lump sum investing to outperform. Despite a long-term view that shows growth potential over a typical investment horizon, it's so important not to discount the impact of investor psychology during downturns. Using the example above, by March 23rd 2020 (the bottom for the calendar year), the lump sum investor's portfolio would be worth less than $84,000, marking an unrealized loss of about $36,000 from their initial investment. In contrast, the dollar-cost averaging investor's account would be just shy of $22,000, for an unrealized loss of roughly $8,000. Here, the lump sum investor may be more prone to panic selling during declining markets and going back to cash. If they did, and if the other account continued putting money in the market at regular intervals, the gap at the end of the year would be significant. Investing over time can be particularly impactful for individuals experiencing a one-time sudden wealth or liquidity event. Of course, in practice, investors will want to match their risk tolerance with a diversified portfolio. The reality is that many investors don’t like to invest more when the market is down. The stock market is the only place where people run from a sale. In hindsight, after the market has recovered, investors often regret not taking advantage of what they now know to be a great buying opportunity. Dollar-cost averaging helps investors avoid the temptation to try to time the market or worse: abandon their investment plan altogether if facing significant losses. It can also help smooth the impact of price volatility and potentially lead to more favorable average prices. When it comes to dollar-cost averaging vs lump sum investing, the best approach may ultimately be a personal decision. Due to transaction costs and the cash drag on a portfolio, in situations where there's a smaller investment amount, it might be more advantageous to go with a lump sum approach. Also consider your target asset allocation and share prices compared to your excess cash. The stock market is no place to invest for quick returns. While dollar-cost averaging can help reduce the short-term impact of market fluctuations, avoiding volatility in the financial markets is unrealistic. Instead, investors should stay focused on long-term wealth building strategies and making sure their asset allocation is right given their life stage and risk tolerance. Time in the market is better than timing the market over the long term, and history shows that the longer you stay invested in the stock market, the better your chances of making money. So why not put a large sum to work at once? Investors often downplay the behavioral aspects of investing until faced with a big decision that carries risk. So when the thought of putting all your money in the market at once seems too stressful—don’t! Dollar-cost averaging can help individuals sleep at night. After all, hoarding cash isn’t an investment strategy. Disclosures Kristin McKenna is a Forbes contributor.

Title: BP Faces Shareholder Showdown Amid Oil Price Crash

More Info BP is holding its annual general meeting on April 17 in the early days of its strategy reset to return to its core oil and gas business while oil prices have crashed by more than $10 per barrel this month. Shareholders, especially activist hedge fund Elliott, will want to make their position known at the AGM votes on Thursday. Activist investor Elliott, which has been pushing for dramatic changes at BP since amassing a 5% stake in the supermajor, is likely to express its continued frustration with BP’s performance by voting against the re-election of directors. Fortunately for BP, one of the constant campaigners that has been pushing for years for shareholder resolutions on emissions and climate accountability at AGMs, Follow This, has just decided to pause its climate resolutions at Big Oil – for the first time since 2016 – citing investor hesitation about ESG investments and campaigning. Related: U.S. Oil Production Cuts May Be Avoided “Shareholder resolutions have been critical in compelling five oil majors to set emissions reduction targets, but most institutional investors are reluctant to use their voting power,” Mark van Baal of Follow This said last week ahead of the AGMs at the oil and gas supermajors. “It’s a strategic pause to get more investors on board and to discuss how to work together to uphold shareholder rights.” The backlash against ESG, combined with the trade war, has left investors uncertain about how to proceed with climate action, Follow This said. The climate campaign group noted that it “speaks with investors about addressing these barriers, exploring what prevents investors, like BlackRock, LGIM, and NBIM, from casting their votes in favour of Paris-alignment despite their public climate commitments.” In BP’s case, however, the step-back of Follow This appears to be the only good news for the company and its management these days. BP’s shares continue to lose more than its peers, including Shell and the U.S. supermajors, and have dipped in value more than those of the other majors during the oil price rout triggered by fears of weaker oil demand in light of the trade wars and uncertainty about tariffs. Year to date, BP’s stock has plunged by 18% despite the strategy reset announced at the end of February. To compare, Shell’s shares have lost 13% so far this year, while Exxon and Chevron have dropped by 4% and 6% respectively—much less than the oil price decline. BP’s strategy reset has failed to lift its stock performance despite the supermajor walking back on renewable energy spending and stepping up investment in fossil fuels. BP vowed to increase its investment in upstream oil and gas to $10 billion per year while slashing spending on clean energy by more than $5 billion a year. The pressure on BP became more intense this year after Elliott bought a nearly 5% stake in the supermajor and demanded changes in strategy or even board reshuffles. In a move seen as a win for Elliott, BP chair Helge Lund this month announced his intention to step down from the role “most likely during 2026.” This announcement doesn’t mean Elliott wouldn’t vote against Lund or other board directors at the shareholders’ meeting this week to express its dissatisfaction with how the company has been run. In a very unfortunate development for BP, any positive share performance from the strategy reset was obliterated within a month by the tariff and trade wars, which crashed the price of Brent Crude oil to the low $60s per barrel. Lower oil prices could test BPs ability to sustain its returns to shareholders, including dividends, especially as the supermajor flagged an increase in its net debt in the first quarter of 2025. BP warned of a weak natural gas trading result for the first quarter and said its net debt at quarter-end is expected to be around $4 billion higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to a working capital build. This, BP said, is largely expected to reverse, reflecting seasonal inventory effects, timing of payments including annual bonus payments, and payments related to low carbon assets held for sale. But Elliott and other shareholders will want more, and BP could struggle to deliver.

Title: Wall Street banks are cashing in on trade war chaos
URL: https://qz.com/bank-earnings-stock-goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-1851776233
Time Published: 2025-04-15T15:40:00Z

Banks are minting money from stock market whiplash. Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Morgan Stanley (MS) pulled in more than $12 billion in equities trading revenue last quarter. That surpasses the peak of the post-pandemic trading boom, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. “So far, the business is performing very well and clients are very active,” Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts. That activity is being driven by investors scrambling to recalibrate portfolios with each new signal on how President Donald Trump’s tariff plans might unfold. But inside the country’s biggest banks, first-quarter financial results tell a very different story — one where volatility isn’t a headwind, but a revenue engine. Yet despite the trading bonanza — and a modest rally in recent days — bank stocks remain deeply in the red. The sector is down roughly 15% year-to-date, compared with an 8% drop in the S&P 500 and a 13% decline in the Nasdaq. For investors, the question now is whether trading-fueled profits are a blip — or a turning point for the sector. Goldman Sachs opened the earnings floodgates Monday, reporting a 15% jump in profit to $4.74 billion, or $14.12 per share. That beat Wall Street expectations, and was powered by strong trading revenues. Posting results Tuesday, Bank of America (BAC) also outperformed, posting EPS of $0.90 on $27.37 billion in revenue. Like Goldman, it credited its trading division for the upside. CEO Brian Moynihan noted the bank is riding a wave of volatility, but warned that “we potentially face a changing economy in the future.” Citigroup (C) followed with a solid beat of its own: First-quarter net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, on $21.6 billion in revenue — a 3% increase from the prior year. Results were strong across all five of Citi’s core businesses, with standout performances in its markets and wealth divisions. And last Friday, JPMorgan Chase announced earnings of $5.07 per share on $46.01 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS of $4.91 excluding a one-time gain from the First Republic acquisition. Trading, investment banking, and asset management all helped drive the beat. Morgan Stanley that day reported net revenues of $17.7 billion, up from $15.1 billion a year earlier, also beating earnings estimates. It cited strong momentum in trading and wealth management, underscoring just how broad the gains have been across the financial sector — even if investor sentiment hasn’t yet caught up. BlackRock (BLK) also delivered: 12% top-line growth to $5.28 billion, adjusted EPS of $11.30, and record net inflows of $84 billion, led by iShares ETFs. The firm now manages $11.58 trillion in assets. So why are banks thriving amid all this chaos? In short: Volatility equals volume. When markets are choppy — as they’ve been throughout the first quarter, and even more so this month in the wake of Trump’s shifting tariff plans — investors rush to reposition their portfolios, hedging bets and chasing safer ground. That activity generates trading fees for banks, especially in their equities and fixed-income divisions. It’s a bit of a paradox: While market turmoil often hits consumer confidence and corporate dealmaking, it can be a windfall for bank trading desks tasked with executing those reactions. Still, a booming trading quarter (or two) doesn’t necessarily mean bank stocks are about to take off. Historically, financials tend to lag in recoveries, especially when the outlook for interest rates, credit quality, and economic growth is so murky. For instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, bank stocks took years to return to pre-crisis levels — while sectors such tech and consumer discretionary stocks bounced back much faster. And even in 2020, when trading revenues surged during pandemic volatility, that boost didn’t translate into lasting stock outperformance. For now, Wall Street banks are quietly riding the storm they didn’t directly create. Whether that success translates into enthusiasm for their own stocks is another question entirely, especially with economic risks still looming — and the full impact of tariffs yet to hit Main Street.

Title: Bitcoin ETF market steadies as BlackRock sees modest inflows with only outflows from Fidelity

Market sees cautious optimism in Bitcoin ETFs as BlackRock compensates for Fidelity's outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs showed early signs of stabilizing in mid-April following an aggressive seven-day period of outflows exceeding $872 million triggered by intensified US-China trade tensions. After ETF withdrawals tapered on April 10 with $14.9 million in outflows, activity nearly halted on April 11, recording minimal outflows of just $1 million. This reduction indicated cautious market sentiment and an emerging pause among investors reassessing Bitcoin’s stability around the $85,000 mark. April 14 marked a turning point, ending the prolonged outflow streak with modest net inflows totaling $1.5 million. Notably, Fidelity’s FBTC ETF recorded substantial withdrawals of $35.2 million, highlighting continued profit-taking or strategic repositioning by certain institutional investors, reflecting lingering caution. In contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF attracted $36.7 million, effectively offsetting Fidelity’s losses and signaling selective confidence returning to the ETF market.
