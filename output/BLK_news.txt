Feedback Jio Financial Services Ltd., led by Mukesh Ambani, is reportedly in talks with German insurance giant Allianz SE to explore a potential insurance partnership in India. Discussions are focused on establishing both general and life insurance companies in India, claimed a Bloomberg report. These talks are in early stages, and it is still unclear if the companies will proceed with the plan. Allianz is reportedly looking to exit its two existing joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd., marking the end of a partnership that has lasted more than two decades. Bajaj Finserv confirmed that Allianz is “actively considering an exit” from its life and general insurance ventures, citing a shift in Allianz's strategic priorities. This was confirmed following a report by Bloomberg. The break-up between Allianz and Bajaj Finserv stems from a dispute over the direction of the partnership, with sources indicating that Bajaj’s refusal to allow Allianz to raise its stake at a discounted price contributed to the rift. Additionally, Allianz reportedly was not given a say in key strategic decisions. A spokesperson for Jio Financial Services declined to comment on the ongoing speculation, stating, "If and when there are any material developments, we will continue to make necessary disclosures." A spokesperson for Allianz, based in Munich, also stated that the company does not comment on market rumors, Bloomberg stated in the report. Jio Financial, which is currently led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, has already ventured into financial services through a shadow banking operation and insurance brokerage. The firm has also teamed up with BlackRock Inc. to enter the asset management business. The addition of insurance to its portfolio would further Jio Financial’s ambitions of becoming a major player in India’s financial sector. India’s insurance penetration rate is significantly lower than that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, highlighting the sector’s potential for growth. According to data from the insurance regulator, this presents a considerable opportunity for companies like Jio Financial and Allianz. Business Today could not independently verify the details of the ongoing talks. The story will be updated following comments from Jio Financial and Allianz. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Title: WoW turns 20 (and we turn 20 years older) this year, with a huge anniversary event — here’s everything you need to know about the big birthday bash

NEXT | A checklist of achievement rewards and vendor loot to acquire durin... This year isn’t just another anniversary: with World of Warcraft turning 20, the game is getting a massive anniversary event that will let us relive old glories, collect plenty of loot, and even show off our favorite transmogs. The event is so large that it will take up an entire (minor) patch cycle, with all of patch 11.0.5 dedicated to the anniversary. The patch launches on October 22, and we’ll be able to participate in the anniversary celebration through November and December. But let’s get to the details! Here’s everything that’s happening for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday: If you prefer, you can consume the above information in video form, though if you do I have to assume that it has not in fact been 20 years for you. Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart. This is a woman who has been in a six-hour Blackrock Depths run with countless deaths that fell apart before making it to the last boss. I feel you here, Holly, though I am hopeful my current guild can handle the new raid’s 13 bosses without falling apart. While this event comprises the majority of patch 11.0.5, there are a couple of new things in the patch that aren’t directly related to the anniversary: I think it’s a fun patch, with plenty to keep us occupied until whatever Blizzard has planned for 11.0.7. I’ll be seeing you at the Trial of Style. Originally published September 4, 2024; updated October 22, 2024. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘If You’re Looking For Pure-Play, Go With Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT)’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-looking-pure-232237315.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T23:22:37Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a group of technicians working on complex data center systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Cramer recently called Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) a “pure-play’ and said: “Data centers remain one of the hottest themes in the market, and if you're looking for pure-play, go with Vertiv, which makes electrical equipment for these warehouses full of servers. Now that said, this stock is so red hot that it might not be able to rally on earnings unless it raises its forecast to unfathomable levels. Then again, Vertiv’s business is so strong, it's so strong that unfathomable might be fathomable.” Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) is engaged in creating and maintaining essential digital infrastructure technologies and lifecycle services tailored for data centers, communication networks, and a range of commercial and industrial applications. After reporting a strong performance in the first half of the year, it gave an upward adjustment to its full-year sales guidance by $50 million, with $75 million of this growth attributed to organic development. Alongside this, the company raised its full-year adjusted operating profit forecast by $85 million, now aiming for $1.435 billion. The increase is linked to a rise in sales volume and improved variable contribution margins anticipated in the latter half of the year, driven by improved productivity in both procurement and manufacturing processes. Additionally, the company also adjusted its full-year guidance for operating margins, now projecting an adjusted operating margin of 18.7% at the midpoint. It is an increase of 100 basis points from previous estimates and 200 basis points above initial forecasts made during the November investor conference. Furthermore, the company's forecasted adjusted diluted EPS for 2024 is set at $2.50 at the midpoint, representing over 40% growth compared to 2023, largely due to an increase in adjusted operating profit. Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) has been making significant strides in liquid cooling technology, positioning itself as an alternative to conventional energy management practices in data centers. In September, the company announced a significant expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in North America with the opening of a new facility in Pelzer, South Carolina. The site will add 215,000 square feet of production space and is expected to create up to 300 skilled jobs in the region. The Pelzer facility will focus on the production of various infrastructure solutions, including integrated modular systems and modular power solutions, capitalizing on the company’s extensive portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure technologies designed for data centers. Overall VRT ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration.

Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory.

There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade.

Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature.

Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies.

Among those highlighted in a Monday speech by SEC Chair Gary Gensler was the need to modernize equity markets, in part by embracing shorter settlement times. A retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers caused GameStop’s stock price to spike nearly four years ago amid the “meme stock” craze. Forced to hold or sell shares skyrocketing in price, restrictions imposed by several brokerage firms blunted the rally that was later enshrined in stock market history and recounted in books and films. Gensler, an unwavering critic of the digital assets industry, partly pinned the restrictions on a lack of market efficiency. Ultimately, a shift toward shorter settlement times—that experts say blockchains benefit from—improved upon mechanics that stifled some GameStop investors. “Many everyday investors lost access to the market at a critical time,” Gensler said. “The longer it takes for a trade to settle—the slower the plumbing—the more risk our markets assume.” When purchasing or selling a stock on a venue like the New York Stock Exchange, there is a delay between when the transaction is made and when it becomes fully processed across a series of intermediaries, including a broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. Notably, the SEC has accused crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase of fulfilling several of these roles at once, without proper registration, while facilitating securities transactions. Both companies have denied the regulator’s claims amid ongoing battles in federal courts. Once conducted through paper checks and physical certificates, the settlement window for securities has been shortened with SEC rule changes over time. Commonly referred to as T+2, a two-day settlement window was reduced in May, making what Gensler said was “a real difference” for everyday investors. At the same time, the shift to T+1 influenced the relationship between brokers, which match buyers and sellers, and clearinghouses that facilitate the exchange of securities and payments. Margin calls from clearinghouses led some brokers to restrict purchases of GameStop stock during its famed short squeeze in 2021. But the “amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse” was reduced significantly with T+1’s adoption, Gensler said. Gensler’s GameStop reflection followed crypto-focused remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller last week. Discussing the merits of decentralized finance (DeFi), he described how intermediaries have historically provided value—but now face competition. As reflected in the popularity of centralized crypto exchanges, Waller posited that DeFi could play a complementary role to existing financial markets, rather than replace legacy systems. Along those lines, he said distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain could be an “efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping,” while smart contracts flatten trade structures. “Smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act,” Waller said. “This can provide value, as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement.” Companies like tZERO are building blockchain-based marketplaces for private securities. The Utah-based firm gained approval from the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to operate as a custodian for digital assets sold as securities last month. In early 2025, the firm plans to launch with a “full digitization” of its Series-A preferred equity. But Wall Street tastemakers have visions for a crypto-based market extending far beyond that. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed tokenization as the “next generation for securities” in 2022. Using a digital representation of an asset to conduct trades on a blockchain, he said the process would provide market participants with “instantaneous settlement” and “reduced fees.” Alongside the crypto’s rise, financial firms have looked at other qualities inherent to blockchains, such as the 24/7 schedule that they operate under within the context of trading. Crypto markets don’t close, which can provide both opportunities and risks alike. In April, the Financial Times reported that the New York Stock Exchange was exploring round-the-clock trading. The development would be a significant break from the exchange’s regular six-and-a-half hour trading window, extended as recently as 1985.

Title: Jim Cramer on Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN): ‘I Like It Ahead Of The Quarter, Even Though It Has A Little More Cyclicality Than Most Chip Makers’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm in the process of assembling a complex circuit board - showing the industrial scale the company operates at. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 While Cramer mentioned that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has shown cyclicality, he still likes it ahead of the company reporting its third-quarter earnings on October 22. “After the close, we hear from Texas Instruments. We've been hearing a lot about how semiconductor companies are in the doldrums, the ones without AI, that is. Tex Instruments falls into that category but this company's become much more focused. I like it ahead of the quarter, even though it has a little more cyclicality than most chip makers.” Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is engaged in the design and sale of semiconductors. The company provides a range of products focused on power management, signal processing, and embedded computing, which are utilized across various sectors, including automotive, industrial, personal electronics, and communications. On October 21, TipRanks reported that Susquehanna lowered the price target on the stock to $240 from $250 and maintained a Positive rating. In previewing the upcoming third-quarter results, the firm noted that the semiconductor industry is facing broad-based challenges, particularly in the automotive and industrial segments, where momentum has started to decline. For the personal computer market, there is an expectation for notebook production to rise in 2024, although the pace may slow toward the year’s end, largely due to AI-related devices not driving demand as anticipated. In the handset market, forecasts indicate an increase in smartphone shipments for 2024. Additionally, in the data center segment, recent server evaluations suggest a slightly stronger performance in the latter half of 2024, partly driven by AMD's market share gains. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) management has indicated an awareness that market conditions may not be as favorable as previously thought. In its midyear update to its long-term planning, which is typically conducted once a year, the company maintained its spending plans for 2024 and 2025. However, it revised the outlook for 2026 expenditures, lowering the anticipated range from $5 billion to between $2 billion and $5 billion, contingent on revenue performance at that time. Overall TXN ranks 13th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Reuters) - (This Oct. 18 story has been corrected to say that the NYSE received approval to trade options on 3, not 11 ETFs, in the headline and paragraph 1, to remove references to IBIT and Invesco Galaxy approvals in paragraph 4, and to add a line about CBOE approvals in paragraph 3) The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Separately, Cboe Global also got approval to trade options on two spot bitcoin ETFs, according to a filing. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

In September, it announced the acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, both recognized leaders in healthcare logistics based in Germany. While the financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, these companies bring significant expertise in managing complex healthcare logistics, including a network of temperature-controlled warehousing spanning six temperature zones and a comprehensive cold chain transportation solution across Europe. The acquisition is expected to improve the company's capabilities in meeting the growing demands of healthcare customers who require efficient handling of temperature-sensitive and time-critical shipments. Kate Gutmann, UPS’s Executive Vice President and President of International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, noted that the rapid advancements in the pharmaceutical industry are driving the need for integrated cold and frozen supply chains. She emphasized that Frigo-Trans will expand the company's solution offerings and support the company’s ambition to become the leading provider of complex healthcare logistics globally. On October 10, Wells Fargo raised the price target on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) to $142 from $134 and kept an Overweight rating. Ahead of the third-quarter earnings report, the firm made slight adjustments to its estimates for the fourth quarter but kept its outlook for the third quarter positive.

Title: BlackRock taps into AI frenzy with two new ETFs
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-taps-into-ai-frenzy-with-two-new-etfs-3675383

(Reuters) - Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Tuesday launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aimed at giving investors exposure to the booming market for artificial intelligence. Generative AI, designed to create human-like interactions by processing vast amounts of data, has taken the world by storm and is expected to be integrated into virtually all industries in the coming years from technology to financial services. "As an investing theme, BlackRock views AI as a mega force with broad investing implications both now and in the long term," the world's largest asset manager said. Asset managers have been rolling out thematic ETFs to capitalize on the popularity of certain themes, sectors or trends, unlike traditional products that track broad market indexes. Demand for these products, however, has been mixed in recent months as investors have been opting for funds linked to stock market benchmarks, which are hovering near record highs. BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF will invest in global AI and technology stocks across market capitalizations. Its iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF shares a similar investment objective, aiming for long-term capital appreciation by investing in global technology companies across sectors like semiconductors, software and hardware, among others. "These active ETFs can help investors seize outsized and overlooked investment opportunities across the full stack of AI and advanced technologies," said Tony Kim, BlackRock's head of the fundamental equities technology group. Earlier this month, the asset manager beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and its assets under management (AUM) hit a record high as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows. As of Sept 30, its iShares business - with over 1400 ETFs - had $4.2 trillion in AUM.

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet is this week’s World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | How much World of Warcraft content is too much at one time? The War Within Season 1 continues and we’ve made our second full circuit of all the World Bosses with the return this week of Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time. Orta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin. The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters: As always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.

Business FILE PHOTO: People are seen in front of a showroom that hosts BlackRock in Davos, Switzerland Januar 22, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Asset management giant BlackRock on Tuesday launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aimed at giving investors exposure to the booming market for artificial intelligence. Generative AI, designed to create human-like interactions by processing vast amounts of data, has taken the world by storm and is expected to be integrated into virtually all industries in the coming years from technology to financial services. "As an investing theme, BlackRock views AI as a mega force with broad investing implications both now and in the long term," the world's largest asset manager said. Asset managers have been rolling out thematic ETFs to capitalize on the popularity of certain themes, sectors or trends, unlike traditional products that track broad market indexes. Demand for these products, however, has been mixed in recent months as investors have been opting for funds linked to stock market benchmarks, which are hovering near record highs. BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF will invest in global AI and technology stocks across market capitalizations. Its iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF shares a similar investment objective, aiming for long-term capital appreciation by investing in global technology companies across sectors like semiconductors, software and hardware, among others. "These active ETFs can help investors seize outsized and overlooked investment opportunities across the full stack of AI and advanced technologies," said Tony Kim, BlackRock's head of the fundamental equities technology group. Earlier this month, the asset manager beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and its assets under management (AUM) hit a record high as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows. As of Sept 30, its iShares business - with over 1400 ETFs - had $4.2 trillion in AUM.

NEXT | Halloween brings holiday mayhem to most of Blizzard's games. Here a... It’s patch day for World of Warcraft, so it’s no surprise that there’s a long maintenance today: The War Within servers were scheduled be offline from 7am – 3pm pacific today, but came back online an hour early. The World of Warcraft servers are now live! The servers are now live with with patch 11.0.5, which primarily features WoW’s big birthday bash, but also adds new classes for Dracthyr, new Ascendence forms for Shaman, and a whole lot of class changes for everybody else. WoW’s 20th anniversary celebration is going to be massive, with the new Blackrock Depths raid, vanilla Timewalking dungeons, more world bosses, and a big party outside the Caverns of Time with plenty of prizes to enjoy, including revamped Tier 2 sets. Blizzard hasn’t had a great track record with maintenance during The War Within, which has had an above-average number of long and extended maintenances since launch. However it seems like Blizzard made a reasonable time estimate today, getting the servers online early. Kudos to the server team! Fortunately there’s plenty to do while you wait to download the new patch. There’s always Warcraft Rumble, which is currently in the middle of its Hallow’s End celebrations, and post-expansion Diablo 4 is the best the game has ever been — even if you didn’t buy the expansion — plus the base game is on Xbox Game Pass if you don’t own it, either. There are worse ways to kill a day than by slaughtering demons. For my part, I’m refreshing my knowledge of all things Dragon Age before the next game comes out next week, and there’s plenty of game lore to keep me busy. The servers are now up, so I’ll see you in game soon! Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers. By leaving comments on this site you agree to follow our commenting and community guidelines.

Title: Larry Fink: Supercharge Economy Through Infrastructure, AI Investing

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s annual meeting on Monday, stressed the need for policy makers to address the federal deficit and $36 trillion national debt, pointing to the strength of U.S. capital markets as a way to improve the country’s fiscal woes. “The economy is growing about 3%, but if you take out the excess spending of the federal government [$1.8 trillion deficit], that’s an equivalent of 6% GDP,” Fink said. “The growth is on the back of debt; the growth is not on the back of equity … we are going to have a [debt] crisis.” One way to tackle the deficit, the CEO of the $11.5 trillion asset manager said, is to grow the economy above the trendline by investing in major projects like infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Fink pointed out the billions that AI and data center projects cost, noting that these investments are opportunities for private capital to grow the economy. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  “I’m not frightened of this deficit, but it’s pretty cautionary if we don’t find a way to unlock growth,” Fink said. “This is my message to every politician: We need to be unlocking growth from the private sector, and the U.S. is in the best position of any country in the world because of the scale of our capital markets.” Fink says the way to unlock capitalism and achieve this growth is not to raise or lower taxes, but to make the capital markets more efficient, so that they can provide more funding for more segments of the economy. Permitting reform is needed to clear a major hindrance to building needed infrastructure projects, Fink noted in his remarks: “The permitting process is inhibiting growth, inhibiting opportunity.” Fink also pointed to the role that private credit can play in infrastructure investing. “I think the biggest growth of private credit can be infrastructure credit,” Fink said. “I believe you’re going to see more and more opportunities in all the different shades of credit.” Related Stories: Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter BlackRock’s Purchase of GIP Deepens Its Alts Exposure Gap Narrowing Between Infrastructure Investments and Allocation Targets Tags: AI, BlackRock, data centers, Infrastructure, Larry Fink, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, SIFMA « Rest Super Names Interim Co-CIOs

Title: Michael Saylor’s Latest Remarks Shock The Bitcoin World: What He Said
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-latest-remark-shock-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:30:36Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with journalist Madison Reidy, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, stirred a massive controversy within the Bitcoin community with his remarks on custody and regulation. The discussion centered around the risks associated with large institutions holding significant amounts of BTC and the potential for government seizure or confiscation, reminiscent of historical events like the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 in 1933. When questioned about the risks of having a significant amount of BTC held by third-party custodians and large institutions, Saylor dismissed concerns of increased seizure or confiscation. He argued that BTC is safer in the hands of regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JP Morgan than with unregulated private holders. Saylor suggested that when Bitcoin is held by “crypto anarchists” who operate outside of government regulations and tax systems, it poses a greater risk of government intervention. “I think it’s the opposite. I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” He emphasized that regulated institutions provide stability and trustworthiness. “When you have regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, and State Street Bank holding the asset, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms are invested in those entities. There’s no way that all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets from Fidelity and BlackRock or Vanguard because that’s where all their retirement money is invested.” Reidy brought up the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 during the Great Depression as a historical precedent for potential government seizure. Saylor dismissed this comparison, labeling it a “myth and a trope” propagated by paranoid “crypto anarchists.” He contended that the circumstances are fundamentally different because, at that time, the US was on the gold standard, and the government needed to control gold to devalue the dollar. “Today, we’re not on the gold standard or the Bitcoin standard,” Saylor stated. He argued that the US government has no incentive to seize BTC held in custody any more than it would seize stocks or real estate. “I don’t think we have to worry about Bitcoin held in custody being seized by the government any more than you have to worry about your Apple stock being seized by the government,” Saylor claimed. Saylor’s remarks did not sit well with many in the Bitcoin community, who value decentralization and self-custody as core principles. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, responded on X: “Calling self-custody ‘crypto-anarchism’ oversimplifies what Bitcoin accomplishes. It’s about freedom—freedom of speech, property rights, and protecting your right to own what’s yours. We must not dismiss it because freedom isn’t promised—it must be fought for and protected.” He acknowledged his respect for Saylor but emphasized the importance of diverse views in a free market. “My goal is simply to defend the principles that I believe make Bitcoin powerful: freedom and the ability for anyone to engage with it however they see fit,” Mallers added. Sina Nader, co-founder of 21st Capital, criticized Saylor’s position: “Terrible look for Saylor to become a shill for the government and banking system and call true Bitcoiners paranoid. Saylor is on a mission to relegate Bitcoin into an investment pet rock and halt its usage as a currency.” Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, warned: “A government doesn’t need to physically confiscate your Bitcoin. It can just lock custodial BTC into approved custodians forever, aka ‘Institutional Bitcoin.’ While a government that isn’t on a Bitcoin Standard technically shouldn’t have incentive to confiscate BTC, it actually does still have an incentive to degrade and attack Bitcoin.” Mow suggested that governments might seek to undermine Bitcoin because it represents a “harder and superior money” that could diminish the value of fiat currencies. He urged the community to “plan accordingly” with a self-custody solution and “expect [a] 6102,” referencing the historical executive order. At press time, BTC traded at $67,707.

Title: Researchers say Arkansas may have 19M tons of lithium critical for battery power

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/22/2024 6:26:16 AM PDT by Red Badger Researchers said in a recent article that Arkansas may have 19 million tons of lithium, which is used in rechargeable batteries for important products like phones and electric cars. The researchers said in their article released last month in the journal Science Advances they had “calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas,” making up “35 to 136% of the current US lithium resource estimate.” According to a Monday release from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), “the Smackover Formation is a relic of an ancient sea that left an extensive, porous, and permeable limestone geologic unit that extends under parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.” Lithium, which has been labeled by the USGS as a critical mineral, has been often obtained from brines or salt flats they evaporate into. According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] To: Leaning Right; stanne Yes indeed. But “progressives” don’t really care about that. They only care that it is not done in their backyard. Out of sight, out of mind. IMHO, most of them are scared to be the one to break the narrative. As an EV owner and solar owner (not because of warmageddon fears, but because I'm trying to be more self-reliant and I can produce my own power a lot easier than I can produce my own gasoline), I sometimes meet other EV owners if I take the EV on a trip and charge away from home. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone thanked me for saving the world or such. I usually show them the graph below and tell them that we'd all freak out if we knew what went into making EV's. Sometimes they say, "but who could I tell that would believe me". Fun topic: If I'm in the south when this conversation happens, which means in the Bible Belt, I point out that the Minoan Warm Period mirrors the Era of Judges, Greek Dark Age cooling period mirrors the Era of Kings, and the Christ and the Apostles lived during the Roman Warm Period. Because they are fellow Bible believers, those are the few EV owners who I've been able to educate that the Modern Warm Period is not the freakazoid unique thing that leftists make it out to be. Most of them still fear warmageddon. But a few of them said I made them rethink their cult religion to come back to believing more in God and the Bible. 18 posted on 10/22/2024 7:00:06 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

Title: AI datacentres take the nuclear option
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/ai-datacentres-take-the-nuclear-option-51577/

Full Content:
Oct 22, 2024 A model of a small modular reactor designed by X-energy. Source: Amazon. The power and utility of AI, be it unimodal or multimodal, is ultimately limited by the volume, and quality, of the data that is scraped, stored and manipulated to provide relevant and useful outputs to end users. The immense quantity of data required for AI systems to operate increases with every minute of every day, seemingly ad infinitum, and that in turn is putting increasing pressure on the resources required to support that data processing. Nuclear power, it seems, is one of the ways to relieve some of that pressure. The data underpinning generative AI (GenAI) has to be stored and processed somewhere, and that means construction of bigger datacentres around the world, all of which have to access power sufficient to keep them cool (literally!), calm and collected. Datacentres are very expensive to build, operate and manage, and it is increasingly obvious that the current model supporting GenAI is becoming unsustainable and will have to be replaced: That will come at gigantic cost and huge disruption but there will be no option in the medium to long term. The data warehouses that enable the likes of ChatGPT are on the verge of exceeding their feasible size limits, Mark Russinovich, CTO at Microsoft Azure, told the Semafor news website recently, and he’s not alone. What is needed with some urgency, according to Russinovich, is a new model and method of connecting multiple datacentres so that they can handle the practically inordinate processing load that will characterise future generations of the GenAI we now take for granted and the emergence of the still-undefined and theoretical artificial general intelligence (AGI) of the future that may be capable of exceeding the intellectual capabilities of humanity – see Is multimodal AI a dead-end on the road to AGI? AGI is a long way away, and may never be realised, and as things stand today with the model we have and seem to be stuck with, even the most advanced AI is centred on large language models (LLMs) that are trained in datacentre facilities running hundreds of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) that can be chained to run as a single gigantic computer. Datacentre annual global energy consumption to double in the next five years All of this requires astonishing levels of power. Research firm IDC expects global datacentre electricity consumption to more than double between 2023 and 2028, notching up a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% over the five-year period to reach 857 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2028. (1TWh is 1 billion kilowatt hours, roughly the equivalent of power sufficient to fully light 1 million average homes 24 hours a day for a full year.) The amount of power required to perform massive AI operations is already putting immense strain on the ageing and often neglected national grid in the US, which is home to most of the world’s hyperscale datacentres. The available megawattage devoted to datacentre operations is at its peak and that is causing all manner of problems for the utility firms and the datacentre sector. According to the analyst house RystadEnergy, headquartered in Oslo, Norway, since 2010 total US electricity demand has been relatively stable at some 4,000 TWh but it is changing as the proliferation of giant datacentres and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) drive demand for the extra generation of electricity. RystadEnergy’s research shows that the two sectors will add 290 TWh of new power demand by 2030. RystadEnergy adds that electricity demand for datacentres and the chip foundries that provide them with GPU microprocessors will increase cumulative demand by 177 TWh between 2023 to 2030, reaching a total of 307 TWh from the 130TWh required in 2023. Meanwhile, global management consultancy, Bain and Company, has published a report showing that “surging datacentre power consumption could require more than $2tn in new energy generation resources worldwide. Furthermore, US energy demand could outstrip supply within the next few years; meeting demand would require utilities to boost annual generation by up to 26% by 2028.” That would be a huge task. The report adds: “Facing potentially overwhelming demand from datacentres, US utilities are grappling with a challenge few executives anticipated: After years of navigating flat or shrinking demand, many organisations have forgotten what it takes to grow. What’s more, they’re finding that capitalising on this new opportunity will require a rapid, unprecedented transformation of their operating and business models.” It continues: “For nearly two decades, efficiency and operational nimbleness were paramount while US electricity demand plateaued as a result of advances in energy efficiency and distributed generation offsetting economic growth. But the era of stagnant demand is over. The late 2022 breakthrough in generative AI and the ensuing datacentre boom blindsided utilities just as demand was also rising because of repatriated manufacturing, industrial policy, and vehicle electrification. “Now, US utilities are bracing for demand to outstrip supply during the next few years, with datacentres accounting for the bulk of the increase. Supply, both in generation and transmission, will take years to catch up… by 2028, utilities would need to increase annual energy generation by between 7% and 26% above the 2023 total to meet projected demand. That’s far beyond the largest five-year generation boost of about 5% that US utilities achieved from 2005 through 2023.” The report also finds that datacentre annual global energy consumption could “double by 2027 from 2023 levels, growing at a compound annual rate of 10% to 24% and potentially surpassing 1 million gigawatt hours in 2027 [even greater than IDC’s projection]. Serving a 1-gigawatt datacentre requires the capacity of about four natural gas plants or around half of a large nuclear plant.” The Biden administration, well aware of the looming crisis in the US grid, passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which set aside $3bn for AI infrastructure such as new power cables, but that sum is a drop in the ocean of the investment required. To put things into perspective, in partnership with the US-headquartered BlackRock, Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, with $10tn to call on, Microsoft has launched its own $30bn AI infrastructure fund. The company has also been negotiating the re-opening of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant – yes, the one that went into partial ‘China Syndrome’ meltdown back in March 1979 – and simultaneously is working to form partnerships to foster green energy initiatives. The problem is urgent and daunting. Google says its first small modular reactor (SMR) will be in place and working by 2030 In his interview with Semafor, Microsoft Azure’s Russinovich said one answer to the problem might be constructing datacentres in multiple locations so as to spread the load across the power grids of different cities or regions. In a masterpiece of understatement he said, “It would be technically challenging, but it may be necessary. I think it’s inevitable, especially when you get to the kind of scale that these things are getting to.” However, connecting datacentre networks across long distances is fraught with problems, not least because maintaining the speed of AI data transfer across painstakingly synchronised fibre optic cable would be of paramount importance. The greater the distance, the higher the possibility that faults and mistimings would arise. Certainly, datacentres are trying to reduce their energy consumption. For example, many are migrating from pumped air systems to liquid-cooling processes but even liquid cooling draws a huge amount of power from the grid and is financially inefficient beyond a certain size. The only solution in the short to medium term appears to be nuclear power, and in the absence of any breakthrough in the quest for nuclear fusion, nuclear fission it will be, along with its attendant problems and dangers. In a recent blog, Google announced it had reached “the world’s first corporate agreement” to “purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to be developed by Kairos Power” of California. Water is used as a coolant in conventional nuclear reactors, but Kairos Power reactors use molten fluoride salts instead. The salts have exceptional chemical stability and a great capacity for transferring heat at high temperature and the ability to retain fission products. Many studies have shown that molten fluoride salts are compatible with conventional high-temperature structural materials, such as stainless steel, and are ideal in terms of reliability and a long-operational life in a commercial environment. The initial phase will see the first Kairos Power’s SMRs in situ and operational by 2030. Thereafter, additional reactors will be deployed at intervals until 2035. Google says the deal “will enable up to 500 MW of new 24/7 carbon-free power to US electricity grids and help more communities benefit from clean and affordable nuclear power.” Google’s announcement was quickly followed by news from Amazon that it has “signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects – including enabling the construction of several new small modular reactors.” In Washington state it has struck an agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, for the development of four advanced SMRs, while Amazon is also making an investment in X-energy, a developer of next-generation SMR reactors and fuel: X-energy’s advanced nuclear reactor design will be used in the Energy Northwest project. In addition, Amazon has signed an agreement with utility company Dominion Energy in Virginia, where many large datacentres are located, to “explore the development of an SMR project near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. This will bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region, where Dominion projects that power demands will increase by 85% over the next 15 years,” noted Amazon. Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: “Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040. One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon free and able to scale – which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon. Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.” It’s not an instant solution to a very pressing problem, but it is a start. – Martyn Warwick, Editor in Chief, TelecomTV Oct 23, 2024 Oct 23, 2024 Oct 23, 2024 Oct 23, 2024 Oct 22, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Mineral rights royalties are a form of passive income generated by companies that extract resources such as oil or gas from fund-owned properties. Energy market analytics company RBN Energy estimates that mineral and royalty interests amount to $700 billion. Qualified retail and institutional investors can browse tokenized mineral rights-based funds, invest in them and review their portfolio’s performance directly on the platform, Elmnts said Tuesday in a statement. The company said funds on Elmnts will offer double-digit yields, with minimum investments set at $1,000. The platform has launched with one fund, with plans to add more soon. “Our vision is to bring liquidity and accessibility to high-yielding assets that are otherwise hard to access,” Elmnts Chief Product Officer James Pacheco told Decrypt. “Mineral rights are a perfect example—they generate predictable, long-term income through oil and gas royalties, but very few people even know they exist, much less how to participate.” The Solana project will be available “virtually everywhere,” access to certain funds could differ based on the client's country of residence, Pacheco said. Tokenized investment funds’ popularity has skyrocketed in recent months, inspiring the creation of new funds based on all kinds of tokenized tangible assets. BlackRock last spring launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund based on tokenized US Treasury Bills — the largest tokenized investment fund as of publication time with more than $550 million assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Guggenheim Treasury Securities partnered with blockchain technology firm Zeconomy in September to launch a fund based on digital commercial paper, while Midas earlier this month launched two tokenized investment products based on mTBill and mBasis, respectively.

NEXT | What could be coming in The War Within patch 11.1? World of Warcraft‘s 20th anniversary event is nearly here, and if that made you feel ancient, it’s probably time for an annual checkup; also, go drink some water. We’re getting tons of content for the anniversary event — blast levels on alts with the 20% buff, revisit the Blackrock Depths with Moira Thaurissan, blast through classic dungeons, earn some truly fantastic rewards (including a beautiful blue phoenix), and more. But does it mean ignoring regularly scheduled content? Now, The War Within Season 1 started about six weeks ago — certainly long enough for big-name guilds to clear Mythic Nerub-ar Palace and/or earn Keystone Master (if not Keystone Hero) by now, right? Well, a large portion of the player base (my guild included) is still progressing in through Heroic for Ahead of the Curve, and we’ll probably be working on it for a while longer. Does this mean anniversary content is a distraction from progression? Not really. Blackrock Depths and Classic Timewalking should be a source of equivalent upgrades — you’re not missing out on gear by running the limited-time content. Additionally, the chance to earn Tier 2 appearances and a collection of cosmetics matching Blizzard Service Awards is a delight for any transmog fiend. The War Within will still be there when the celebration wraps up, ready to pull me back into its spidery embrace (ew). Having this many choices isn’t a bad problem. The anniversary event is super exciting and marks 18 years in Azeroth for me (yes, my account is old enough to vote). It’s just also hard to remember in the face of anticipatory FOMO and choice paralysis that WoW is a game I play for fun at the end of the day, and I should do what activities I enjoy without agonizing over missing out. Either way, the content machine grinds forward and drags us along whether or not we’re ready. TWW Season 2 will be here before we know it, even if it seems like we just started Season 1! Enjoy the anniversary, play what brings you happiness, and remember to take a few deep breaths somewhere in there if you start panicking because video games are not worth that level of stress.

Title: Sexual abuse of children by priests was known ‘at all levels’ in Catholic Church, says Archbishop of Dublin

The sexual abuse of children by priests was blamed on survivors and there was “no effort made to deal with the perpetrators”, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Dermot Farrell has said. The archbishop made his remarks on clerical abuse in an interview with a US conservative Catholic TV network. Of the perpetrators of the abuse, he said: “Sometimes they were left in situ, sometimes they were moved around, because there was maybe a thinking the problem was the person they were involved with rather than with the actual perpetrators,” he said. “So if you moved them somewhere else that’ll deal with the problem. They were putting the blame on the survivor,” he said. “We know different now but then, because there was a sexual element in it, they [church authorities] didn’t want to deal with that. That was part of the, maybe, the shame that they wouldn’t actually deal with it or make it known. They kept it secret and it was very secretive.” He said there was “a culture of denial, a culture of covering up, a culture of silencing, ignoring. Nobody would accept it. The other thing, it was endemic in society”. Archbishop Farrell was speaking in a report on the US conservative Catholic EWTN (Eternal World Television Network), titled Survivors of Sexual Abuse Speak Out in Ireland. The report included an interview with Blackrock abuse survivor David Ryan. Archbishop Farrell told reporter Colm Flynn that clerical child sex abuse “was known at all levels [in the church]”. “Yes, I think that in the case of priests, some of their colleagues knew about it, were aware, at least suspicious that something wasn’t right. Certainly, we know bishops knew about it, because they were the people who moved somebody from A to B. There was a fortress mentality, protect the church first, people closed ranks, and there were serial perpetrators.” He agreed that [for clergy] the accountability bar was higher. “Absolutely. You’ve high moral values, there’s the integrity, there’s the hypocrisy, so all of those things come into play. There is a higher standard expected of the ministers of the Catholic Church.” Where the church in general was concerned “we’ve got to face up to it as all the baptised, listening to the stories, understanding the stories, accepting the truth of those stories,” he said. “In our own case we have compensated victims that have come forward and we try to settle all of those cases as quickly and expeditiously as possible. I think the religious orders, if they knew about cases and they came forward, have settled many of those cases,” he said. Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor Hits Minefield with Bitcoin Statements – Nurse, Administer a Dose of OG Bitcoining

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. You know how Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy CEO) praised self-custody when FTX crashed in 2022? We do. And so does everyone else. He said self-custody is essential to preventing powerful, unchecked custodians from abusing your trust and mismanaging your funds. He also dismissed fears of state-sanctioned $BTC seizures as ‘paranoid crypto-anarchism.’ Did the crypto community grab the pitchforks? You bet they did, most of them, at least. Let’s see what prompted Saylor to make these statements. Michael Saylor, the CEO of the largest corporate Bitcoin holder (252,220 $BTC), said some things in an interview with Madison Reidy on YouTube that riled up the crypto community. He suggested two things: The second point mostly referred to ‘paranoid crypto-anarchists’ who genuinely believe state-sanctioned Bitcoin seizures could become a thing. But is that all he said? Of course not. The overarching context was a bit more nuanced, so here’s the reasoning behind his claims: In Saylor’s view, the benefits of custodial Bitcoin safekeeping (aka banks) far outweigh the risks (such as relying on trusted intermediaries to remain honest). But is that actually true? The community was fairly vocal about Saylor, with many criticizing his approach. Sina (founder of 21st Capital, a Bitcoin custody and security firm) was among his detractors. We believe the risks aren’t as ‘minimal’ as he makes them seem. So, we summarized the community’s counterpoints (and added our own) to Michael Saylor’s arguments. In the end, the risks seem more than worth considering. During the interview, Saylor seemed to dismiss them and focused on the benefits of custodial Bitcoin ownership. Simon Dixon (author of ‘Bank to the Future’ and OG Bitcoiner) speculated on Saylor’s 180-degree shift from self-custody maximalist to ‘bank lover.’ He said self-custody would go against MicroStrategy’s long-term vision of becoming a Bitcoin bank to offer collateralized loans. To us, Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its decentralized, self-custodial nature. It’s this vision that built blockchains and cryptocurrencies as we know (and love) them today. Large institutions controlling Bitcoin just doesn’t sound safe or privacy-friendly. But Michael Saylor might have a point in that institutional adoption is key to Bitcoin’s success.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/22/2024 4:57:23 AM PDT by MtnClimber After 9/11, the federal government enacted the Patriot Act to protect citizens and the country from further terrorist attacks. But in what some people would call an extreme reaction, Congress passed a bill that essentially put all Americans under surveillance: It also beefed up the Bank Secrecy Act, giving Washington greater oversight over everyone in the U.S. financial system -- which amounts to pretty much everyone in the country. And it mandated that banks collect more data on their customers -- also known as ‘know-your customer protocols’” -- and report any suspicious activities. Over the years, this machinery, which had in theory been created to stop terrorists from harming Americans, shifted its focus to Americans themselves. And it has shown up in a process called “debanking”: Debanking is an attempt by major financial institutions, those with assets of more than $100 billion, to close the accounts of organizations or individuals with whom they disagree, whether politically or religiously. This growing and disturbing trend denies individuals, businesses, and non-profits access to financial services. One of the most aggressive banks carrying out debanking is JPMorgan Chase. Not only are their actions egregious, but their demands on one client for keeping the account open were invasive and inappropriate. One of the organizations that was targeted was the National Committee for Religious Freedom (NCRF), which defends the rights of citizens to practice their faith freely. When NCRF found out from a depositor that the account was restricted and marked for closure, they tried to investigate the bank’s actions, but bank staff were unable to disclose information: (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

Title: BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Draws In Gargantuan $329 Million Inflow Despite BTC’s Sharp Pullback From $69K
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-draws-in-gargantuan-329-million-inflow-despite-btcs-sharp-pullback-from-69k/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T11:42:54Z
Full Content:
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, attracted $329 million in inflows on Oct. 21 for its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). iShares Bitcoin Trust’s large daily inflow took place alongside a tumble in the Bitcoin price following a failed challenge of the $70,000 level. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. registered total net inflows of $294.3 million on Monday, exceeding the positive flows that continued over the past week. The inflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which recorded $329 million in inflows yesterday, according to data from Farside Investors. Notably, a whopping $1.5 billion of fresh capital went into the fund in the last six days. Becoming comical now…iShares Bitcoin ETF has taken in *$1.5bil* over past 6 trading days.That $1.5bil alone would make it a top 5 launch of 2024 (out of 570 ETFs).But of course… it’s taken in a total of *$23bil* since January.Are there really still naysayers out there? https://t.co/UjBGugg0Zx The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF to post an inflow of $5.9 million. In contrast, others fell out of investor favor, posting zero or negative flows. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, IBIT recorded the third-biggest ETF inflows in 2024, surpassing Vanguard and BlackRock’s S&P 500 index funds. Cumulatively, total net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs have reached $21.3 billion. And that’s even accounting for the $20.05 billion that has exited from Grayscale’s GBTC, Farside numbers show. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of nearly $74K just two months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January after a decade of rejections. Notably, investors and traders in the United States feel more bullish that a Donald Trump presidency is likely. The former President and Republican presidential nominee is taking another shot at the Oval Office — and is passionately pro-crypto. His rival Kamala Harris has been much slower in embracing the crypto sector. Bitcoin briefly peeped above the elusive $69,000 mark on Monday before swiftly falling below $67,000. The alpha crypto has since slightly recovered, hovering at $67,162 as of press time, representing a 1.7% drop on a 24-hour basis.

Title: Canadian Solar faces patent lawsuit from Trina Solar
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/canadian-solar-faces-patent-lawsuit-from-trina-solar-93CH-3674802
Time Published: 2024-10-22T11:08:52Z
Full Content:
GUELPH, ON - Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:CSIQ), a leading global solar technology company, is currently involved in a legal dispute following a patent infringement complaint filed by Trina Solar Co., Ltd., a competitor in the solar industry. The complaint, submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on October 8, 2024, accuses Canadian Solar's U.S. subsidiaries of infringing on two U.S. patents related to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar photovoltaic module technology. Canadian Solar, recognized as one of the world's largest solar product manufacturers, has a diverse portfolio that includes TOPCon solar modules. The company has an extensive patent library with thousands of patents in various jurisdictions for solar cells and related technologies. Adam Walters, General Counsel, Americas for Canadian Solar's Modules and Systems Solutions business, stated, "Canadian Solar respects and takes very seriously its own intellectual property rights and those of third parties. In our view, this is a frivolous lawsuit, and we expect the court will find that our proprietary TOPCon technology does not infringe on the patents claimed by Trina." Despite the ongoing litigation, Canadian Solar reassures that it will continue to provide high-quality solar products in the U.S. and internationally, a commitment it has upheld for over two decades since its establishment. Canadian Solar has a significant presence in the renewable energy sector, having delivered over 133 GW of solar photovoltaic modules globally. Since 2010, the company has also developed and connected approximately 11 GWp of solar power projects and 3.7 GWh of battery energy storage projects. It currently operates 1.6 GWp of solar power projects, with 6.5 GWp under construction or in backlog, and 20.9 GWp in advanced and early-stage pipeline. Additionally, Canadian Solar has a considerable battery energy storage project pipeline totaling around 63 GWh. The company, listed on NASDAQ since 2006, is considered one of the most bankable in the solar and renewable energy industry. This press release statement serves as the basis for the information provided herein. In other recent news, Canadian Solar faced a downgrade from Citi due to concerns about US market risks and tariffs. The company's stock was downgraded from Neutral to Sell, with a significant reduction in the price target. Canadian Solar's photovoltaic module business in the United States, currently the only profitable market for the company, faces uncertainties due to high countervailing duty rates and potential political implications. Additionally, the company's storage margin outlook has been revised, forecasting mid-teen margins as opposed to the previously anticipated 20%. On a positive note, Canadian Solar's subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, secured a $500 million investment from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), aimed at bolstering project development initiatives in the renewable energy sector. This investment is expected to enhance the company's capacity to expand its solar project portfolio. Despite robust second-quarter results with solar module shipments reaching 8.2 gigawatts and revenues of $1.6 billion, the company's third-quarter revenue and gross margin guidance fell short of expectations. This led to a downward revision of its full-year 2024 revenue guidance. Analyst firms Roth/MKM and JPMorgan adjusted their outlooks on Canadian Solar, reducing their price targets while maintaining their respective ratings. These adjustments were influenced by a mixed financial performance. The company's diversified business model, including a rapidly expanding energy storage segment, is expected to contribute to future growth. These are recent developments in the company's performance and outlook. As Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) navigates this legal challenge, investors should consider some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. Despite the company's significant market presence, its financial performance has been mixed. According to InvestingPro data, Canadian Solar's market capitalization stands at $835.64 million, with a Price to Book ratio of 0.31 as of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024. This low P/B ratio, highlighted as an InvestingPro Tip, suggests the stock might be undervalued relative to its book value, potentially offering a value opportunity for investors amidst the legal uncertainty. However, the company faces some financial headwinds. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that Canadian Solar is quickly burning through cash, which could be a concern given the potential legal expenses. Additionally, the company's revenue declined by 18.28% in the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, with analysts anticipating further sales decline in the current year. On a positive note, Canadian Solar remains profitable, with a P/E ratio of 22.91. The company's gross profit for the last twelve months ending Q2 2024 was $1,072.49 million, although its gross profit margin of 16.47% is relatively low for the industry. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Canadian Solar, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Time Published: 2024-10-22T09:31:49Z
Full Content:
At the NDTV World Summit, the conversation on women's inclusion in India's energy, logistics, and entrepreneurial sectors took centre stage with a sharp focus on the "3As" - Access, Ambition, and Attainment - as key drivers for advancing women in leadership roles. Preeti Bajaj, CEO & MD of Luminous Power Technologies, talked about the tangible impact of increasing women's representation at the leadership level. "At Luminous Power Technologies, the senior leadership team constitutes 33 per cent women, really making a difference, all day, every day," she said, before detailing the "3As" framework. Besides Preeti Bajaj, business leaders and entrepreneurs, including Kami Viswanathan (President, Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and Africa at FedEx), and Padmaja Ruparel (Co-founder, IAN Group), discussed how women are not only breaking barriers but also setting new standards in leadership, innovation, and inclusivity. Despite India's entrepreneurial boom, the growth of women entrepreneurs remains alarmingly low. Speaking on the subject, Padmaja Ruparel said, "In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of the funding went to women. In 2023, it dropped to a mere 9.7 per cent." Ms Ruparel called for stronger financial backing of women-led ventures, stating, "We need to create the BlackRock of India led by a woman. That, to me, is what will drive entrepreneurship." Kami Viswanathan of FedEx said that 36 per cent of the company's board and 26 per cent of management globally are women. "We recently added the opportunity to DEI to rededicate ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths," she said.

Title: Bonds Are Selling Off Everywhere as Traders Rethink Fed Pathway

(Bloomberg) -- Bonds extended losses as investors mulled the prospect of slower US interest-rate cuts, a trend that risks upending debt positions everywhere. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Transportation Policy Gets Left Behind in Presidential Race Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives The selloff pushed yields on two-year Treasuries higher by as much as two basis points on Tuesday, while 10-year yields briefly topped 4.2% for the first time since July. The rate on 10-year German securities touched the highest level since early September. The rout also spread to Asia, where the yield on Australian benchmark debt surged as much as 16 basis points. US yields subsequently retreated to little-changed levels. At the heart of the selloff lies a reassessment of the outlook for US monetary policy. Traders are paring back bets on aggressive easing given the US economy remains robust and Fed officials this week sounded a cautious tone over the pace of future rate decreases. Rising oil prices and the prospect of bigger fiscal deficits after the upcoming US presidential election are only compounding the market’s concerns. “With less than two weeks now until the US elections, concerns about the fiscal outlook and its potential upward pressure on inflation have become more acute,” said Robert Dishner, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in London. The US 10-year yield rose 10 basis points on Monday. The move steepened a part of the US yield curve that’s been inverted since late 2022, with the gap between three-month and 10-year yields reaching the narrowest level in nearly two years. “We will see 4.5% probably early next year” for US 10-year yields, said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Traders have pared the extent of expected Fed interest-rate cuts through September 2025 by more than 10 basis points since the end of last week, according to swap pricing, which implies a Fed target rate of 3.50%-3.75%. Apollo Management is among those who’ve said the central bank could keep rates unchanged at its next meeting, while T. Rowe Price sees US 10-year yields climbing to 5% next year on risks of shallower rate cuts and as growth improves. What Bloomberg Strategists say... “Treasuries may struggle in the coming months, with a strong upward bias for yields as the US economy stays resilient and supply concerns grow” Garfield Reynolds, Markets Live strategist The outlook is also being repriced across other markets. Swaps are signaling the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut its benchmark rate cut by only about 50 basis points through to the end of August next year, half of what was priced in after the September policy meeting. Similarly, traders brought forward their forecast for the next Bank of Japan rate hike to June, compared with later than July seen last month. Demand for long-term holdings of Japanese 10-year bonds, “which carry relatively high interest-rate risk, is likely to be limited” in this environment, Keisuke Tsuruta, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo, wrote in a research note. Not everyone expects the selloff to gain momentum. The Fed and Reserve Bank of New Zealand, among others, are in the midst of rate-cutting cycles, which should generate an underlying bid for bonds. “We probably see a slight correction from here,” said Lucinda Haremza, vice president of fixed-income sales at Mizuho Securities in Singapore. There’s “risk of a stronger rally on rising Middle-East tensions or a Harris election win,” she said, referring to the US presidential election contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. For now though, the combination of US debt supply, election hedging and markets front-running the risks of a Republican “red sweep” at the polls may see larger-than-usual fluctuations in Treasuries. Treasury volatility has climbed to the highest level this year, based on the ICE BofA Move Index that tracks anticipated swings in US yields based on options. BlackRock Investment Institute is among those underweight shorter-maturity Treasuries. “We don’t think the Fed will cut rates as sharply as markets expect,” strategists at the company including Wei Li wrote in a note. An aging workforce, persistent budget deficits and the impact of structural shifts such as geopolitical fragmentation should “keep inflation and policy rates higher over the medium term,” they wrote. --With assistance from Haslinda Amin, Anchalee Worrachate and Alice Gledhill.

Title: BlackRock's Larry Fink says the US election 'really doesn't matter' for markets

Larry Fink doesn't think the US election will affect markets much. The BlackRock CEO doubled down on saying the outcome of the US election, which will be decided in two weeks, won't matter in the long run. "I'm tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime," Fink told a conference hosted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association on Monday, in remarks reported by The Financial Times. "The reality is over time, it doesn't matter," he added. He said that BlackRock works with both administrations and is "having conversations" with both Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Fink reiterated his comments from an interview earlier this month, when he said that US elections rarely make a big impact on markets. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets via passive and active strategies, has ties and conflicts to both parties. Trump has invested in BlackRock funds, campaign finance forms showed. Since winning the last election in 2020, President Joe Biden has stocked his administration with BlackRock alumni, including Adewale Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, and Mike Pyle, Vice President Harris' chief economic advisor. Both previously worked in the Obama administration. The firm has also come under fire from both sides of the aisle. Republicans have repeatedly accused BlackRock of "woke investing," a term they used to describe the company's environmental, social, and governance-focused investment strategies. ESG is a broadly-used term among most global investors. In July, House Republicans began an investigation into ESG investing. The committee has subpoenaed BlackRock and other investors as it seeks information on what it calls "collusive agreements to promote and adopt left-wing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals." In 2023, Fink said he was ditching the use of the acronym because of how "weaponized" and political it had become. Last year, a bipartisan House committee began looking into BlackRock's investments in China, for their stakes in Chinese companies blacklisted over claims of supporting China's military or alleged human rights abuses. Fink is not the only Wall Street heavyweight saying the election won't matter to financial markets. In an interview in May, Mike Gitlin, CEO of the $2.7 trillion investing giant Capital Group, said that over the long term, markets climb higher regardless of who wins, and he doesn't agree with rebalancing a portfolio because of election outcomes. But many investors continue to monitor the election closely. In a survey of 400 institutional investors released by asset manager PGIM last week, most investors surveyed agreed that elections influenced how they allocated funds in their portfolios. The institutional managers flagged national debt, economic growth, and immigration reform as their three biggest election concerns. Jump to

Title: Four month scoliosis ‘active’ surgery list to drop from to 20 at the end of year, says Stephen Donnelly

Stephen Donnelly The number of children with scoliosis needing spinal surgery on the active waiting list for longer than four months by the end of this year will fall to 20- down from 86 at the start of the 2024, according to new projections today. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly is expected to brief the Cabinet on the latest waiting lists for children with scoliosis and say some have already had surgery abroad since the summer. The delays have been among the long-running hurdles to be tackled during this term as minister, He is expected to say the projected reductions in surgical waiting times are being achieved in spite of an increase in additions to the surgical list due to significantly higher numbers of outpatient clinics being held. During the summer Children’s Health Ireland (CHI) which oversees children’s hospitals began a new programme to outsource children who are suitable to hospitals here as well as in the UK and USA. Twenty children were passed for treatment abroad, as of September 2024. Hospitals which are part of the plan include Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York, Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, and Portland Hospital UK. . He said “any child who does travel for surgery is supported by a seamless and comprehensive support package, to include flights, accommodation, travel insurance, and funding to cover expenses. CHI and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh (NOHC) are due to perform 557 procedures this year, an increase of 93 compared to 2023. Initiatives are also underway at the Mater University Hospital and Blackrock Clinic. Mr Donnelly is due to say there has been a significant increase in the number of outpatients being seen, with 335 patients scheduled across seven clinics since April 2024, in addition to the patients who are being seen at existing clinics. He will acknowledge some children are still waiting too long for care, but “that any child on the active wait list for longer four months after Christmas , who is deemed clinically suitable and fit t travel , will in consultation with their treating clinician, be offered surgery overseas. The children’s hospitals are hiring additional surgeons and “staff being hired will ensure enough surgical capacity to meet the needs of the service in future, once the current backlog is addressed.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Analysis-Investors flee thematic ETFs as stock benchmarks soar
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisinvestors-flee-thematic-etfs-as-stock-benchmarks-soar-3674270

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors are leaving exchange-traded funds tied to specific themes, such as artificial intelligence and video gaming, as they flock to funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks that are hitting record highs. The run for the exits, however, may slow if the broader market stumbles. While flows in equity ETFs overall continue to climb, thematic ETFs, which invest in companies tied to everything from solar energy to robotics and millennial consumers, are on pace for their third-consecutive year of net outflows, according to financial data and analysis company Morningstar. The category, which has total assets of $108 billion, has lost $5.8 billion in investor capital this year, greater outflows than the $4.8 billion for all of 2023, according to Morningstar. "It's winter for thematic ETFs right now," said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs, an asset-management firm focused on this category. Returns from broad market indexes are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. The S&P 500, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has climbed over 22% this year, propelled by gains from influential stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The five-largest ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, another equity benchmark, have seen inflows of $170 billion this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY) on Thursday became the first ETF to reach $600 billion in assets. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out," said Aniket Ullal, ETF analyst at CFRA, a market-research firm. BAD TIMING Part of the challenge, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar, is the nature of thematic investing itself. Investors often mistime investing in themes, according to a Morningstar study that found investors in thematic ETFs missed out on two-thirds of their returns in a five-year period. "You have to pick the right theme, then be sure that the fund has picked the stocks that will benefit most from that theme, and then be right about the timing of when you buy the fund," Armour said. "Getting that trifecta right is tough." Even some AI-themed ETFs with outsized exposure to market-darling Nvidia have struggled to retain assets. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has seen net outflows of $89 million in the last 12 months, according to the firm. Despite the fund having nearly 13% of its portfolio in the AI chipmaker - almost double the S&P 500 weighting - it has performed only in line with the index, with both up about 39% in the past year. "We still have longer-term conviction in themes," said Arelis Agosto, head of thematics at Global X, which has seen outflows in 19 of its 31 thematic funds over the last 12 months. "We take a long-term view." Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which invests in companies promising "disruptive innovation," has seen $2.6 billion in outflows in 2024, the most of the thematic ETFs, according to Morningstar. The fund is down more than 9% this year. The fact that thematic funds tend to levy higher fees can diminish their appeal. Thematic ETFs' fees average 0.62% of money invested while the average ETF fee is 0.49%. Investors pay 0.09% to own the State Street (NYSE:STT) S&P 500 ETF and 0.03% for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, according to Morningstar. The number of thematic launches dropped to 13 this year from 39 in 2023, while closures of thematic funds in 2024 have already topped 2023's total, with 36 compared to 32, according to Morningstar. Themes ETFs is bucking that trend, having launched 18 products since December, including a Transatlantic Defense ETF, which invests in defense companies based in NATO member states, and a European Luxury ETF, with holdings in Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) and Watches of Switzerland Group PLC. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs," Krystkowiak said.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF records $329 million net inflows despite market retreat

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded around $329 million in new investments on Monday, even as Bitcoin’s value fell below $67,000. With the fund’s strong performance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have successfully extended their winning streak to seven consecutive days with net buying exceeding $2.5 billion, according to Farside Investors data. Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also reported gains of approximately $6 million on Monday. In contrast, competing ETFs from Bitwise, ARK Invest/21Shares, VanEck, and Grayscale (GBTC) experienced redemptions, totaling over $40 million. The remaining ETFs saw no inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT remains a popular choice for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Over $1 billion worth of net capital went into the fund last week, accounting for half of US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT has now surpassed Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF in year-to-date inflows, ranking third overall less than ten months after its launch. As of October 18, IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings were valued at $26.5 billion, according to updated data from BlackRock. Despite recent price fluctuations, the sustained interest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests robust institutional engagement, although upcoming US elections and global tensions could impact market stability. Bitcoin peaked at $69,500 on Monday before retreating below $67,000. It is currently trading at around $67,400, down around 2% in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko.

Deandre Brown Companies like Amazon, Apple, and BlackRock are putting their foot down with remote employees in a mass mandate for them to return to the office. This will likely mean that workers of all ages will be in the same physical space together for the first time, which can spell out some challenges for leaders aiming to create healthy workplace cultures for all. This is particularly concerning for a large number of Gen Z workers who’ve had the bulk of their college and early job experiences shaped virtually due to the pandemic. Understandably, this has affected their professional progress. Per data reported by Inc., 60% of employers have admitted to firing Gen Z employees they’ve hired this year, which opens a larger conversation about widening generational gaps between the young adults and their youngish counterparts, millennials, who are likely to be their immediate supervisors. Some employers have claimed that Gen Z workers are unprofessional and lack communication skills. Despite these strong claims, Deandre Brown—a content creator and consultant that advises corporate clients on how to engage with Gen Z audiences—says the rift isn’t one-sided. “I think the onus is on both the employer and the young workers to come to a reasonable solution,” he says. Deandre Brown “I have mixed emotions about this topic,” Brown continues. Before becoming a full-time entrepreneur, he worked with Citi as a banking analyst. After noticing some challenges that his peers faced while climbing the corporate ladder, he began sharing professional tips in humorous videos on TikTok and Instagram. A short while later he amassed thousands of followers, speaking to the need for relatable work advice that targets early careerists. “I like to think of Generation Z being placed in two categories—those who really don't care about work, are lazy and don't put in an effort, which is something you see throughout any generation, by the way. But then you also see a large percentage who do care about work and progression within their company. The breakdown within this latter group is they are putting themselves first because their values differ from older work-first generations, mainly millennials.’” To his point, ironically, much like their younger counterparts, in the early aughts millennials were once pegged as lazy and uncooperative a decade ago by older generations. But data suggests they are actually one of the hardest working generations. A recent report from Team Stage says that more than a quarter of them work two or more jobs and 73% are working more than 40 hours per week. “I think that companies need to be more honest about not wanting to work with Gen Z because they demand more of them, including more diversity, fair pay and better work/life balance opportunities,” Brown says. “Instead of being willing to work with us and understand the next generation, some companies are completely writing us off and saying, ‘Well, you all aren't ready to work, so we're just not going to deal with this.’” Andrew McCaskill, a career expert with LinkedIn suggests that managers have to realize the harsh realities their young new hires have been facing and build an infrastructure to support them. Andrew McCaskill "Gen Z has spent a significant portion of their job preparation years in a COVID-Bizzarro World reality,” McCaskill says. “So, we need to give them grace, clear direction, expectations and real on-boarding support. As long as the skills are there, it’s worth the investment to help them adjust to culture.” Kristina Wilson, founder of talent acquisition consultancy KW Careers says bridging the generational gaps usually begins with companies taking the time to ask the right questions. Kristina Wilson “Workplace leaders really have to be interested and invested in understanding what motivates certain generations: where work/life balance begins, and what productivity looks like for them,” she explains. “Oftentimes Gen Z is labeled as being very entitled to a Baby Boomer or a Gen Xer. But I don't label it as such. I think that they come into the workplace with way more awareness and firmer boundaries that aim to protect their mental health capacity, diversity, et cetera. While this is admirable, I do understand how this can translate as challenging for employers if the work isn’t getting done. There needs to be a happy medium, but it takes extreme awareness on both sides.” McCaskill agrees. “New professionals have to participate in their own rescue on this one, as well,” he says. “This is one of the most competitive job markets in a decade, and they have to take professional advice from people who have succeeded at work—as opposed to people who have succeeded at talking about work on social media. Gen Z is being targeted on social media platforms with a lot of really bad career advice. The long-standing rules of workplace norms still hold true in almost every environment. New professionals should build a network of advisors who are personally rooting for them to win—mentors, former bosses or professors, people in their chosen profession. Most of the people telling you not to wear a suit for an interview or to close your laptop at 5PM on the dot—don’t make money from working a job like the one you have. They make money from saying provocative things for clicks and likes.” With that, the three experts offered some advice for millennial leaders who are managing young workers. Help them gain self-awareness “Have a conversation with Gen Z workers about the critical need to be aware of their body language, communication skills, tactics and approaches—have some diversity within that,” Wilson says. Support them in acclimating to workplace norms “Incorporating an onboarding buddy to help them understand the office norms can be incredibly helpful,” McCaskill suggests. “Managers also owe it Gen Z workers to be clear about what’s expected. Unspoken expectations are often unmet expectations. Now is the time to actually state the obvious.” Create space for them to feel heard Research suggests that Gen Z workers have very strong values that spill into the workplace, and they want to feel heard. “We need to actually listen and hear them because if they don’t feel this, they’ll disengage or walk away from the job altogether,” Brown says. “Reserving opportunities for the team members to discuss their concerns, workplace desires and grievances without shaming them is critically important. Setting up regular 1:1 check-ins is a way to do that. It goes a long way, and honestly, it will signal to them that you truly care about co-existing.” One Community. Many Voices.

(Bloomberg) -- French investment firm Wendel has agreed to acquire a majority stake in private lender Monroe Capital for $1.13 billion to extend its reach to the booming private credit category. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Wendel will buy a 75% stake in Monroe Capital and provide an additional $1 billion to grow Chicago-based firm’s business and seed new funds, according to a statement on Tuesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The transaction also includes an earn-out mechanism of as much as $255 million. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. Founded in 2004 by Theodore Koenig, Monroe provides private credit to borrowers in the US and Canada and manages about $19.5 billion. The company has 11 offices including one in Abu Dhabi and one in Seoul. “This is a very significant and transforming deal for Wendel,” Laurent Mignon, chief executive officer of Wendel, said in a press conference. “It will increase our exposure to the US, which is a good thing because the US economy is more dynamic than Europe’s over the long term.” The deal for Monroe dovetails with Wendel’s new strategic direction announced last year. The firm has been building out a new asset management business overseeing third-party money. Family-backed Wendel has previously invested from its own balance sheet. It sold holdings in publicly-listed firms and redeployed the proceeds into private markets. It bought a majority stake in mid-market buyout firm IK Partners earlier this year. Monroe will be a great base for Wendel to launch its private credit operation in Europe, which is much less developed than in the US, Mignon said. In the short term, Wendel will focus on Monroe’s integration, but it will keep looking for opportunities in the infrastructure area and in secondary market for private equity in Europe and the US, he said. Shares of Wendel rose as much as 1.7% in early Tuesday trading in Paris, giving the company a market value of about €4.2 billion ($4.5 billion). Lucrative Business Wendel will acquire 50% in Monroe from its management and another 25% from Bonaccord Capital Partners. AXA IM Prime, a unit of AXA Investment Managers, could invest alongside Wendel as a minority shareholder. The Paris-based firm will have a path to purchase the remaining shares in subsequent transactions that would take place in three instalments over 2028 and 2032. UBS Group AG and financial-services specialist Fenchurch Advisory advised Wendel, while Monroe was advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The lucrative and growing world of private credit has attracted firms including Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc., Ares Management Corp. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. It’s also spurred acquisitions and partnerships by firms seeking to expand their reach. Last year, TPG Inc. bought credit firm Angelo Gordon for $2.7 billion. BlackRock Inc. agreed this year to buy Adebayo Ogunlesi’s Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion in a transformational deal for the industry. Blue Owl has struck multiple deals this year, including agreeing to buy credit manager Atalaya Capital Management. BlackRock is among the firms exploring a purchase of HPS Investment Partners, Bloomberg News reported this month. Apollo has teamed up with Citigroup Inc. on $25 billion worth of private credit deals over the next five years. Lazard Inc. has also considered several opportunities to acquire a private-credit firm. --With assistance from Francois de Beaupuy, Paula Seligson, Silas Brown and Gillian Tan.

Title: What to see and do in Dublin, Ireland

National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here From Temple Bar to the Book of Kells, the Irish capital has its fair share of iconic attractions, but you’ll find just as much magic elsewhere — in its thriving music scene, new breed of after-hour spaces and the coastline right on its doorstep. Dublin is a city that’s impossible to ‘do’. It has its big hits: there’s the Guinness Storehouse, where the ‘black stuff’ is brewed, tasted and revered; and there are taprooms that thump in the party district of Temple Bar. Dublin Castle sits near Trinity College, the country’s oldest and most illustrious university, which guards the Book of Kells, a treasured ninth-century manuscript. Literary giants like James Joyce made Dublin a UNESCO City of Literature and now stand alongside musicians like U2 and Sinéad O’Connor in its hall of fame — their legacy popping up across the city in street plaques, museums, former homes and studios. But Ireland’s capital and biggest city doesn’t have a huge number of defining landmarks to tick off. Which suggests something the locals will readily tell you: this is a place about the in-between moments. Take a beat, and you’ll see Dubliners weaving past their icons and legends like the city’s River Liffey around stone. You’re more likely to mingle with them in, say, the Creative Quarter, a web of independent boutiques, cafes and restaurants between South William Street and George’s Street, or inner-city districts like Stoneybatter, The Liberties and Portobello. They’ll be happy to give their take, and have their craic — the all-Irish good time, tinged with humour and wit — particularly in old-school pubs, where much of social life unfolds. No matter where you end up going in the city, you’ll notice new shots of energy alongside the old staples. Celebrated French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten has recently opened a rooftop restaurant at The Leinster hotel, for instance — the latest in a small but fast-growing city trend. Brilliant old boozers remain, but there are also new, nichey waves of basement wine bars and ‘audiophile’ spaces pairing craft beers and cocktails with vinyl DJs and bespoke sound systems. Trinity College now runs a concert series on its cricket pitch and the Guinness Storehouse has been experimenting with after-hours events featuring the likes of DJ Annie Mac and Northern Irish electronic duo Bicep. Dublin is bisected by the Liffey, which fuels a fairly deep-rooted Northside-Southside rivalry. Its centre is tight-knit, with urban villages inside circling canals, and you’ll find flickers of Viking and medieval heritage (like sections of the old city wall, church crypts or throwback names like Winetavern and Fishamble) between Georgian squares and street murals. All of this makes it a place best explored on foot, taking the odd tram, taxi or bus. It can take a minute to get your bearings — but, all things considered, in a place where so much can be found where you don’t expect it, that’s hardly a downside. Dublin is a city that’s impossible to ‘do’ — so just dive in. 1. Book of KellsThis millennia-old Gospel book, crafted by Celtic monks and world-famous for its intricate illustrations, is displayed in Trinity College’s Old Library. A new, immersive experience complements the visit: admire the manuscript behind a glass case — the pages are flipped every day — then continue through a pavilion that brings it to life with holograms, 360-degree audio-visual displays and more hi-tech wizardry. 2. Behind the scenesNear O’Connell Bridge, Abbey Theatre has been at the centre of Irish cultural life for 120 years. Tours take visitors into the wings and back of house to prop vaults and dressing rooms. In the southside suburb of Ringsend, there’s a similar backstage feel on the Windmill Lane Recording Studios tour — U2, Van Morrison and Sinéad O’Connor are just some of the icons who’ve left their mark here. 3. Croke ParkMany cities have stadium tours, but few are like this one. In Dumcondra, a 15-minute walk from the city centre, Croke Park is Grand Central for hurling and Gaelic football (also known as GAA), the country’s biggest spectator sport. You can book an all-areas tour, strap in for skyline views from its roof or visit a museum explaining the GAA’s place in Irish community life. Better still, buy a ticket for a game. 4. Museum magicIreland’s national museums and galleries are free to visit. See Viking gold and grisly bog bodies at the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology on Kildare Street, then pop around the block to the National Gallery of Ireland. 5. 14 Henrietta StreetExperience more than 300 years of Dublin life at this social history museum set in a restored townhouse. Its rooms are staged as they would have looked in different eras, connecting the stories of those who’ve called this address home, from images of Georgian grandeur to tales of tenement squalor. The visit ends at a restored 20th-century flat, complete with stocked shelves and the smell of carbolic soap. Guided tours only. 6. Tune inDublin’s music scene is on a high, with young local musicians like Lankum, CMAT and Pillow Queens making global headlines. Catch the next big thing while they’re still small at venues like Whelan’s on Wexford Street or the Button Factory in Temple Bar. Or sample trad music at The Cobblestone in Smithfield, a short Luas (tram) ride west of O’Connell Street. 1. Powerscourt Townhouse CentreThe courtyard of this Georgian townhouse was once a car park. Today, it houses a boutique shopping centre with a mix of independent cafes and shops. Try the bacon and pear sandwich at The Pepper Pot, then browse interiors at Article, set in the townhouse’s former dressing room. 2. Sweny’sStep inside this former pharmacy near Trinity College and you’ll enter Edwardian Dublin. The space is now a volunteer-run bookstore, but it’s still crammed with mahogany counters, glass cabinets and medicinal vials. It was featured in Ulysses; a lemon soap bar, as chosen by Leopold Bloom in the novel, is a great souvenir for devotees of James Joyce. 3. Om DivaDrury Street is a small but satisfying shopping strip with craft, design and second-hand stores, as well as speciality cafes and restaurants. It’s here you’ll find this trove of vintage and affordable clothing, the brainchild of Ruth Ní Loinsigh, a household name of the Dublin fashion scene. The first floor is a hub for emerging talent. 1. Coke Lane PizzaThe Coke Lane Pizza team serve up Neapolitan-style slices at Lucky’s and The Circular, two neighbourhood bars located respectively in The Liberties and Rialto. Try a Magnum PI, topped with wood-fired ham hock and Teeling Whiskey-flambéd pineapple — it’s ‘100% guilt-free’. 2. The Winding StairBrowse this bistro’s ground-floor bookshop, then follow the staircase up to a little dining room overlooking the River Liffey and Ha’penny Bridge. It’s a Dublin classic thanks to its homely air, wooden tables and local food — such as a charcuterie board with salami from The Wooded Pig, a family-run farm an hour’s drive north of the city. 3. LiathLiath means ‘grey’ in Irish, but this 14-seater restaurant in Blackrock — some 15 minutes south of the centre by bus or train — is anything but. Its seasonal tasting menus have seen it net two Michelin stars; an autumn line-up might include pigeon with raspberry preserve and trompette mushroom. 1. Wren Urban NestHere’s a carbon-neutral, uber-central option. The compact, entry-level ‘snug’ rooms pair Scandi-inflected minimalism with smart storage nooks. In the basement, bar and restaurant Alt does weekend brunch with a buffet selection of charcuterie and homemade cakes, plus bottomless mimosas. 2. Number 31This 21-room hotel is a warm, witty counterpoint to cut-and-paste city chains. It combines a Georgian townhouse with a modernist garden mews, and each room is individually decorated with fin-de-siecle and art deco flourishes. Breakfast is at communal tables; don’t miss chef Delia Bracken’s cranberry bread, baked fresh on site and much-loved by repeat guests. 3. The ShelbourneSet across several Georgian townhouses, Dublin’s grand dame is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. It’s hosted a ‘who’s who’ ranging from Grace Kelly to the Rolling Stones, but what really sets this hotel apart is the presence of locals at its bars and lounges. A room overlooking St Stephen’s Green is worth the stretch. 1. BreadMan WalkingGerry Godley opens the door to his central home-turned-microbakery every Saturday between 12pm and 3pm, allowing customers to pick pastries, bread and cakes straight from the oven. Pre-order by direct message on Instagram and you’ll be sent the address in return. You can’t go wrong with a brioche tasting box. 2. Bar hopSkim several Dublin drinking scenes by booking a trail of central basement bars. Kick off with a pint at The Merrion Hotel’s 18th-century brick vaults, then saunter over to wine bar Cellar 22 for a glass of sustainable Riesling and wind up with a seaweed-infused old fashioned at Blind Pig, a speakeasy-style cocktail bar. 3. Dublin Coastal TrailRunning from Skerries, in the north of the county, to Killiney, in the south, this new, 40-mile coastal trail links 11 seafront villages and takes in medieval castles, cliff walks, watersport locations and craft shops. It’s accessible from the city centre by the DART rail system and Irish Rail. On a sunny day, opt for the Bleeper Bike share scheme, available at several stops along the way. 1. Grogan’s Castle LoungeIn a city famous for its traditional pubs, this option near the Irish Whiskey Museum is worth your time. It has strip-wood-panelling, tasselled lamps and a rotating gallery of amateur art on the walls. Come for a creamy Guinness and a simple but tasty ‘special’ — a ham, cheese and tomato toastie served with Colman’s mustard. 2. FidelityDublin has a new wave of audiophile bars pairing bespoke sound systems with craft drinks, slick design and an indie ethos. Fidelity in Smithfield is the standout, featuring a curving marble counter, retro hi-fi speakers and a DJ booth with vinyl decks. For alternatives, look to The Big Romance on Parnell Street and Bootleg on Drury Street. 3. Lumo ClubRun by Dublin DJ and promoter Niall Byrne, of music blog Nialler9, this is a super-inclusive club night that’s ‘about classics and curveballs’ — everything from pop and electronic to Phil Collins and Italian disco duo La Bionda. It takes place monthly at small, central venues like The Workmans Club in Temple Bar or Yamamori Tengu, on the opposite bank of the Liffey.

Title: Children with scoliosis offered surgery in United Kingdom and New York
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/2024/10/22/children-with-scoliosis-offered-surgery-in-united-kingdom-and-new-york/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T23:01:00Z
Full Content:
The Department of Health has offered families of children with severe paediatric spinal conditions such as scoliosis the option of treatment in big hospitals in the UK and in New York as part of a drive to dramatically lower the number of patients waiting for longer than four months for procedures. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will tell the Cabinet on Tuesday that the number of patients on the active waiting list for longer than four months by the end of 2024 will fall to 20, down from 86 at the start of the year. Mr Donnelly will bring detailed projections to Cabinet on the actions being taken regarding numbers awaiting urgent treatment. On Tuesday, the Government is also expected to agree to begin the process of drafting an Occupied Territories Bill that would ban goods or services in Ireland that are connected to unlawful Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories. Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin will seek Cabinet approval for a review that could create a “legal pathway forward”. However, Mr Martin said on Monday it was unlikely that the Bill would be drafted before the general election. On scoliosis surgery, Mr Donnelly is expected to say that reductions in surgical waiting times are being achieved despite an increase in additions to the surgical list due to significantly higher numbers of outpatient clinics being held. He will also note new initiatives to ensure that the backlog is reduced and children receive faster access to care. Patients are now being offered treatments abroad in Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York, Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and Portland Hospital UK. A total of 20 patients are confirmed for treatment abroad, as of September 2024, some of whom have already had surgery. Any child who travels abroad will be given a comprehensive support package which includes flights (with the child and one adult funded to travel in business class and another adult also covered to travel), accommodation, travel insurance and funding to cover expenses. Children’s Health Ireland (CHI) and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is projected to carry out 557 procedures in 2024, an increase of 93 compared to 2023. Initiatives are also under way at the Mater hospital and Blackrock Clinic. The Minister is expected to tell his Cabinet colleagues that some children are still waiting too long for care, but that any child on the active wait-list for longer than four months after Christmas (who is clinically suitable) will, in consultation with their treating clinician, be offered surgery overseas. He said CHI had confirmed to him that the additional surgeons and staff being hired would ensure enough surgical capacity to meet the needs of the service in future, once the current backlog is addressed. The waiting times of children with severe spinal conditions waiting for life-changing operations have long been a matter of political controversy. In 2017, Simon Harris, who was then minister for health, gave a commitment that no child would wait more than four months for spinal surgery. The target was not achieved. In 2022 Mr Donnelly allocated €19 million in funding to ensure that no child would wait longer than four months. It later emerged that CHI did not earmark all the funds to reduce waiting lists with some of the money being spent elsewhere.

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) stands against the other communication stocks. The communication sector seems to be performing well through this year as the sector ETFs are slightly outperforming the broader market. While XLC and VOX are up over 25% year-to-date as of October 17, the S&P has gained slightly over 23%. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management also sees significant opportunities in the tech and communications sector despite him being a value investor.

Economic indicators are looking solid, and the upcoming election could have a positive effect regardless of the outcome. Moving forward, the strongest earnings are likely to come from technology and communication stocks, despite them typically being outside value-focused investments. According to PwC’s Media and Telecommunications: US Deals 2024 Midyear Outlook, media and telecommunications deal activity remained subdued due to high interest rates and uncertain regulations, with deal volumes declining despite a slight rebound in values in 1H 2024. Consumer preferences are shifting towards short-form, user-generated content platforms like TikTok, where influencers play a significant role in attracting brand partnerships. Streaming platforms are evolving through bundling and partnerships to manage rising content costs while improving subscriber retention. AI, especially generative AI, is increasingly influencing content creation and ad tech, which are making campaigns more efficient and optimizing ad spending. Private equity investors are showing renewed interest, especially in consumer-focused deals, although regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns continue to complicate the market. As companies navigate these challenges, maintaining a strong consumer value proposition is crucial to retaining subscribers and driving growth. Our Methodology For this article, we identified over 40 communications services stocks with a market cap above $10 billion through the Finviz stock screener. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average price target upside as of October 17. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

A young, stylish woman using her smartphone to find inspiration for her latest DIY project. Average Price Target Upside: 33.58% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 The fourth best communication stock to buy on our list is Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS). It is a visual search platform where users discover, save, and act on ideas across several interests. The company has around 500 million active users globally and the platform is popular among women and Gen Z. It monetizes through ads, offering various formats like standard images, video, shopping, carousel, and interactive ads. Ads are served through an auction system, which are optimized for either brand awareness or conversions. AI and machine learning improve ad delivery, which in turn, improve performance for advertisers. The platform also provides tools for campaign management and measurement and helps brands assess their ad effectiveness. The company’s advertising appeals to brands across multiple industries, offering custom solutions based on their goals. Tipranks reported that on October 2, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski reaffirmed his Buy rating on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) due to several positive factors. He expects the company to achieve around 20% revenue growth, with the stock trading at a favorable valuation below 12 times the projected 2026 EBITDA. Gawrelski believes the company will surpass the upper end of its Q3 revenue guidance and beat consensus-adjusted EBITDA estimates, which show margin expansion. The analyst also views the company’s improvements in ad load and the release of the AI-driven Performance+ product. The analyst expects steady Q4 growth and controlled expenses, with optimism that a housing market recovery will boost engagement. Moreover, The Fly reported that KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson raised Pinterest’s (NYSE:PINS) price target from $43 to $45, maintaining an Overweight rating. The firm expects stronger-than-expected Q3 revenue and profitability due to a solid ad market and favorable currency movements. Despite macro uncertainty and a shorter holiday season, KeyBanc expects Pinterest's product cycles will support continued growth into 2025. ClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Selection in the communication services sector also weighed on performance, primarily driven by a decline in Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), which operates a social media platform where users can express their interests and discover ideas through images they “pin” to their pages. Having been a strong contributor in the first half of the year, the company gave back some of its gains as investors captured gains and an uptick in economic uncertainty pushed out spending by leading advertisers. We capitalized on this weakness to add to the position, as we believe that several of its internal initiatives to increase the monetization of its users and become a better value-added advertiser to its customers are coming to fruition.” Overall PINS ranks 4th on our list of the best communication stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of PINS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PINS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CareMax draws $5 million under loan amid financial strain
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/caremax-draws-5-million-under-loan-amid-financial-strain-93CH-3674057
Time Published: 2024-10-21T21:32:49Z
Full Content:
CareMax, Inc. (NASDAQ:CMAX), a provider of nursing and personal care services, has tapped into a $5 million loan to cover short-term operating expenses, as disclosed in a recent SEC filing. The transaction, carried out today, involved drawing funds under an existing credit agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC and other lenders. The Miami-based company, which operates under the healthcare sector with a focus on nursing and personal care facilities, is actively seeking ways to alleviate its capital strain. Efforts include cutting operating costs and exploring strategic alternatives such as refinancing and asset sales. Despite these actions, there's an acknowledgment of the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring if the company fails to stabilize its finances. CareMax's current financial situation, characterized by net losses, high indebtedness, and substantial cash used in operating activities, raises concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company's ability to comply with its debt covenants and to successfully execute its strategic plans, including asset divestitures, remains critical. CareMax's stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, along with its warrants. The company's financial maneuvers and strategic plans, as stated in the filing, are essential for investors to monitor as they assess the company's future prospects. This report is based on statements from a press release. In other recent news, CareMax, Inc. has made significant strides in managing its financial obligations. The company has reached an agreement with its lenders, including Jefferies Finance LLC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Financial Management, to extend the waiver on certain defaults under its credit agreement until various dates in 2024. This extension provides CareMax with additional time to address these defaults. In a strategic move to strengthen its balance sheet, CareMax has secured a $20 million credit facility, which includes a $4 million term loan and an additional $16 million available through delayed draw term loans. Despite challenges impacting its adjusted EBITDA, CareMax met its full-year revenue targets and membership goals. Analysts from Jefferies and UBS have adjusted their price targets for CareMax. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating but lowered the price target to $3.00, while UBS maintained a Neutral rating and revised its price target to $6.40. Recent InvestingPro data paints a challenging picture for CareMax, Inc. (NASDAQ:CMAX), aligning with the financial struggles outlined in the article. The company's market capitalization has dwindled to just $7.24 million, reflecting investor concerns about its financial health. InvestingPro Tips highlight that CareMax is "quickly burning through cash" and "operates with a significant debt burden," which directly relates to the company's need to tap into a $5 million loan for short-term operating expenses. The tip that "short term obligations exceed liquid assets" further underscores the liquidity issues mentioned in the article. The company's financial performance is concerning, with a negative gross profit margin of -3.31% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and an operating income margin of -17.33% for the same period. These figures support the article's mention of net losses and high indebtedness. Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows a significant return of 20.25% over the last three months, suggesting some investor optimism or speculative interest. However, this should be viewed in the context of a 97.22% price decline over the past year. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 8 additional tips for CareMax, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial situation and market position.

Posted on 10/21/2024 2:02:03 PM PDT by george76 A grandfather imprisoned for two years and eight months for taking part in an anti-immigration protest in Rotherham, England, has been found dead in His Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Moorland. Peter Lynch, 61, carried a placard asserting politicians, police, journalists, and others had been corrupted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), BlackRock, Vanguard, and others at a protest outside a hotel hosting illegal immigrants following the deadly stabbing of three young girls in the town of Southport, allegedly by a migration-background teenager. The courts admitted Lych’s placard and protest were not unlawful. Still, they chastised him for having “a general conspiracy theory against anyone and any form of authority” and alleged his “racist and provocative” verbal abuse of riot police crossed the line into illegality. ... Body camera footage from the day of the protest shows Lynch, a heart attack survivor, telling riot police they “are protecting people who are killing our kids and raping them.” Rotherham is an infamous hotspot for Muslim grooming gang abuse, with working-class white girls being groomed, raped, and pimped by predominantly Muslim men of Pakistani heritage for years while local authorities refused to act for fear they would be accused of racism. The circumstances of Lynch’s death are under investigation, but sources say he appears to have taken his own life. As anti-immigration protesters were being sentenced, Comcast-owned Sky News previously reported sources saying, “Any right-wing, far-right protester landing up in jail, well, they can expect a pretty cold reception from… [South] Asian gangs inside prison who will be looking out for them.” Muslims officially account for 6.7 percent of Britain’s population, but they account for around 18 percent of prisoners, and they are now the dominant force among the prison population.
