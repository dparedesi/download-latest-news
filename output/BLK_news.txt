Title: Circle plans native token for Arc blockchain as Q3 profit surges

The stablecoin issuer considered stablecoin-denominated gas fees on Arc, but has a long-term goal of shifting to distributed governance. Stablecoin issuer Circle, the company behind the USDC dollar-pegged stablecoin, is planning a native token for its ARC layer-1 blockchain testnet, an enterprise-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine network. Circle launched the Arc testnet in October, with participation from investment bank Goldman Sachs, asset manager BlackRock, credit card company Visa and over 100 other companies. The company, which disclosed plans for the new token alongside its earnings on Wednesday, initially planned to center gas fees on the Arc network around USDC (USDC) and other stablecoins. According to a statement, Circle’s long-term goal is to pivot Arc to a decentralized governance model of geographically distributed validators: Cointelegraph reached out to Circle but had not received a response at time of publication. Related: Circle’s Arc attracts South Korea’s first won-backed stablecoin experiment The company also disclosed its financial results for the third quarter of 2025, reporting revenue of $740 million, a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle reported net income of $214 million in Q3, representing a 202% gain over the period. However, costs also rose, with distribution and transaction costs rising by 74% compared with 2024, totaling $448 million in the last quarter. Additionally, operating costs rose by 70% in Q3, reaching $211 million, which the company attributed to a 14% increase in its workforce and higher compensation costs for employees. Circle’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a critical metric for publicly-traded stocks, increased by 78% year-over-year, totaling $166 million for the quarter. The launch of the Arc network highlights the growing institutional involvement in crypto and the shift toward application-specific blockchain networks tailored for specific use cases, platforms, and digital assets. Developers turning to application-specific blockchain networks aim to circumvent the relatively low speed, scalability issues, and high fees associated with general-purpose blockchain networks that handle mixed traffic. Hyperliquid and Injective protocols are examples of applications built on app-specific layer-1 blockchain networks. However, critics argue that app-specific blockchains fragment liquidity, are prone to hacking due to centralization, and lack the community support that is a feature of general-purpose blockchain networks with distributed governance.“Appchains also grossly underestimate the cost of infrastructure and compliance: explorers, custody, exchanges, oracles, bridges, toolkits, integrated development environments, on/off ramps, native issuance and integration, and regulatory compliance,” Andre Cronje, co-founder of Sonic Labs, said. Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, the lead development team for the Polygon layer-2 blockchain network, disagreed with Cronje, arguing that more robust interoperability between blockchain networks is already happening and will solve these issues.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in the stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and gaming industries.

Title: Bitcoin – Why the $524M BTC rush is latest threat to ETH’s rally

Is this the comeback signal institutions were waiting for? Alt HD: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $524 million surge – Are institutions quietly accumulating BTC again? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) topped the list with $224.2 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s and Ark Invest’s ETFs. Despite strong ETF inflows, Bitcoin slightly dipped 0.31%, trading around $104,772.57 at press time. After a turbulent start to November marked by steady outflows, Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs made a strong comeback on 11th November, recording a massive $524 million in inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. There was a big increase in investments in Bitcoin recently, the largest in weeks. This suggests that investors might be feeling more positive about Bitcoin’s future after some uncertainty in the market. Among the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the surge with a remarkable $224.2 million in inflows. It was followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $165.9 million, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which saw inflows of $102.5 million. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $24.1 million, and Bitwise’s BITB brought in $7.3 million. The remaining Bitcoin ETFs, however, registered zero flows during the same period. Source: Carl Moon/X The timing of these inflows was particularly notable, as BTC was trading around $105,000 on the day of the surge. At the time of writing, BTC had slightly retreated to $104,772.57, marking a 0.31% decline in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the minor dip, the strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect renewed investor confidence and continued institutional interest amid broader market volatility. In contrast, Spot Ethereum [ETH] ETFs faced a challenging day, recording total outflows worth $107.1 million. Grayscale’s ETHE led the downturn with $75.7 million in outflows, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA, which saw $19.8 million leave the fund. Other Ethereum-based ETFs also recorded modest outflows, while a few registered neutral activity with zero net flows. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,510.63, down 1.45% in the past 24 hours, signaling a brief cooling-off period after recent gains. On the other hand, Solana [SOL]-based Spot ETFs saw modest but positive traction. The two approved Solana ETFs, Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL, collectively recorded $8 million in inflows. Of this, GSOL contributed $5.9 million, while BSOL added $2.1 million. Meanwhile, SOL was trading at $159.25, reflecting a 2.41% decline over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. These movements came amid a broader landscape where multiple altcoin ETFs remain pending approval, and major institutional players like BlackRock continue to exercise caution. Therefore, BlackRock’s cautious approach toward altcoin ETFs stems from its firm belief in Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only assets with lasting value.

Title: Easttree Media, BlackRock-Backed Investment Platform for TV, Film Income Rights, Launches at AFM (EXCLUSIVE)
URL: https://variety.com/2025/film/global/easttree-media-investment-platform-tv-film-income-rights-1236575728/

By Alex Ritman A new investment company plans to take a leaf from the recent spate of musicians selling the rights to their own back catalogs and shift it into the film and TV space. Easttree Media, an investment platform acquiring income rights in some of what it claims are the “world’s most iconic films and television shows,” has announced its official launch at the American Film Market. Among it founders are two former execs from Hipgnosis, the ambitious management company that made headlines for splashing hundreds of millions of dollars on buying the rights to song catalogs from some of the world’s best known musicians. Related Stories 'Now You See Me: Now You Don't' Review: Jesse Eisenberg Leads an Expanded Team of Magicians in a Worthy Third Sleight-of-Hand Thriller Thai Horror Hit 'Death Whisperer 3' to Mark FearFolks' India Launch (EXCLUSIVE) Founded in the U.K., Easttree was backed by funds and accounts backed by U.S. investment management giant BlackRock in May of this year. Popular on Variety The company provides actors, writers, directors, producers and other rights holders — including production companies, studios and financiers — with what it says is the “ability to monetize all or part of their participation interests.” Focusing exclusively on passive profit participations in film and TV properties, it “enables sellers to monetise 100% of their income rights or pursue partial buyouts that create ongoing alignment and long-term revenue partnerships.” Easttree — which has already completed multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists — was founded in 2024 by Marc Allen, Chris Helm, and Markku Lonnqvist. Allen brings expertise from the film and TV entertainment space, having previously served as COO of the management and production company 42. Helm previously served as CFO Hipgnosis Songs Funds overseeing acquisitions of music catalogues. Lonnqvist most recently served as the Chief Investment Officer at Hipgnosis Song Management and was previously a partner at Pamplona Capital Management. “I’m proud to have created this business with our team and BlackRock,” said Allen. “Being able to provide such a service for such a broad range of talent, as well as sophisticated, high value solutions for the world’s largest film and TV entertainment industry players gives us a unique opportunity to work with creators, producers and platforms across the whole film and TV spectrum regardless of scale.” Added Helm: “Our vision is to approach film and TV participations through a fresh lens — bringing transparency, alignment and partnerships that serve talent. We’re firm believers that acquirors of music rights can scale, succeed commercially and still advocate for artists. We are bringing that same conviction to film and television, turning these income rights into a transformative new asset class.” Paul Braude, head of the direct private opportunities group at BlackRock, said: “We are pleased to collaborate with Easttree Media on their journey. Iconic film and television titles continue to attract audiences well beyond their initial release, and we believe these assets provide our clients with even greater choice to meet their investment needs alongside access to distinctive and durable source of returns.” Hipgnosis — which launched in 2018 — went on a spree of acquisitions between 2021 and 2023, acquiring the catalogs of artists including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and many more. It helped drive the price of music catalogs to new heights, but grew overextended and eventually sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6 billion.

Title: Trump snubs BofA CEO Brian Moynihan in White House dinner for Wall Street execs: sources

President Trump appears to have snubbed Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan as he hosts a White House dinner with top Wall Street executives on Wednesday — signaling a persistent rift between the pair over the “debanking” of the president following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, The Post has learned. Moynihan, CEO of the nation’s second-biggest bank, failed to score an invite to the Wednesday dinner — even as JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon received an invite and is expected to attend, according to sources. Other CEOs slated to attend include Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser was invited but won’t be able to attend, according to a source close to the situation. Fraser is believed to be in Trump’s good graces following a report last month that she secured a deal to begin managing Trump’s money. Dimon’s invite comes despite the fact that JPMorgan disclosed last week that it’s being probed over allegations it denied banking services to conservatives. Dimon, however, is known as a political moderate who has maintained a close relationship with Trump, who has often floated his name as a possible Treasury secretary. As for the BofA boss, “Trump has no great love for Moynihan,” according to a CEO who is slated to attend the Wednesday dinner. A White House spokesman declined to comment, as did a Bank of America spokesman. “We don’t take this as a snub,” a source close to Moynihan told The Post. “Brian gets invited to enough dinners.” The person pointed to a state dinner for Trump at Windsor Castle where Moynihan was in attendance and other top CEOs weren’t. But that dinner was hosted by King Charles III, not the White House. On Wednesday, Moynihan told Fox News he wants to meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to discuss the city’s future as competing states try to court concerned business owners away from the Big Apple. Trump has lashed out publicly against the BofA boss — on at least two occasions. The first was in January during a virtual Q&A session with the BofA CEO sitting on stage in Davos, Switzerland. In a TV interview this summer, Trump claimed BofA was among the banks that denied the Trump Organization services following his first term. Big banks like BofA and JPMorgan Chase blamed pressure from the nascent Biden administration to deny services to various right-leaning businesses and individuals including Trump. The specific reason for Trump and his family business concerned his involvement in the January 6 Capital Hill melee and the controversy surrounding it. Moynihan is considered one of Wall Street’s most progressive CEOs on various cultural issues, including employment practices like diversity, equity and inclusion as well as environmental social governance investing.

Never miss a story. Another issue for Moynihan has been his involvement in the culture wars that have swept academia pitting some of the most prestigious colleges against a White House determined to remove left-wing bias from campuses. He was chancellor of the corporation of Brown University when the notoriously left-leaning college voted on divesting its massive endowment from companies that do business with Israel, which leftists deemed an apartheid state committing genocide over its military response to the Oct. 7 murder of innocent Israelis by Hamas terrorists. The vote ultimately failed in its so-called corporation, the governing body of the university. Advertisement

Title: Donald Trump set to host Wall Street CEOs including Jamie Dimon for swanky White House dinner

President Trump is set to roll out the red carpet for Wall Street bigwigs, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, at a White House dinner on Wednesday evening, sources told The Post. Two insiders, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman, and Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick would also join the commander-in-chief tonight in Washington, D.C. News of the dinner, which is being seen as an attempt by Trump to drum up support for his economic agenda from America’s top business leaders, was first reported by CBS News. The president’s public schedule shows that a dinner will take place in the White House’s state dining room at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Post has approached the White House for comment. It comes after increased scrutiny of this administration’s handling of economic issues and consumer costs, after hard-left Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral race by focusing on the spiralling cost of living in the Big Apple. The real estate mogul won backing from corporate America during his 2024 campaign by pledging to slash taxes and red tape, although his move to slap hefty tariffs on imported goods has disrupted Uncle Sam’s trade flows and disrupted markets worldwide. JPMorgan’s Dimon also warned Trump of the dangers of undermining Fed Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who came under fire after The Post broke the news of his $2.5 billion renovation of the central bank’s downtown DC HQ, prompting uproar among Republicans in Congress. This newspaper also exclusively reported that the Trump campaign’s top staff had used the 69-year-old veteran chief executive as a “sounding board” for shaping their economic policies before the president’s crushing electoral win over Kamala Harris in November last year. Trump and Dimon met for the first time in years when they held talks at the Oval Office in July to discuss economic and regulatory policies. In September, the president hosted a similar dinner for technology leaders, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook, where the corporate titan committed to expanding domestic investments, especially in artificial intelligence, an area prioritized by the administration.

Firms will pay out money in fiat USD, and recipients will receive the money in dollar-pegged stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, the world’s second largest stablecoin by capitalization. It doesn’t appear that companies will be able to send stablecoins directly via the scheme. Visa did not mention if or when support for stablecoins other than USDC would be added, though it didn't say the service would be exclusive to USDC. Anyone who wants to use the service to receive payments will need both a stablecoin wallet and to pass customary AML/KYC checks, and the pilot is currently limited to platforms and businesses based in the U.S. Visa earmarked the service as being useful for the creator and gig economy. For example, firms like TikTok or YouTube, which deliver small, irregular payments to millions of people globally, though no participants were announced. Visa says it is in the process of onboarding partners, with wider access projected for some point in the second half of 2026, depending on local regulations. The pilot comes as part of Visa Direct, the payment giant’s service that allows users to conduct payments using its own payment rails rather than, for example, those of two banks. The payments giant also didn’t confirm what payment rails the service might use, but it’s been linking up with Circle on stablecoin infrastructure as of late. In late October, Circle announced that Visa was among the firms participating in its new public testnet for Arc, its Layer-1 blockchain network, alongside companies such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Visa has made a series of increasingly bullish moves in the stablecoin space during 2025. In May, it poured an unspecified amount into London-based stablecoin infrastructure company BVNK as a “strategic investment” via its Visa Ventures arm. Earlier this month, Visa issued a report predicting an increased role for stablecoins in the $40 trillion global credit market, saying that stablecoin-based lending could allow traditional institutions to bring parts of that market onto programmable, blockchain-based rails. Meanwhile, like rival Mastercard, Visa has been adding support for stablecoin-based crypto credit cards—including with fintech Rain in the U.S., and Bridge, a unit of payments giant Stripe, in Latin America.

Title: Ethereum Is ‘Infrastructure for Wall Street.’ Could $PEPENODE Be the Next Beneficiary?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-infrastructure-wall-street-pepenode-explode-next/

Quick Facts: Ethereum’s ($ETH) reputation as crypto’s settlement layer just got a major institutional stamp. Former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom argued that Ethereum isn’t merely another blockchain; it’s the ‘infrastructure’ Wall Street can actually build on in an interview with CoinDesk. His case rests on the three things TradFi will not compromise on: liquidity, security, and trust that lets compliance teams sleep at night. And Chalom is putting his thoughts into action over at SharpLink. The staking of billions of dollars’ worth of Ether validates $ETH’s role as the foundational layer for the future of finance. That framing hits differently in late 2025, especially if you believe what BlackRock CEO Larry Fink thinks of tokenization being the next generation for markets, something he has touted since 2022. For traders watching risk rotations, that institutional endorsement often kick-starts a familiar second-order trade: attention and flows migrate toward $ETH-aligned narratives and apps that feel built for scale, such as PEPENODE ($PEPENODE). PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is a project aiming to build an Ethereum-based ‘mine-to-earn’ ecosystem with a gamified staking model. In a market hunting for a solid premise tied to real utility, a memecoin that anchors incentives to Ethereum’s trust layer is sure to attract investors. Overall, its pitch is simple: take the dopamine of mining, strip out the hardware, and plug it into Ethereum’s security and tooling. You’ll start off with an empty virtual server room. From here, you’ll be able to buy your first node, which you can then combine with other nodes, which helps boost your mining output. Rather than combining nodes at random, you’ll need to have a bit of strategy. That’s because a certain combination of these nodes will have an impact on your performance. Get it right and you’ll get a higher yield. You’ll have a dashboard where you can track your progress, including your hashrate, energy, and rewards. All in all, you’ll get a taste of crypto mining without building and maintaining an expensive rig all by yourself. After the TGE, staking, node utility, and a leaderboard system will also go live. As a participant, you’ll be encouraged to continue optimizing your setup, as doing so helps you generate more coins, including exclusive $PEPENODE boosts and some of the best meme coins like Pepe and Fartcoin. While none of this guarantees price performance, the mix of gamified progression, measurable on-chain actions, and $ETH’s credibility gives PEPENODE a shot at stronger retention than the average meme coin. Due to these factors, we believe the token has the potential to reach a high of $0.0072 by the end of 2026, a 528.6% increase according to our PEPENODE price prediction. At the moment, the PEPENODE presale continues to gain traction, having raised over $2.12M to date. You can still buy its native $PEPENODE tokens for $0.0011454 each, which you can claim after the presale or stake to earn 609% APY. When staking, it’s worth noting that the rewards rate will change as more tokens are added to the staking pool. As with most token presales, PEPENODE features regular price increases. Because of this, the rule of thumb is to always act as quickly as possible so you can lock in tokens at the best possible price at the moment. There are two days left before the next price increase in this ongoing presale, so hurry. Join the PEPENODE presale today.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are higher this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Tuesday; the House of Representatives is poised to vote on legislation to end the six-week U.S. government shutdown; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are rising after the chipmaker projected strong revenue growth over the coming years; the White House is reportedly examining measures that could limit the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers in shareholder voting; and shares of On Holding are soaring after the sneaker maker posted strong earnings and raised its guidance. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are moving higher as investors keep close tabs on developments in Washington D.C., with a key vote scheduled later today that could end government shutdown. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.2% recently after the blue-chip index closed at a record high on Tuesday. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin was at just under $105,000, up from an overnight low of around $102,500. Gold futures rose 0.6% to $4,140 an ounce, trading near their highest levels in three weeks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array of consumer loans, was at 4.08%, down from the previous close of 4.11%. The House of Representatives is set to vote on a spending measure that would reopen the government through January and end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. A key House committee moved the Senate-passed legislation forward in an early-Wednesday vote, rejecting attempts by some Democrats to amend the legislation. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the legislation, bringing an end to the shutdown, which is now in its 43rd day. The work stoppage has contributed to a freeze on U.S. government economic reports, while also creating staffing issues in the air traffic control system that prompted officials to reduce the number of flights. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) jumped in premarket trading after CEO Lisa Su said the chipmaker’s revenue could grow by 35% annually over the next three-to-five years owing to continued strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. At the company’s first-ever analysts day on Tuesday, Su said that the company’s AI data center business could grow by 80% annually over the same period, potentially hitting tens of billions of dollars in sales by 2027. AMD also said its gross margins would come in at around 55% to 58% in coming years, ahead of analysts' forecasts. Shares of AMD, which have nearly doubled in value since the start of the year, were up 6% ahead of the bell. The White House is looking at new measures that would reduce the influence of proxy advisers and index-fund managers on shareholder voting, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The report said that Trump administration officials are considering executive orders that could ban proxy advisers such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis from making recommendations on shareholder votes. Officials are also looking to curtail the influence of index-fund managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, according to the report. The influence of proxy firms has been criticized by top corporate executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who faced resistance from proxy advisers ahead of a recent shareholder vote on his trillion-dollar pay package. Shares of On Holding (ONON) are soaring in premarket trading after the Roger Federer-backed Swiss sneaker maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook. On posted adjusted earnings of 0.43 Swiss francs ($0.54) per share on net sales that jumped 25% year-over-year to 794.4 million Swiss francs ($994.2 million), well above Wall Street estimates. The Zurich-based company, which lifted its guidance for a third straight quarter, now expects full-year sales to grow by 34% on a constant-currency basis, up from a previous projection of at least 31%. Profitability is also expected to rise. On co-founder and executive co-chairman Caspar Coppetti told CNBC the company won't be offering Black Friday deals and will be "full price through the holiday season." On shares, which through yesterday's close had shed more than a third of their value this year, were up 8% in recent trading.

"Circle continued to see accelerating adoption of USDC and our platform in the third quarter as we build the new Economic OS for the internet,” said Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, in a press release. He pointed to the successful launch of the Arc public testnet in October, with participation from over 100 companies including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, AWS, and crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. In its statement, Circle noted that it is "exploring the possibility" of a native Arc token launch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues was pegged at $708.92 million, based off of predictions from four different analysts. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 17 cents per share, revised upward by 5 cents over the past 30 days. The company made its debut on the NYSE in June. Since the company went public, USDC's market capitalization has climbed from $61 billion to nearly $76 billion at the time of writing, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko. Analysts are expecting the stablecoin issuer will see a total of $2.68 billion in revenue this year. But that optimism wasn't evident in the company's share price heading into Wednesday. The company reported early Wednesday morning, before the opening bell in New York. Circle, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the CRCL ticker, closed on Tuesday at $98.30 after having fallen 5.57% during the session. About an hour before the company's earnings report, shares had fallen further to $94.04 in pre-market trading. The company is coming off a mixed Q2 report, when it reported a 53% increase in year-over-year revenue and a net loss of $4.48 per share. It was around that time the company unveiled plans for its L1 blockchain, Arc. The blockchain is optimized for stablecoin-focused applications. Arc will use USDC for gas, features a built-in FX engine, and enables opt-in privacy.

Title: Crypto Tokenization Under Scrutiny: Global Regulators Cite Risks Amid Split Opinions
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-tokenization-global-regulators-cite-risks/
Time Published: 2025-11-12T11:00:58Z
Full Content:
Cryptocurrencies linked to real-world assets (RWAs) are drawing scrutiny, as the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently warned that these innovations might introduce new risks for investors. In a report released on Tuesday, the global securities regulator highlighted that while many risks associated with tokenization fall under existing regulatory frameworks, new vulnerabilities may arise from the technology itself. Tokenization—essentially the creation of blockchain-based tokens that represent real-world assets like stocks or bonds—has gained renewed interest throughout the year. New tokenized products are increasingly being marketed to the public via online brokers. Tuang Lee Lim, chair of IOSCO’s board-level fintech taskforce, noted that while adoption levels remain modest, tokenization could fundamentally transform the issuance, trading, and servicing of financial assets. However, the regulator’s report points that the diverse ways in which tokenized assets are structured could create confusion for investors, leaving them uncertain about whether they own the underlying asset or merely the crypto token. Additionally, the existence of third-party token issuers adds layers of counterparty risk, a concern echoed by the European Union’s (EU) securities regulator in a similar report from September. IOSCO also cautioned that this new “vulnerability” could be exacerbated by increasing connections to the broader crypto asset market. Despite these risks, some mainstream financial institutions, including Nasdaq, are moving forward with tokenization initiatives. Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, remarked that tokenization offers an alternative method for holding assets like gold in a digital wallet, allowing for 24/7 trading and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers. He added that such innovations could serve as collateral for loans, offering a protective hedge against the depreciation of the US dollar. However, concerns persist among other Wall Street players. Although there has been rising commercial interest in tokenization, the International Organization of Securities Commissions pointed out that actual adoption remains limited. Proponents of tokenized assets argue that blockchain technology can reduce trading costs, expedite settlement times, and attract a younger demographic of investors. However, IOSCO cautioned that the purported efficiency gains are “inconsistent,” as market participants still rely on traditional market infrastructure to facilitate trading, rather than fully replacing it with blockchain technology. The report criticized issuers for failing to publicly disclose any measurable gains. In the US, the push for tokenization has gained momentum alongside new legislation this year, which has spurred a surge in stablecoin adoption. The crypto industry, along with major Wall Street figures, is eager to mainstream this trend. Vlad Tenev, CEO of crypto trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), recently described tokenization as an unstoppable “freight train.” Meanwhile, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, asserted in a summer newsletter that the concept of tokenization has the potential to revolutionize investing.

Or so it would seem. It’s no secret that ETF launches have exploded this year, with nearly 800 new funds hitting the market in the first nine months of 2025 alone, already ahead of last year’s total of 746. Asset flows have also climbed, with net year-to-date sales topping $1.1 trillion last month. On the other hand, closures have largely remained steady, with 266 funds shuttering in the first half of this year, compared with 253 in the first half of last year, according to ETFGI. But, experts said those numbers could rise as new products struggle to gain the assets needed to survive. “Am I concerned that there’s too many products coming out, and that some of them are going to close? Yes,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF trends research at VettaFi. “BlackRock or any other asset manager is not closing a popular ETF because they have too many of them. They’re pulling inventory off the shelf that isn’t selling to make room for something more likely to sell.” Despite issuers launching funds left and right, there’s reason to believe that new assets can keep up, at least for now. Certain strategies are more popular than others, with areas like spot bitcoin having more success because of the sheer amount of investor interest, said Greg Stumm, president and CEO of American Beacon Advisors. “There are 11 of these [spot bitcoin ETFs], and I’d originally thought that by this time, you’d have seen half of them close. But even the smaller ones are $500 million dollars,” Stumm said. Still, spaces that aren’t the size of crypto will see closures. “If you’re running the same product as someone else, how are you going to see that delta?” Stumm added. According to ETFGI, closures have been roughly on par with prior years: Circle of Life: Although they can be an inconvenience for investors, closures are part of the natural rhythm of the ETF industry, Rosenbluth said. It’s more of an opportunity cost for issuers to run unpopular or unprofitable funds. “Marketing efforts, sales efforts, listing fees: There are costs to running an ETF,” he added. “If you’ve got something waiting in the wings … it’s prudent to take something off the shelf and put something new on.” Fundstrat is back at the free throw line, this time with a small- and mid-cap ETF and another focused on income. Issuers are betting that advisors could benefit from exposure to a narrow slice of the aerospace defense industry.

ETF Upside sat down with Tuttle to discuss his approach to ETFs and what has him so interested in alien technology. ETFs that focus on clean energy investments in the US and globally have been outperforming the wider market this year, and by no small margin. The success of money market funds and their ETF counterparts has coincided with low interest rates and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Net flows of ETFs reached yet another record last month, and actively managed products also captured more market share. The pace of ETF launches and fund conversions is picking up, but there is a challenge to find shelf space at broker-dealers. Nearly a dozen ex-China funds have launched since 2023.

The deal with Beach Freeman Lim & Cleland represents Mercer’s first tax-only acquisition, as it looks to make tax a core offering. November 12, 2025 Mercer Advisors, the Denver-headquartered registered investment advisor with $90 billion in assets, has acquired Beach Freeman Lim & Cleland, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm, representing its first tax-only deal. Beach Freeman Lim & Cleland brings 20 tax professionals across offices in El Segundo, Irvine and Ontario, Calif. They serve clients across industries, including healthcare, real estate, law firms, construction, professional athletes and franchise businesses. Those professionals join Mercer, with full-time employees having the opportunity to own equity. The move is a significant step towards Mercer’s integration of tax services into financial management. Mercer is seeking to expand its planning and preparation capabilities through partnerships with tax firms. “This partnership reflects our strategic focus on tax as a cornerstone of our family office set of services,” said Jeremiah Barlow, chief solutions officer at Mercer Advisors. “Kendrick Mercer, who founded our firm 40 years ago, was himself a tax and estate attorney.” Mercer currently has a national tax team of more than 120 professionals. “[BFLC’s] culture of partnership and investing in CPA talent very much mirrors our own. We couldn’t be more excited to welcome them to the Mercer Advisors family,” Mercer President Daniel Gourvitch said in a statement. “Their strong client relationships and Southern California presence make them a valuable addition to Mercer Advisors as we scale our tax services in key markets.” Related:Boutique Consultancy Adds to RIA Launch Options for Breakaways Gourvitch joined Mercer in 2022 from BlackRock, where he was a managing director and global head of platform for its Aladdin business. He said one of the reasons he joined the RIA was to help build a wealth manager with the capabilities of a large, bank-owned firm, but with a fiduciary mindset. This follows news last month that Mercer acquired Singer Burke’s RIA, SB Capital Management, and Singer Burke Zimmer & Kogan, an accounting, tax, business and financial consultancy. They joined Mercer’s ultra-high-net-worth-focused Regis Group, a specialized team focused on clients with $25 million or more in investable assets. Mercer is majority-owned by Oak Hill Capital, Genstar Capital, Altas Partners and GIC, a global institutional investor.

Title: Opportunities abound for Thomas Clarkson after impressive rookie year
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/11/12/opportunities-abound-for-thomas-clarkson-after-impressive-rookie-year/
Time Published: 2025-11-12T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
A year on from his Test debut with Ireland and Thomas Clarkson still feels the jangle of nerves. Putting on the green shirt, walking into the stadium, hasn’t improved for the Irish prop. “Not that much more comfortable to be honest,” says Clarkson, who turned down an offer from Italy, for whom he qualifies through his Italian mother. Despite 12 months passing since he came off the bench for Finlay Bealham in Ireland’s win over Argentina in last year’s November internationals, he admits: “It is still nerve-racking playing. I’d like to think that I have progressed a decent bit, but it’s still pretty nerve-racking running out.” Clarkson scored a try for Ireland against Portugal in July, next thing he was flying to join the Lions in Australia. “It hasn’t really sunk in to be honest,” he says. “I’m still pinching myself a little bit. But it was unbelievable to get the chance to train and play with all those lads.” At 25, the former Blackrock College player is nine years Bealham’s junior. He is also one of the few players in the Ireland squad who wasn’t around during Joe Schmidt’s tenure. His focus over the last year has been on how to improve in order to muscle his way in on Bealham and Tadhg Furlong. But that pursuit has led him towards simplicity, he says. “I probably tried to simplify the game down a little bit in my head. I probably would have got overwhelmed trying to do everything perfectly and ended up doing nothing particularly well. “I just thought towards the end of the season if I’d pick three things that I was going to nail, it was gonna be ball carry, tackle and scrum. Then everything else that came off the back of that – whatever happened, happened.” There might be a start for Clarkson this weekend against Schmidt’s Wallabies, so it would seem sensible to keep doing what he’s been doing. “I just came off the summer and I just wanted to be involved in a few games now in November, and then build on from there,” he says. “I just wanted to make sure that if I got opportunities, I took them.” It’s worked so far.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs see $524M inflow as BlackRock and Fidelity lead gains

Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $524 million in net inflows on Tuesday, with BlackRock, the asset management giant, and Fidelity, the financial services leader offering spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products, leading the surge in institutional investment. Inflows reflect renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin amid broader market conditions. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products provide indirect exposure to crypto prices through traditional stock market exchanges. After several days of net outflows, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a sharp influx on November 11, pointing to a potential reversal of recent trends. Still, the prior week’s sustained outflows underscored ongoing caution among institutional investors. BlackRock and Fidelity are capitalizing on temporary market conditions to bolster their Bitcoin holdings as part of the ongoing mainstream integration of crypto assets.

Title: The Bitcoin Future Now Runs On Wall Street Inflows, BlackRock Exec Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-future-wall-street-inflows-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-11-12T04:00:43Z

BlackRock’s head of crypto, Robbie Mitchnick, says the gravitational center of Bitcoin’s market structure has shifted decisively from miner issuance to exchange-traded fund demand—and that’s why classic four-year “halving cycles” should command far less attention than they used to. In a Bankless interview released November 10, Mitchnick argued that the ETF era is now the dominant flow regime for BTC, even as leverage and short-term derivatives noise continue to whipsaw prices. “It’s not over,” Mitchnick said when asked whether the latest sell-off marked the end of Bitcoin’s current cycle. “This is the fifth cycle we’ve seen […] through each successive cycle, the level that Bitcoin reached was massively higher than the prior cycle.” He added a pointed caveat for anyone still treating halvings as the metronome of BTC: “A lot of people believe the cycle is tied to [the] Bitcoin halving. The Bitcoin halving at this point is almost totally irrelevant […] when ETFs are accumulating inflows, the magnitude of those inflows is many, many multiples larger than any change in supply created by a Bitcoin halving event.” Mitchnick’s framing puts Wall Street, not the protocol schedule, at the center of the next phase. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, “has been the fastest-growing ETF post-launch in history,” he said, reaching milestones at roughly four times the pace of the previous record. More telling than raw AUM, in his view, is the changing composition of holders. In the first quarter after launch, “IBIT was over 80% direct retail investors. Every quarter thereafter that number has come down […] today it’s close to 50%,” reflecting the steady rise of wealth advisory and institutional channels. That institutional cohort is still early, but broadening. “If you think about the big categories of institutional investors, you’ve got family offices, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, foundations, corporate treasurers, insurers, pension funds. You have some adopters in every one of those archetypes, but not the majority, not even close,” he said. For those allocating, typical position sizes land in the “1% to 3% range.” The gating factor, again, is less about custody or access—and more about how Bitcoin behaves inside a portfolio. “It’s all about correlation,” Mitchnick noted, recounting a conversation with a pension CIO who is “literally” watching that metric. If Bitcoin persistently tracks “digital gold” rather than “levered NASDAQ,” he argued, “it’s a slam dunk to put a couple percentage of portfolio allocation in it.” The tension is that short-term market action still looks like crypto. Mitchnick called the October 10 washout—roughly “$21 billion in liquidations”—a leverage event rather than a shift in fundamentals, and contrasted it with the steadiness of fund buyers: “What was the impact on ETF outflows? Tiny […] a couple hundred million.” That discrepancy, he said, is precisely why cycles should attenuate over time: a larger, slower-moving base of ETF and advisory capital can absorb derivatives-driven shocks without mechanically exiting. He also pushed back on narratives that Bitcoin’s 2025 underperformance versus gold invalidates the “uncorrelated hedge” thesis. The digital asset, he argued, already banked its “debasement trade” in late 2024, rallying from the “high $60s to over $100K,” and even notched a new all-time high around $126,000 before the October crash “derailed the momentum.” In other words, the year-to-date scoreboard reflects sequencing and leverage, not a structural repudiation of Bitcoin’s store-of-value pitch. On supply dynamics, Mitchnick acknowledged that legacy cohorts have taken profits at psychological levels, but he dismissed the idea that Bitcoin is in an “IPO moment” where early adopters permanently hand the float to institutions. What’s more plausible, he said, is simple risk management by ultra-early holders whose basis sits at “$100 or $500,” many of whom had $100,000 as a round-number trim target. “At some point you do have to take some chips off the table,” he said, adding that long-term performance has favored patience over short-term, levered trading. Mitchnick was careful not to oversell universal adoption among big pools of capital. Central banks, he suggested, remain a tail-risk buyer rather than a base case. The near-term path instead runs through the institutions already tiptoeing in—pensions, insurers, sovereign wealth funds—whose conviction will hinge on medium-term behavior and policy clarity. The message for allocators facing their first full drawdown with ETFs live was direct: don’t mistake derivatives noise for broken fundamentals, and be selective. “There’s a reason Bitcoin is still roughly 65% of the market cap of the space,” he said. “One has to be very wary going far down the table […] the vast majority of [tokens] are or will be totally worthless.” For Bitcoin, the test is whether it keeps behaving like what institutions think they’re buying. “People have to look beyond these short-term moves […] and more about, you know, medium and longer term how does it track,” Mitchnick said. At press time, BTC traded at $105,497. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin ETFs Pull In $300M as Traders Rush to Buy the Dip

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin ETFs snapped a two-week streak of redemptions by the end of day Tuesday U.S. time, with early data showing a posting $299.8 million in net inflows as investors rotated back into crypto-linked products. Data from SoSoValue shows Fidelity’s FBTC brought in $165.9 million, while Ark 21Shares (ARKB) added $102.5 million, and Grayscale’s BTC saw $24.1 million with others not yet reporting by publication time. The shift marks a notable contrast to last week’s data from CoinShares, which recorded $1.17 billion in outflows from digital asset investment products. Bitcoin listed products in the U.S. saw $932 million in redemptions, while Ether equivilents lost $438 million. By comparison, European markets continued to attract capital, with inflows of $41 million in Germany and $50 million in Switzerland, suggesting longer-term positioning outside the U.S. Altcoins, however, continue to buck the trend. Solana notched another $118 million of inflows last week, bringing its nine-week total to $2.1 billion, while HBAR and Hyperliquid posted smaller but steady gains, according to CoinShares' data. The pattern points to investors differentiating between core assets under macro pressure and emerging networks still seeing on-chain momentum. Kraken’s global economist Thomas Perfumo said Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain intact despite near-term volatility. “In approximately seven days, Bitcoin’s circulating supply will cross 19.95 million coins, 95 % of its max supply of 21 million coins,” he wrote in a note given to CoinDesk. The milestone underscores Bitcoin’s programmable scarcity and its long-term role as a “credibly neutral, globally accessible store of value.” While short-term price action continues to track U.S. liquidity expectations, Perfumo added that Bitcoin’s hard-money design and growing adoption drive long-term value accrual. Institutional investors appear to be reflecting that view: buying dips through ETFs, trimming exposure to high-beta assets, and maintaining allocations in what is increasingly seen as a structural portfolio asset rather than a speculative trade. BTC: Bitcoin rose 1.4% to around $103,000, recovering some of last week’s losses as ETF inflows and easing macro fears lifted sentiment. ETH: Ethereum gained 2.1% to $3,424, outperforming Bitcoin as traders rotated into majors following two weeks of fund outflows. Gold: Gold traded at $4,134.6, near record highs, as economist James Thorne warned the U.S. has crossed a fiscal “Rubicon” that could trigger a “Bretton Woods 2.0” reset revaluing gold to manage debt, while Barrick Mining’s $1.3 billion quarterly profit and dividend hike underscored how surging bullion prices are transforming the global financial landscape.

Stocks to watch on November 12: Tata Power, Indian Hotels, Tata Motors CV, BASF India, AWL Agri in spotlight SBI Securities: Tenneco India, a part of the Tenneco Group, is a supplier of critical, highly engineered, technology-intensive clean air, powertrain, and suspension solutions, with market-leading positions. The company effectively leverages the parent’s 5,000 patents and 7,500 trademarks to design and develop products suited for Indian OEMs. It is ready to leverage the rising trend of premiumization in the Indian Auto industry. At the upper price band of Rs 397, the issue is valued at FY25 P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples of 29.0x and 19.3x, respectively. We recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue. AUM Capital: TCAIL is a leading supplier of emission control solutions to major OEMs across India, well-positioned to benefit from the stricter Bharat Stage (BS) VI and upcoming BS VII norms.

Given the strong developments, we recommend SUBSCRIBING. Geojit Investments: At the upper price band of ₹397, TCAIL is valued at 29x FY25 P/E, which appears reasonable relative to peers. Supported by strong parentage, market leadership in clean-air and ride performance systems, established OEM partnerships, robust financials, and healthy return ratios, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on structural tailwinds in India’s auto sector, including premiumization and tightening emission norms. Hence, we recommend a ‘Subscribe’ rating for the long term. Published on November 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Tenneco Clean Air India Ltd, part of the US-based Tenneco Group, on Tuesday said it has raised Rs 1,080 crore from anchor investors, just a day before opening of its initial public offering (IPO) for public subscription. The anchor book saw participation from 58 entities including SBI Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, SBI Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Nomura Funds Ireland, Fidelity, BlackRock, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Goldman Sachs, according to a circular uploaded on BSE's website. Tenneco Clean Air India IPO opens today at ₹378-397 As per the circular, the company allocated a little over 2.72 crore equity shares at an anchor investor offer price of Rs 397 per share, raising a total of Rs 1,079.99 crore. Among these, more than 1.47 crore equity shares, or 54.15 per cent, were allocated to 17 domestic mutual funds, which have applied through a total of 41 schemes.

Title: Crypto ETFs Get Green Light to Stake Holdings as IRS Issues New Guidance

Time Published: 2025-11-12T01:00:02Z

The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have officially approved staking for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), marking a historic turning point for digital asset investing. Related Reading: Hedera Hashgraph Added To Google BigQuery Public Datasets The new guidance, issued under Revenue Procedure 2025-31, allows ETFs and trusts holding proof-of-stake (PoS) assets such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to stake their holdings and distribute staking rewards directly to investors, without jeopardizing their tax status. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the advances as a major step in keeping the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain innovation. The framework introduces a “safe harbor” for regulated funds, clarifying how staking rewards will be taxed and distributed. Investors will now pay taxes only when they take control of rewards, while the ETFs themselves remain exempt from trust-level taxation. Industry experts hailed the decision as the final piece of regulatory clarity needed to unlock institutional participation in staking. Analysts estimate the change could bring $3 billion to $6 billion in new inflows to staking-based crypto products within the next year. To qualify under the new framework, ETFs must meet specific conditions. Funds can only hold a single digital asset and cash, work with qualified custodians for key management, and engage independent staking providers to handle validator operations. This structure ensures investor protection while bridging traditional finance and decentralized blockchain systems. It mirrors earlier SEC approvals from September 2025, which cleared listing rules for crypto ETFs and confirmed that certain staking operations do not constitute unregistered securities. Bill Hughes, senior counsel at Consensys, said the policy “eliminates the biggest legal and tax uncertainty that kept institutions from integrating staking into regulated products.” The guidance, he added, gives fund sponsors confidence to offer yield-bearing ETFs that generate passive income for investors through network validation. Until now, U.S. fund managers had avoided staking due to regulatory ambiguity and fear of losing favorable tax treatment. With this guidance, both retail and institutional investors can earn 3–7% annual staking rewards on assets like ETH and SOL through ETFs, without running their own nodes or managing wallets. The announcement follows weeks of government inactivity during the record 40-day U.S. shutdown, making it one of the first major regulatory actions since the reopening. It signals a return to policy momentum and a broader embrace of digital assets by Washington. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dump Finally Over? Analyst Explains Why It Is Time To Invest Analysts believe this decision cements America’s position as a global leader in digital asset regulation, potentially sparking a new wave of staking-enabled ETFs from financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.

He was Head of Forex Institutional Sales and Trading for… More Info The highly focused development of the U.S.’s shale oil and gas sectors from the early 2010s transformed it from one of the world’s biggest importers of both into one of its leading exporters of both. But it did much more than this: it reversed the balance of energy power in the world from where it had been left at the end of the 1973 Oil Crisis. As forecasts for the demand for gas continue to surge on fears of further global conflicts and on the dramatic expansion of data centres around the globe, the Middle East is looking to expand its own gas production, particularly with a view to developing its own shale resources. The U.S., in this context, is seen by these countries – most notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – not as a future competitor but as a key knowledge resource, which is a status Washington is happy to adopt. After all, becoming an integral part of any country’s energy production on the ground is as good a way as any – and a lot better than most – to keep those relationships running to the U.S.’s best advantage. It is interesting to note at this point the circularity of history here, albeit with a twist. Prior to 1973/74, the global oil industry had effectively been run by a small group of Western oil firms known as the ‘Seven Sisters’, as detailed in my latest book on the new global oil market order. These firms – comprised of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (which changed its name in 1935 to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and is now BP), Royal Dutch Shell, three iterations of Standard Oil (Standard Oil of California, Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Standard Oil Company of New York), Gulf Oil, and Texaco -- were able to control oil exploration, development, transport and pricing for decades up to October 1973. At that point, OPEC members – led by Saudi Arabia -- plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia, began an embargo on oil exports to the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands in response to their support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War. By the end of the resulting Crisis, in March 1974, the price of oil had risen from around US$3 per barrel (pb) to nearly US$11 pb before settling down for a while, before trending higher again. This, in turn, stoked the fire of a global economic slowdown, especially felt in the West. The then-Saudi Minister of Oil and Mineral Reserves, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, highlighted that the extremely negative effects on the West of the oil embargo marked a fundamental shift in the world balance of power between the developing nations that produced oil and the developed industrial nations that consumed it. However, from that point onwards, the U.S. was determined to keep the power of these Middle Eastern countries in check, which it largely achieved through a policy variant of Henry Kissinger’s ‘triangular diplomacy’ that he advocated in formulating the dealings of the US with the two other major powers of the time, Russia and China. Kissinger served as National Security Advisor from January 1969 to November 1975 and as Secretary of State from September 1973 to January 1977. This variant was focused more on the simple ‘divide and rule’ principle that undermines opponents over time by playing one side off against the other, leveraging whatever fault lines ran through target areas at either a community, national or international level. These fault lines could be economic, political, or religious, or any combination thereof. This is what broadly marked U.S. policy in the Middle East up to the advent of its Shale Revolution. This in turn prompted the 2014-2016 Oil Price War with OPEC, again led by Saudi Arabia, which ultimately saw the U.S. triumphant, as also analysed in full in my latest book. Aside from any other lessons that may have been learned by senior OPEC member countries was that the U.S. had extraordinarily managed to transform its then-nascent shale oil sector at the time of the breakout of the 2014-206 Oil Price War into a lean, mean, low-cost oil production machine, with similar advances in its shale gas sector. It is precisely for this reason that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are now looking at Washington for help in developing their own shale resources. Riyadh was the first of the two to take the lead, with U.S. companies involved in the development of its landmark Jafurah shale gas development since around 2019. An early notable participant was the U.S.’s National Energy Services Reunited Corp., which has conducted large-scale hydraulic fracturing operations across the relevant sites. From an investment perspective, the U.S. has also played a key role in the shape of financial giant BlackRock, which led a consortium to invest around US$11 billion in Jafurah’s midstream infrastructure. As of now, Saudi Arabia’s goal is to boost its gas output by 80% by 2030. According to Saudi Aramco in its Q3 2025 financial statement released on 4 November, Phase 1 of the Jafurah Gas Plant is on track for completion this year. Production is forecast to reach a sustainable sales gas rate of 2.0 billion standard cubic feet per day by 2030. The UAE, meanwhile, has been developing shale gas reserves with a view to boosting energy supplies available to meet local power demands and with an eye on future exports. According to a recent comment from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) chief executive for upstream, Musabbeh Al Kaabi, the firm is utilising knowledge and methodology learned from U.S. hydraulic fracturing in its own fields and working with the U.S.’s EOG Resources Inc. to develop both oil and gas reserves. Ruwais remains a key location for its shale gas exploration activities, with the Ruwais Diyab Unconventional Gas Concession initially a joint venture between ADNOC and TotalEnergies, before the French firm reduced its stake to leave ADNOC as the lead operator as the project moved into full development phase. The target here is to produce 1 billion standard cubic feet per day before 2030. This project will work alongside Ruwais’ huge conventional oil refinery and a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility that is currently under construction. Overall, the plan is that Ruwais will add 9.6 million tons of annual gas export capacity, more than doubling ADNOC’s current production capability. Driving both countries gas production expansion plans are the continued importance of LNG in global energy markets and forecasts for surging demand for gas from global data centres, according to the firms involved. LNG has become the world’s key emergency energy source since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Unlike pipelined gas, LNG can be quickly bought in the market and then shipped expeditiously to wherever it is required. In the 12-month run-up to Russia’s invasion, China scrupulously – and with an apparently supernatural degree of ‘good luck’ -- signed multiple long-term LNG contracts at preferential prices, leaving it in an exceptionally advantageous position to weather the resultant storm of spiralling energy prices. Since then, the U.S. has ensured that those countries that had been highly dependent on Russian gas supplies – notably several countries in Europe – have since been able to secure long-term LNG contracts with other suppliers. Meanwhile, the forecasts are that artificial intelligence, cloud, and heatwave-driven power needs will drive 40-50% of incremental global gas demand to end-2040 at minimum. Moreover, according to industry projections, by that point data centre-related demand could add 150–200 billion cubic metres a year globally, a 3.6-4.9% increase over current global gas demand projections.

Title: Ethereum Is ‘The Infrastructure’ for Wall Street, Says Former BlackRock Executive

Full Content:
For Joseph Chalom, Ethereum ETH$3,541.12 isn't just another blockchain. It’s the infrastructure he believes Wall Street will eventually build on. Chalom, co-CEO of Sharplink and former head of digital assets at BlackRock, says the qualities financial institutions care most about — trust, security and liquidity — are all present in Ethereum. That’s why he’s betting his post-BlackRock career on it. “Ethereum has the majority of stablecoins, tokenized assets and high-quality smart contract activity,” Chalom told CoinDesk in an interview. “If you're going to digitize finance, you need a chain institutions can trust — and it’s Ethereum.” At BlackRock, Chalom spent 20 years helping scale the Aladdin platform, a cornerstone of the firm’s internal operations that became one of the largest portfolio and risk management systems in the finance industry. Later, he led BlackRock’s entry into the crypto space, backing Circle, launching the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, and investing in tokenization firm Securitize. That experience shaped his conviction in Ethereum’s design. He describes the blockchain as a “multi-purpose” platform — capable of supporting not just financial transactions, but lending, trading, NFTs and complex applications — in contrast to bitcoin, which he calls “a great store of value.” Ether’s native yield from staking also sets it apart. Unlike bitcoin, which sits idle in portfolios, ether generates 3% annual yield through Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism. “It’s a productive asset,” Chalom said. “And that productivity can be returned to shareholders.” At Sharplink, which holds over $3 billion worth of ether, Chalom is trying to prove just that. Nearly all of the company’s ether is staked. And through new partnerships with Consensys, Linea and EigenLayer, Sharplink is exploring “restaking” strategies to unlock additional yield — while keeping assets with regulated custodians. He says this kind of capital, held on balance sheets with no short-term redemption pressure, lets institutions offer DeFi-level returns without DeFi-level risk. “If you’re willing to lock duration, you can be the ‘L’ in total value locked,” Chalom said. “That opens up access to safer and better returns.” Sharplink is one of several digital asset treasury companies accumulating ether, but Chalom believes most will struggle to scale. Without strong trading volumes, clean balance sheets, and internal teams managing staking and investments, he says many treasuries will underperform. Chalom views Sharplink not as a break from his BlackRock career, but as a continuation of his mission: bridging traditional finance with the crypto ecosystem. “We spent decades building rails full of intermediaries,” he said. “Ethereum gives us a chance to rebuild those rails — faster, cheaper and more secure.” He doesn’t think of Ethereum as speculative tech. He sees it as the foundation for the next wave of digitized finance. “Over time,” he said, “we won’t call it DeFi or TradFi. We’ll just call it finance. And Ethereum will be the infrastructure underneath.” More For You OwlTing: Stablecoin Infrastructure for the Future Stablecoin payment volumes have grown to $19.4B year-to-date in 2025.

Title: Here’s why BlackRock thinks altcoin ETFs are ‘totally worthless’

BlackRock still hold $100B crypto despite the recent market correction The firm views a big chunk of the market as less valuable in the long run. As of writing, the asset manager had $100 billion in BTC and ETH. BlackRock has been conspicuously absent from the latest wave of altcoin ETF rush, particularly for Ripple [XRP] and Solana [SOL]. Some had speculated that the world’s largest asset manager may jump on the trend at the last minute, but the firm appears to be comfortable with just Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs. In a recent interview, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, said “most of the altcoins as worthless.” He added, “One has to be very wary going far down the table with hundreds of thousands of crypto assets today. The vast majority of those are or will be totally worthless.” He added that Bitcoin still dominates the space due to a clear product-market fit, investor narrative, and a large addressable market as a digital gold. Mitchnick also backed long-term holding of BTC over risky leveraged short-term trading. For his part, Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Mitchnick’s stance explained BlackRock’s reluctance to explore more coins. The firm debuted its iShares Bitcoin Trust Fund (IBIT) in early January 2024, followed by an ETH-based ETF product in the second half of last year. Due to the market correction, BlackRock currently holds about $84 billion worth of BTC and leads the ETF players, which now collectively control 6.8% of BTC’s total supply. Source: Dune Additionally, the firm holds $15 billion worth of ETH, translating to over $100 billion worth of overall crypto holdings. Before launching full-scale operations on crypto ETFs, BlackRock was already active in the industry behind the scenes. It has been the main manager for Circle’s USDC reserve assets. Now, the firm plans to double down on tokenizing all traditional financial products — stocks, bonds, ETFs, and so on. Its flagship tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, has grown to nearly $3 billion in market cap. In the past year alone, BUIDL attracted over $2.3 billion in inflows, dominating the tokenized treasuries segment. Source: RWA And the growth isn’t restricted to money market funds and stablecoins; on-chain stocks have also picked up momentum. It remains to be seen how expected SEC rules will impact the tokenized market.

Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

Title: Ethereum’s $200B tokenized asset base backs analysts’ calls for higher ETH price
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-dollar200b-tokenized-asset-base-backs-analysts-calls-for-higher-eth-price
Time Published: 2025-11-11T17:47:11Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s $200 billion tokenized economy, falling exchange supply and traditional finance footprint are fundamental factors that suggest ETH is undervalued. Key takeaways: Ethereum currently hosts $201 billion in tokenized assets, which is nearly two-thirds of the global total of $314 billion. Institutional growth led by BlackRock and Fidelity has driven a 2,000% surge in onchain fund AUM since 2024. ETH exchange supply hit a yearly low, hinting at investor accumulation and a stronger market floor. Ethereum's growing dominance in the tokenized asset landscape is reshaping how investors value its network fundamentals and its native token, Ether (ETH). As of Tuesday, tokenized assets across all blockchains amount to roughly $314 billion, with Ethereum accounting for $201 billion, nearly two-thirds of the market. This underscored its leading role as the most utilized settlement layer in crypto in 2025. Stablecoins continue to form the backbone of Ethereum’s network economy, representing the vast majority of transaction activity. Combined USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) issuance on Ethereum has sustained deep liquidity pools across DeFi, cross-border payments and exchanges, helping the network maintain one of the highest transaction throughputs in the industry. The expansion extends beyond stablecoins. Tokenized fund assets under management (AUM) on Ethereum has surged by nearly 2,000% since January 2024, driven by institutional entrants like BlackRock and Fidelity bringing traditional investment products onchain. Fidelity Digital Assets noted that, “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” The company highlighted that stablecoins have become a global medium of exchange, processing $18 trillion in volume over the past 12 months, even surpassing Visa’s annual throughput of $15.4 trillion. Meanwhile, RWAs have emerged as Ethereum’s fastest-growing category. Tokenized treasuries, funds and credit instruments on Ethereum now total $12 billion, representing 34% of the $35.6 billion global RWA market. Protocols such as Ondo, Centrifuge and Maple are fueling the surge by offering yields of 4%–6% on tokenized US Treasury exposure and secured lending products. Analytics platform Token Terminal noted that this expansion effectively anchors Ethereum’s $430 billion market capitalization to tangible onchain utility, noting that, “the market cap of tokenized assets on Ethereum has set the floor for ETH’s market cap.” Related: BitMine snapped up 34% more ETH last week as prices dipped Data from CryptoQuant pointed out that Binance, the largest Ether trading venue by volume, indicated that ETH exchange supply has declined sharply since mid-2025, hitting its lowest level since May 2024. After peaking in early summer, supply fell continuously through November, reaching about the 0.0327 level. This persistent outflow signals coins moving into cold storage or long-term wallets, a behavior typically associated with accumulation phases. Interestingly, this decline in exchange balances coincided with Ether’s price peaking near $4,500 to $5,000 in August and September before retracing to about $3,500 currently. Analysts noted that a reduced supply on exchanges tends to alleviate sell pressure, potentially setting the stage for price stabilization or renewed upside if investor risk appetite improves.

Title: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP

Time Published: 2025-11-11T17:00:28Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Behind Schwab’s $660M Deal for Private Asset Marketplace Forge
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/advisor/industry-news/behind-schwabs-660m-deal-for-private-asset-marketplace-forge/

Investors have bought and sold more than $17 billion in private company shares using the platform. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Inking a deal for private markets platform Forge was apparently just too Schwabvious to ignore. The massive retail brokerage Charles Schwab says the $660 million deal, announced last week, will help improve liquidity and transparency in private market investments. The brokerage firm that pioneered discount stock-trading will soon be offering shares in some of the world’s most dazzling unicorns — like Anthropic, OpenAI and SpaceX — all available to retail investors, advisors and institutions. “We’ve created a whole bunch of ways for clients to manage and create diversified portfolios,” Schwab CEO Rick Wurster told Advisor Upside at the Schwab Impact conference in Denver last week. “It’s an underwritten story about how much the industry has innovated around those topics. It may not be as glamorous as prediction markets and sports gambling, but I think a lot more impactful.” Forge already has 636,000 registered users, and more than 4,700 companies are available on the platform. However, fees can run from 2% to 4% of the total transaction size, with investment minimums starting at $5,000, according to Forge’s website. As public markets continue their impressive bull run, advisors are clamoring to ensure clients are as diversified as possible, said Jon Beatty, head of advisor services at Charles Schwab. “Companies are staying private longer, and so the opportunity is there [for advisors] to participate in those organizations, to express their views of the economy, and the investment theses that they develop for their clients,” he told Advisor Upside at the conference. Private investing may become a staple in client portfolios, not to mention a gold mine for asset managers and brokerages alike. By 2030, retail investors’ allocations to private capital in the US could skyrocket to $2.4 trillion, according to a recent report by Deloitte. Just last month, Morgan Stanley agreed to buy EquityZen, a company that offers similar private-stock investments. They’re hardly alone: Private or Not. The Forge deal notwithstanding, Schwab’s recent growth has been staggering, with much of it being fueled by the company’s wealth business. “We’re the leading custodian; there’s not really a close second,” Wurster said, adding that the segment grew 40% year over year through the third quarter. “What we can bring to the advisors is unmatched on the wealth side, and that has been a source of significant growth for us.” While older investors might not be as tuned into prediction markets, some in the wealth industry fear they’re a growing threat to next-generation clients. Increased regulation could hurt the potentially high-returns that make private markets so attractive in the first place. Not all advisors are equipped to maximize enterprise value. The move comes before the bank’s full rollout of its tokenization platform next year. The investment bank has acquired EquityZen, giving Morgan Stanley clients greater access to private company investments. That works out to an additional $56 per retirement payment, bringing the average monthly benefit to more than $2,000. Private equity, private credit and real assets — such as real estate and infrastructure — all serve different purposes in client portfolios. As mega RIAs get bigger, some advisors are saying that the independent channel is beginning to look a lot like Wall Street. Florida-based Hinck Private Wealth Management is the latest formerly Commonwealth team to join Osaic’s growing network of RIAs. SIFMA called the current regulations burdensome, costly and unnecessary. Sub-acquisitions made up 31% of all RIA M&A activity in 2025 amid rampant private equity investment in the industry. Private equity and venture funds now account for roughly 12% of investments in the US. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: U.S. Treasury greenlights staking for crypto ETFs
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-s-treasury-greenlights-staking-for-crypto-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T22:10:44Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Treasury has approved staking for crypto ETFs. The decision provides long-awaited clarity for asset managers, paving the way for yield-bearing ETFs by mid-2026. It officially allows U.S.-listed crypto ETFs to stake proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum and Solana and distribute staking rewards to investors. It levels the playing field between ETFs and direct crypto holders, enabling investors to earn passive yields within regulated products. The U.S. Treasury and IRS issued landmark guidance on 10 November, allowing crypto exchange-traded products [ETP] to stake digital assets and share rewards with retail investors. The safe harbor rules published in Revenue Procedure 2025-31 end months of regulatory uncertainty for major asset managers waiting to add yield-generating features to their Ethereum and Solana ETFs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the guidance would “increase investor benefits, boost innovation, and keep America the global leader in digital asset and blockchain technology.” Source: X Staking enables proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana, to validate network transactions. Validators earn rewards for securing the blockchain. Until today, U.S. crypto ETFs have been unable to participate in staking, despite direct crypto holders earning these yields. The new guidance changes that completely. ETFs can now stake their holdings through qualified custodians like Coinbase Custody, BitGo, or Gemini, who work with validator operators to earn rewards. The ETFs must distribute these rewards to investors at least quarterly. This gives regulated products a major advantage. Ethereum ETF holders can now earn staking yields through traditional brokerage accounts without managing validators or private keys themselves. Major issuers have been anticipating this moment since February. The SEC repeatedly delayed decisions, pushing deadlines from April to June, then to October. Asset managers waited anxiously while their non-staking ETFs underperformed direct Ethereum holdings by the foregone staking yield. Grayscale shareholders approved staking amendments in September, demonstrating investor demand for yield-bearing crypto products. BlackRock held closed-door meetings with the SEC earlier this year, adding to speculation that approval would eventually come. The safe harbor includes strict requirements. ETFs must trade on national securities exchanges, maintain 85% liquidity for redemptions, and stake only through unrelated third-party providers at arm’s length terms. The guidance protects trusts from slashing penalties where validators lose staked assets for misconduct. Existing ETFs have a nine-month window starting today to amend their trust agreements. This means Ethereum ETFs could begin staking by mid-2026. Solana ETFs is the latest, launched on 28 October. However, these funds launched without staking capabilities due to regulatory uncertainty. Today’s guidance provides the clear framework these issuers need. The Solana ETFs can now amend their trust agreements within the nine-month window to add staking, offering investors exposure to SOL’s higher yields of approximately 5-7% annually alongside the existing Ethereum funds. The guidance marks a significant shift in U.S. crypto regulation. Asset managers can finally compete with direct crypto ownership by offering institutional-grade staking through traditional investment vehicles.

Title: World’s largest asset managers’ AUM surges to record $140 trillion, driven by North America and passives
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/11/10/3185106/0/en/World-s-largest-asset-managers-AUM-surges-to-record-140-trillion-driven-by-North-America-and-passives.html
Time Published: 2025-11-10T21:59:00Z
Full Content:
November 10, 2025 16:59 ET | Source: Willis Towers Watson US LLC Willis Towers Watson US LLC NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Total assets under management (AUM) at the world’s 500 largest asset managers reached USD 139.9 trillion at the end of 2024, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, according to new research from leading global advisory, broking and solutions company, WTW’s (NASDAQ: WTW) Thinking Ahead Institute. This marks a continued recovery for the asset management industry with total assets now back above the record that was last set in 2021. This recovery was driven largely by managers in North America who registered the fastest growth, up 13% year-on-year and accounting for USD 88.2 trillion, or 63% of total AUM among the top 500 firms. Japan registered a decline from its asset managers, with AUM falling by 9.5% in 2024, highlighting regional disparities in economic and investment performance. On current growth rates, the UK, which was the second largest asset management market in 2019, now looks likely to fall to fourth position in the next five years, with France and Canada set to overtake it. Strategically, the industry is continuing to undergo a significant shift to passive investment strategies, which now account for 39.0% of total AUM, a 6.1% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, actively managed assets declined to 61%, down 3.6% year-on-year. The top 20 asset managers further consolidated their influence, now controlling 47% of total AUM, up from 45.5% in 2023. Their combined assets rose to USD 65.8 trillion, with 15 US-based firms representing 83.9% of this segment. Among these, BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity Investments retained their positions as the top three global managers, with BlackRock holding the top spot since 2009. This study also highlights the rapid rise of private-market specialists, whose AUM growth has outpaced traditional managers. For example, Brookfield’s AUM grew from USD 240 billion in 2017 to USD 1,061 billion in 2024 - an impressive 20% annualized increase over eight years and a rise of 46 places in the rankings, driven by investor demand for private credit, infrastructure, and real estate strategies. Across the regions, the Middle East has gained prominence as a strategic hub for asset managers, as regulatory reforms in the UAE, including updates to digital assets rules and the Qualifying Investment Funds regime, are attracting global firms to financial centres like the Dubai International Financial Centre and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, thematic opportunities in Shariah-compliant investing, ESG, and digital assets are aligning with national transformation agendas, making the region increasingly competitive. Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence continues to become an enabler across the industry, with the study finding that 47% of firms are investing in AI for strategic, operational customer improvement purposes. However, adoption remains in its early stages, with 78% of firms allocating less than 10% of their tech budgets to AI. Despite this, the study did find 61% expect AI spending to grow over the next five years, whilst a similar number (64%) expressed concern about AI-related cyber risks. “This study paints a vivid picture of an industry in transition,” said Jessica Gao, Director of The Thinking Ahead Institute. We’re seeing a convergence of forces, from the rise of passive strategies and private markets to the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence. These trends are reshaping the very foundations of asset management.

Easton, Maryland-based TeraWulf attributed the gain to Bitcoin's rising price, expanded mining capacity, and the start of high performance performance computing lease revenue. “The third quarter into the fourth has been remarkably busy for TeraWulf,” Paul Prager, TeraWulf chief executive officer, said in a statement, highlighting the a growing partnership with Fluidstack and Google. "These transactions demonstrate the strength of our platform and the trust that world-class technology partners place in our ability to execute." He added: “We are squarely focused on execution while advancing the next phase of growth for 2027 and beyond." Terawulf, which trades on the Nasdaq under the WULF ticker, was down 2.5% in after-hours trading Monday. WULF closed at $14.30, a 3.8% gain for the day. Over the past month, the company’s share price has climbed 7.6%. Preliminary guidance from Terawulf issued in late October said the company expected to report between $48 million and $52 million in revenue for Q3, representing an approximate 84% increase compared to the $27 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. TeraWulf went public through a merger with IKONICS in December 2021. At the time, it was more of a straightforward Bitcoin mining play. By late 2024, the company had started positioning itself to building "high-performance AI compute infrastructure." In August, Terawulf announced that it had struck a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack. The deal represents $3.7 billion in contract revenues, but could more than double to $8.7 billion through lease extensions. As part of the deal, Google signed on to backstop $1.8 billion worth of the AI firm’s lease obligations. In return, the Silicon Valley giant received 41 million shares worth of TeraWulf common stock, representing approximately an 8% pro forma equity ownership stake. "This is exactly the evolution we outlined: converting advantaged infrastructure positions into contracted megawatts with investment-grade counterparties and doing so at strategic scale," Prager said about the deal at the time. The deal gives Google a corporate stake that’s second only to Prager himself, who controls 10.7% of shares. The firm’s other institutional investors include Stammtisch Investments, Bayshore Capital, and Revolve Capital. Vanguard Group and BlackRock hold large positions too, but as passive index fund managers. The firms hold positions in nearly every U.S. publicly traded company.
