Title: Who’s Kevin Hassett, Trump’s reported crypto-friendly pick for the Fed?

Time Published: 2025-11-26T15:37:30Z

Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, has reportedly emerged as a leader among the Trump administration’s short list to replace Jerome Powell. US President Donald Trump is slated to choose a new Federal Reserve chair by Christmas, and the frontrunner, Kevin Hassett, could be a boon for the crypto industry. Hassett is a White House economic adviser who has reportedly emerged as a strong candidate for the Fed chair position. He is the director of the National Economic Council and oversaw the digital asset working group directed by the White House earlier this year. Trump has been trying to increase his administration’s control over the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, thereby expanding the White House’s influence over monetary policy. The nomination process has not yet begun, but observers are already speculating about what a Hassett chairmanship could mean for US monetary policy and crypto. Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at the Columbia Business School in the 1990s. While there, he also served as an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was also a policy consultant with the Department of the Treasury under the administrations of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Hassett briefly sat on the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the first Trump administration. During the president’s second term, Hassett served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC), a part of the executive branch that the president uses for setting domestic and international economic policy. Despite a lack of clear public statements, Hassett is widely regarded as pro-crypto. In June, he revealed a stake of at least $1 million in Coinbase and that he was compensated at least $50,001 for his role on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. The NEC, where he serves as director, oversaw the development of the White House’s digital asset working group, which published a paper earlier this year outlining the administration’s policy on crypto. The Fed doesn’t oversee securities or commodities, so its policy changes can’t affect crypto regulation. But a crypto-friendly Fed could still have a positive impact on the industry in several ways. Related: Bitcoiners perk up as odds of a December Fed rate cut almost double Firstly, lower interest rates generally mean better crypto prices. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that the implications for markets are “strongly bullish.” He called Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts.” Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset investment platform Grayscale, said, “On the margin Hassett should be considered positive for crypto => supports rate cuts, past Coinbase advisor, NEC director during White House crypto policy push.” The Fed also regulates banks, namely bank holding companies, payment system access, reserve requirements and liquidity and risk rules. Tightening or loosening these rules could affect crypto companies’ access to a number of services, including: Crypto custody Lending against crypto collateral Access to payment rails Stablecoin issuer requirements vis-à-vis banking regulations Settlement rules. Still, the White House has yet to make a clear nomination. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced in late October that Hassett was on a short list of five nominees to replace Jerome Powell. These included former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. A nomination is expected by Christmas. Trump has been attempting to assert more control over the Federal Reserve as a means to exert greater influence over his preferred monetary policies. Earlier this year, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Her refusal to step down sent the case to the Supreme Court, which, for the time being, has allowed her to stay on. In a court filing, Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the attempt a “broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System.” The Council of Foreign Relations has lauded the independence of this system, stating that it “shields the Federal Reserve from undue political influence, such as pressure from the White House to lower interest rates ahead of an election, which could offer short-term political gains but cause long-term economic harm.” An independent Fed also “enhances the Fed’s credibility” and makes the market more confident in its decisions. “Crucially, it also empowers the Federal Reserve to take difficult but necessary actions, even when they are unpopular.” John Authers, a senior editor for markets and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote that choosing Hassett “appears to be about loyalty.” George Pollack, a senior US policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, reportedly said that Trump will nominate Hassett “because of his confidence that Hassett will be the candidate most likely to support the administration’s priorities.” Were the Fed to become another arm of the administration, the results could be good for crypto markets in the short term but disastrous elsewhere. Lower-than-needed interest rates could score cheap political points but lead to increased inflation. The Center for American Progress explained, “Knowing that the rates will be based on well-researched data, and not political whims, assures the world that the U.S. economy will remain relatively stable and its markets will remain rational.” Magazine: Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Texas Drops $10 Million On Bitcoin, Officially Buying The Dip First

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Next week could decide whether SEC lets your Apple shares live on-chain — with the same protections

Time Published: 2025-11-26T14:09:40Z

The Investor Advisory Committee will probe how issuance, trading, and settlement could work under existing rules. Here’s the practical path and the roadblocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Dec. 4 meeting of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee opens with a question the agency has spent years avoiding: “What does it actually look like when publicly traded equities live on a blockchain?” Not as wrapped derivatives on offshore exchanges, not as speculative tokens detached from shareholder rights, but as registered securities trading inside the same regulatory framework that governs Apple shares today. The two-hour panel, titled “Tokenization of Equities: How Issuance, Trading, and Settlement Would Work with Existing Regulation,” assembles market-structure architects from Nasdaq, BlackRock, Coinbase, Citadel Securities, Robinhood, and Galaxy Digital to sketch that path in public for the first time. The timing reflects pressure the SEC can no longer deflect. Nasdaq recently filed a formal proposal to trade tokenized versions of listed stocks alongside traditional shares on the same order book, arguing that blockchain settlement requires no carve-outs from the national market system. Commissioner Hester Peirce made clear in July that tokenization “does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset.” Additionally, tokenized securities remain securities and are subject to the full federal regime. What Dec. 4 tests is whether that framing can survive contact with implementation details: Who holds the keys? How does the NBBO work when trades settle in seconds instead of two days? Can you short a token the same way you short a share? Nasdaq’s blueprint offers the clearest view of what “inside the system” tokenization looks like. The exchange proposes allowing listed equities to trade in either traditional digital form or as tokens, with both versions sharing the same CUSIP, execution priority, and economic rights. The token lives at the settlement layer. Issuers still register under the Securities Act, exchanges still operate under the Exchange Act, broker-dealers still route orders through consolidated feeds, and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) still guarantees delivery. Blockchain replaces the back-end ledger, not the front-end rulebook. That structure keeps tokenized equities inside Regulation NMS, which means trades still contribute to the national best bid and offer, market makers still face quote obligations, and surveillance still flags wash trades and spoofing. Nasdaq warns that parallel venues outside NMS would fragment liquidity, undermine price discovery, and leave issuers blind to where their stock actually trades. The filing explicitly rejects exemptions: tokenization is a settlement technology, not a new asset class that warrants lighter-touch oversight. On settlement, Nasdaq points to DTC building blockchain infrastructure so token trades can clear on-chain while the exchange’s matching engine and data feeds remain unchanged. If that plumbing arrives on schedule, live trading could start as early as the third quarter of next year. The model assumes that transfer agents maintain tokenized registers the same way they maintain book-entry registers today, with the same custody standards and financial responsibility rules, just with a different database underlying them. The Dec. 4 agenda flags a distinction the crypto press often collapses: natively issued tokenized shares versus wrapper structures. Native tokens mean the issuer itself places equity on-chain or directs its transfer agent to maintain a blockchain register, conveying full voting rights, dividend claims, and liquidation preferences. Wrapper tokens, common on offshore platforms, offer only economic exposure: price goes up, investors profit, but they can’t vote the shares or sue in a derivative action. Nasdaq’s filing uses European venues as a cautionary tale. Tokens tracking Apple and Amazon traded there at prices wildly divergent from the underlying stock, required no issuer consent, and granted holders neither voting rights nor liquidation rights. When those tokens crashed, buyers discovered they owned synthetic derivatives, not shares. The exchange argues that letting such products proliferate without registration would gut investor protections and create a shadow equity market that regulators can’t see. The panel will probe how ownership rights flow through tokenized structures, not because the SEC is confused about what a share is, but because wrapping introduces intermediaries who may or may not pass through governance and economic rights. If a token only tracks price, it can start to resemble a security-based swap, triggering different disclosure and margining rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) commentary explicitly stated that investors must retain the same legal and beneficial ownership in tokenized form, or the product morphs into something entirely different. The Dec. 4 agenda spans a spectrum of regulatory friction. At the low-friction end are issuers registering tokenized shares, listing them on national securities exchanges, and trading them interchangeably with traditional digital shares, as Nasdaq proposes. Existing statutes already permit that if tokenization is treated as a settlement method rather than a product innovation. Blockchain as record-keeping technology also fits, provided registered clearing agencies and transfer agents meet current custody and books-and-records standards. Earlier SEC staff statements on digital asset custody frame this as compliance engineering, not boundary-pushing. At the high-friction end, there is actual 24/7 trading of listed equities, which collides with Reg NMS assumptions about market hours and consolidated data. Regulators float 24/7 markets in the crypto context, but applying that to tokenized Apple shares means rewriting how best execution works when New York sleeps and Tokyo trades. Models where tokenized equities trade only on non-NMS blockchain venues, unregistered as exchanges or alternative trading systems, also clash with existing rules. Nasdaq and SIFMA both argue that allowing equity volume to migrate to unconnected platforms would shred the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and leave retail investors with stale quotes. Senate work on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act points in the opposite direction, explicitly classifying tokenized stocks and bonds as securities and cementing SEC oversight. That suggests any attempt to treat tokenized shares as outside the agency’s remit will hit legislative headwinds, not tailwinds. The Investor Advisory Committee can submit findings and recommendations, but it does not write rules. The panel is a stress test to see if Coinbase, Citadel Securities, and Nasdaq can agree on what compliant tokenization looks like when they’re forced to reconcile custody models, interoperability standards, and short-selling mechanics in the same room. If they can, the SEC gains a reference architecture for evaluating filings like Nasdaq’s. If they can’t, the agency learns where the technical or incentive mismatches sit before approving anything. What the panel won’t do is approve Nasdaq’s proposal, rewrite the definition of a security, or bless offshore stock tokens that skip issuer consent. It also won’t resolve whether 24/7 trading or cross-chain interoperability requires new exemptive relief, as those questions depend on engineering details the advisory body isn’t equipped to answer. At most, Dec. 4 yields a menu of options the Commission can reference when deciding whether tokenized equities belong in the national market system or require a parallel structure that current law doesn’t yet contemplate. The meeting matters because it forces the question into the open. The answer still depends on whether the market wants to retrofit blockchain into existing rails or build new ones, and the SEC has to authorize it from scratch.

Title: Texas Allocates $5M into BlackRock’s $BTC ETF as Bitcoin Hyper Raises Over $28.5M
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/texas-bitcoin-etf-bet-boosts-bitcoin-hyper-interest/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T10:26:03Z

Quick Facts: When a US state buys the dip, people pay attention. Texas just allocated $5M into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ($BTC) ETF while $BTC trades well below its all-time high. This signals that state-level capital still sees asymmetric upside in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. If you’re a crypto investor, that’s a strongly bullish message. That’s because when public institutions step in during a pullback, they’re effectively saying volatility is a feature, not a deal-breaker. But simply holding $BTC on a centralized ETF rail isn’t where the real innovation is happening. The next leg of the cycle is increasingly about what can be built on top of Bitcoin: scaling, programmability, and yield-generating infrastructure. That’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) become appealing to more aggressive risk-takers looking to ride institutional narratives. Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, attempting to blend Bitcoin’s settlement finality with Solana-style performance. If you’re watching Texas buy the ETF dip, the thesis is straightforward: if state treasuries are comfortable with base-layer $BTC, the upside may shift toward infrastructure that unlocks high-speed payments, DeFi, and dApps on top of that base. Texas’s spot Bitcoin ETF allocation strengthens $BTC’s role as a long-term store-of-value rather than just a speculative trade. The catch is that Bitcoin’s base layer still processes 7-10 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes. Meanwhile, its fees regularly spike into several dollars during congestion. For everyday payments, on-chain DeFi, and gaming, that user experience can’t compete with newer high-throughput chains like Solana that finalize in seconds for fractions of a cent. That gap has triggered a flood of Bitcoin scaling plays: Lightning for peer-to-peer payments, sidechains like Rootstock and Liquid for smart contracts, and emerging rollup-style or L2 concepts to add programmability anchored in Bitcoin-level secure settlement. As more institutional money holds passive $BTC exposure via ETFs, the opportunity space shifts to these L2 projects attempting to make Bitcoin usable, not just investable. Within that landscape, Bitcoin Hyper sits alongside other Bitcoin L2 contenders but takes a more aggressive approach by importing SVM semantics and Solana-style tooling onto a Bitcoin-secured execution layer. Where Bitcoin Hyper tries to stand out is in raw performance. The project positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-fast transaction throughput and low-latency execution while still anchoring finality back to Bitcoin Layer 1. In practice, that means sub-second block times, rapid confirmation, and fees targeted in the sub-cent range for routine transfers. Under the hood, the architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and periodic state anchoring, while a high-speed SVM-based Layer 2 processes execution in real time. A single sequencer orders transactions and commits them back to Bitcoin, while a decentralized canonical bridge allows $BTC holders to move value onto the L2 as wrapped assets. SPL-compatible token standards are adapted for this environment, giving Rust developers a familiar model to build swaps, lending protocols, and NFT or gaming primitives. From an adoption standpoint, the team is leaning on tokenonomics and early traction to draw capital. The presale has already raised over $28.5M, with tokens at $0.013335, indicating that a growing number of investors is already investing in SVM-on-Bitcoin narratives. Whales are particularly interested in the project. Less than two weeks ago, one purchased a little over $500K worth of $HYPER tokens, which is the strongest signal of support yet on Bitcoin Hyper. Long-term, $HYPER token could explode, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. That’s about a 1,399% increase from its current price. Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition is simple: if states like Texas are bullish on Bitcoin, then an L2 that builds upon $BTC’s infrastructure can only soar in popularity. But with a price increase coming up a day from now, it’s best to act quickly and lock in $HYPER at a discounted price. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is wrapping up the second round of interviews for the next Federal Reserve Chair. He added that there is a strong possibility President Donald Trump will reveal his choice before Christmas. (Source: Reuters) White House adviser Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as the leading contender, according to a Bloomberg report. Hassett, like Trump, believes interest rates should be lower than they are under current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent explained that the selection has been narrowed from eleven names to five strong candidates. He said the final interviews focused on how each candidate would manage what has become a very complicated institution. The White House dismissed the Bloomberg scoop, calling any discussion about the Fed nomination speculative until the president makes an official announcement. Along with Hassett, the shortlist includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Governor Michelle Bowman, who also serves as vice chair for supervision, and Rick Rieder, the global fixed-income chief at BlackRock. Betting platforms Kalshi and Polymarket showed a neck-and-neck contest between Hassett and Waller. Waller’s odds improved sharply after he said he had a strong second interview with Bessent. After the Bloomberg report, bets began shifting heavily towards Hassett across both platforms. Each market assigned him around a 50% probability of being chosen. The Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates at its last two meetings, and markets expect another cut in December. The benchmark rate is currently in the 3.75% to 4.00% range. Waller and Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, have argued since the summer that the greater risk lies in a weakening job market rather than rising inflation. They both dissented at the July meeting in favour of a rate cut.

Title: Bitcoin Recovery From Worst Of Selloff Holds, Buoying Traders

Time Published: 2025-11-26T02:41:20Z

The intense selling pressure that has weighed on Bitcoin in recent weeks looks to be easing, raising hopes that the token’s brutal slide is nearing an end. The original cryptocurrency was little changed at around $88,000 on Tuesday, well above last week’s slump that consigned it to a seven-month low, triggering massive liquidations and erasing more than $1 trillion in value from the broader digital-asset market. The mood among traders remains cautious, highlighting the market’s fragile state. Bitcoin remains on track for its worst month since 2022, and exchange-traded funds investing in the token look likely to record their heaviest monthly outflows since launching. But after Bitcoin’s modest rebound, some see cause for optimism. In the Bitcoin options market, the cost of purchasing downside protection has fallen sharply, with the premium for one-week puts over calls sliding to around 4.5% from a 2025 high of 11% reached on Friday, according to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. “This indicates the level of stress has come down significantly, and investors expect we’ve seen the bottom for now,” she said. Another metric drawing attention is Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index, now at 32 after a steep decline from early October. A reading of 30 or below typically signals an oversold asset while 70 or above indicates the opposite. Meanwhile, implied volatility on Bitcoin options — a gauge of expected future price movement — has returned to April levels, when tariff news induced a wave of selling. “This suggests traders are positioning for a breakout, which could of course be in either direction,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. “But options skew shows that the bets on further drops are softening relative to those on a price increase from here.” Global crypto exchange-traded products have seen more than $6 billion in outflows so far in November, the largest monthly withdrawal on record going back to 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Even so, investors are largely staying put. The US Bitcoin ETFs’ combined redemptions of $3.7 billion in November represent about 3% of their $110 billion in assets. For BlackRock Inc.’s Bitcoin fund (IBIT), short interest — measured by the dollar value of shares sold short — has plummeted, according to a report published by S3 Partners LLC. BTC Markets Analyst Rachael Lucas noted that Bitcoin’s muted trading on Monday could also indicate that selling pressure is subsiding. She sees $80,000 as the near-term floor, with $90,000 to $95,000 forming the resistance band to any meaningful rebound. US stocks climbed after the tech sector trimmed the sharp decline it suffered earlier in the session as traders contended with the AI chip rivalry between Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. Investors have put the chances of a rate cut at the upcoming December meeting of the Federal Reserve at about 80%, up from 42% a week ago, according to futures contracts. Fed officials appear deeply divided over whether another reduction would be appropriate, following cuts in September and October. “The market is going to be in wait-and-see mode until the Fed’s decision,” Orbit’s Mauron said. “Long-term holders who were exiting their position over $100,000 are seeing current levels as too low to sell and are back in holding mode, while those looking to accumulate new positions may try to wait for another dip below $85,000.” As investors contend with a mix of concerns from a cooling US labor market to surging artificial-intelligence capital spending by major corporations, a risk appetite gauge maintained by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has fallen to zero. The reading signals mounting pressure on speculative assets, including Bitcoin. A drop of this magnitude reflects fading risk enthusiasm and, at extreme levels, may even suggest that markets have overshot to the downside. “Elevated equity valuations and bullish positioning increased vulnerability to shocks, especially within more retail-driven segments such as Unprofitable Tech,” wrote strategists at the bank including Christian Mueller-Glissmann.

Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next financial revolution, and Ondo Finance has a big role to play. The Figure Technology YLDS addition strengthens and diversifies the OUSG yield sources, whose portfolio already includes funds from trusted asset managers. News of the BNB Chain expansion and the EU regulatory approval did little to stem the selling pressure behind the Ondo ecosystem token. Ondo Finance [ONDO] announced the purchase of $25 million of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions. Terming it a strategic investment, the addition will enhance and diversify the yield source supporting OUSG. OUSG (Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries) is the flagship product of Ondo Finance. OUSG has more than $780 million in total value locked (TVL) and gives investors exposure to U.S. Treasuries. It offers 24/7 redemption with an estimated annual return of 3.68%. In addition, its multi-chain support expands accessibility for a wider range of users. The recent purchase adds to the reserve portfolio, which already has tokenized Treasury products from well-known asset managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity. In October, Ondo Finance expanded its tokenized asset offerings to the BNB Chain. An announcement from the network read that over 100 tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) went live. On the 18th of November, the company stated that it had received regulatory approval to bring its products to the European Union (EU) and the broader European Economic Area (EEA). Ondo Finance had obtained authorization from the Lichtenstein Financial Market Authority, a well-established European regulator. This development meant the company’s tokenized stocks and ETFs were available to European investors and ensured it operated within the EU regulatory framework, adding to safety and appeal. Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next global financial revolution. If this prediction comes true, the Ondo Finance brand would likely keep growing in the coming years. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView Despite the bullish developments behind Ondo Finance, the token faced steady selling pressure. The CMF showed that capital flow has been outwards for most of November. The MFI agreed, and has sunk below 20 in recent days. This showed seller dominance, something the price action confirms. The 1-day timeframe’s ONDO structure was firmly bearish, and has been since the second half of September. The $0.5-$0.55 area was a long-term support zone from August to September 2024, but was breached and now acts as resistance.

Title: Custody shuffle continues as 87,464 more Bitcoin leaves institution-tagged wallets in 24 hours

Data flagged by Timechainindex shows large transfers from ETF and custodian addresses, likely re-custody rather than sell pressure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Timechain Index founder Sani reported 87,464 BTC flowing out of institution-tagged wallets between Nov. 21 and Nov. 22, adding that he hadn’t seen such movement in months. The raw data showed over 15,000 BTC leaving tracked cohorts on Nov. 21 alone, the largest single-day outflow since June 26. Yet, as Sani clarified in a note, the headline figure overstates actual selling pressure. Most of the movement represents internal reshuffling rather than institutions exiting Bitcoin positions. Sani explained that pre-processed data can show extreme volatility when large holders move coins between custodians or wallets, but after reconciliation, the net flows often land near zero. Strategy accounted for 49,907 BTC of the tracked outflows, but CEO Michael Saylor confirmed the company sold no Bitcoin that week. In fact, Strategy added 8,178 BTC last week, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sani’s assessment indicates that Strategy transferred holdings to new custodians to diversify risk, with some coins appearing in addresses linked to Fidelity Custody. Additionally, that’s the second time the firm has performed such a movement. This is not unique to Strategy. Sani shared that BlackRock moved Bitcoins out of their known addresses twice as well. The first time happened last year, and the second occurred a few weeks ago, when they moved nearly 800,000 BTC to new addresses. Additionally, Coinbase also reshuffled a similar amount this weekend in a UTXO consolidation exercise. Back to the over 15,000 BTC in outflows, Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt on Nov. 21, shedding 10,426 BTC as issuers processed redemptions tied to $903 million in net withdrawals reported Nov. 20. ETF outflows translate directly to liquidations, as fund managers must sell the underlying Bitcoin to meet shareholder exit requests. Still, the scale fell within normal bounds given the prior day’s redemption activity. Timechain Index tracks 16 entity categories, including centralized exchanges, miners, ETFs, publicly traded companies, custodians, governments, OTC desks, and payment processors. The platform aggregates known addresses for each cohort and monitors balance changes in real time. Sani’s “LiveChangesSummary” data showed Strategy’s 49,907 BTC outflow, Coinbase’s 11,762 BTC outflow, and ETC Group’s 6,973 BTC outflow as the largest movements, with smaller flows across custodians, exchanges, and miners. The distinction matters because Bitcoin’s on-chain transparency makes wallet movements visible before context arrives. When 87,464 BTC appears to leave institution-tracked addresses in a 24-hour window, the immediate read can suggest panic selling or a coordinated retreat from crypto exposure. The post-processing showed the opposite: net institutional holdings remained stable after accounting for internal transfers and standard ETF mechanics. Strategy’s custody diversification aligns with treasury management best practices for large holders. Concentrating nearly 650,000 BTC with a single custodian creates operational risk, and spreading holdings across multiple qualified custodians reduces exposure to any single point of failure. Bitcoin ETFs operate under different constraints. When investors redeem shares, authorized participants return creation units to the issuer and receive the underlying Bitcoin, which they then sell on the market to close out arbitrage positions. The Nov. 20 outflow figure of $903 million corresponded to roughly 10,400 BTC at prevailing prices, matching the ETF-cohort outflow Timechain Index recorded the following day. The lag reflects settlement timing rather than discretionary selling. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Posted on 11/25/2025 9:34:18 AM PST by DFG There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Interest rates should be higher. High rates lower inflation and promote savings. Low rates raise inflation and encourage borrow & spend. 2 posted on 11/25/2025 9:42:06 AM PST by Angelino97 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: DFG “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” I'm certainly no expert, but I see the entire global economic system as a complete house of cards. It's all debt. There is no way out. We just limp and limp and limp forward. It's going to come crashing down at some point. They will try to force us to a cashless CBDC system as a way to magically make debt go away, but I don't think that's going to work. It's all "gotten very complicated". 3 posted on 11/25/2025 9:47:11 AM PST by ClearCase_guy (Democrats seek power through cheating and assassination. They are sociopaths. They just want power.)

Title: Trump could make a decision on a new Fed chair 'before Christmas.' See who's on the short list

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas. "I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas," Bessent told CNBC in late November. "But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well." No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank. "I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people," Bessent said. Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement. Here are the five finalists. Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms. During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020. In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market." Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well. "I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting," Waller told Fox Business in late November. Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with "experience." It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank. "I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that," he said. Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him. Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's. In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times. In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years. Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were "the top three" to replace Powell. Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017. Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House. Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street. From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for "regime change" at the Fed. "The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them," Warsh told CNBC in July. "So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy." In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank. After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision. Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official. In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent. There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers. Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names. CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James "Jim" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention. Jump to

A Dublin-based Chinese businessman has been jailed for seven years and nine months over a money-laundering operation connected to an international €10 million “zombie” iPhone fraud. Chengwen Guo (43), who was described in court as the “Irish representative of a transnational crime organisation”, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to theft and money-laundering offences on dates between 2021 and 2022. Guo, of Ivy Exchange, Parnell Street, Dublin, owned a number of mobile phone shops called Murray Mobile, with eight stores in locations including Blackrock, Dundrum, Sutton Cross, Ranelagh and Newbridge. Guo has one previous conviction for having a false passport at Gatwick Airport in the UK, for which he received a custodial sentence of 13 months, the court was told. The court heard three sums of money seized in January 2022 included €6,515 found in an Audi Q7 car registered to Guo; €143,245 at his home address; and €20,700 at Murray Mobiles on Main Street in Dundrum, Dublin 14. Three Rolex watches were also found when gardaí searched his Parnell Street apartment in Dublin. His Audi has yet to be seized, the court heard. Judge Martin Nolan described Guo as “a very energetic man” who had engaged in “very substantial criminal misbehaviour”. “This man deserves a severe custodial sentence,” said Judge Nolan. The judge said it was “white-collar deviance”. The judge said “there was a gap there” and “the situation was found out”. The court was told the fake or “zombie” phones from China were exchanged under warranty for genuine iPhones which were then sent to countries outside of the EU for resale. The court heard 10,158 phones provided to Guo were last active mostly outside Ireland. The total retail value of the Apple products was €10,262,617. Det Sgt Robert Madden of the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau told the court that representatives from Apple Corporation were in court for the hearing. The scheme operated on the basis of the Apple warranty on its phones. The fraud involved sending in fake iPhones for repair and then claiming a replacement under Apple’s one-year warranty scheme. These fake phone components would come from China and would be assigned the EMEI number of a genuine iPhone when sent for repair. The replacement genuine iPhones would then be sent to Hong Kong for resale to countries outside the EU. The court heard Guo also sold counterfeit Apple products such as power chargers, charging cables and phone cases in his shops. In July 2021, counterfeit Apple goods, including 15 damaged iPhones and sim trays, were found after a package was sent to Ireland addressed to “Johnny Cheng” – which the court heard was a name the defendant used in Ireland for its simplicity rather than his Chinese name – at Murray Mobile in Main Street, Dundrum. Gardaí commenced an investigation and searches of all eight Murray Mobile shops took place on January 10th, 2022. Last month, Guo’s co-accused, who was an employee of Fonfix, a tech repair business in Sandyford, south Dublin, was jailed in the same court. Lukasz Lupa (45) of Kukukcza, Wagrowiec, Poland was given a 4½-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to two counts of facilitating a criminal organisation on dates between June 5th, 2019, and September 3rd, 2021, under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006. Lupa had claimed he did not know what he was doing was illegal and received little financial benefit for his part in the warranty fraud. Det Sgt Madden said Apple realised that the number of units Guo was sending in was unusually high. He told Eoin Lawlor SC, prosecuting, the phones would not power on and a diagnostic could not be performed on them. The phones were submitted without proof of purchase in the name of a company that runs a legitimate business and was not at fault, the court heard. Guo received brand new phones and was getting €30 to €40 per unit. Diana Stuart SC, defending, told the court in mitigation that Guo has four children. One is in boarding school in the UK and one is in boarding school in Ireland. He also has a child in university in Edinburgh. His wife’s day-to-day living expenses amount to €1,000 a week, Ms Stuart told the court. Judge Nolan said the appropriate global sentence was one of seven years and nine months.

Title: Mother killed in attack near her Cork home had ‘inbuilt generosity’, funeral told

Mother of four Stella Gallagher had an “inbuilt generosity” and was always giving of herself and helping others, mourners at her funeral mass have heard. Her brother-in-law, Alan Gallagher, spoke with emotion as he delivered a eulogy to mourners, led by Ms Gallagher’s husband, Brian, and their daughter and sons, Ciara, Conor and Mark, at her funeral mass in Cork city on Tuesday. Ms Gallagher (59) was fatally injured and her 63-year-old husband suffered serious injuries when they were attacked near their home at Shrewsbury Downs in Ballinlough, Cork, on November 17th. Alan Gallagher told mourners at a packed Our Lady of Lourdes Church how he had asked his brother, niece and nephews what memories they had of Ms Gallagher and they said: “Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family.” He said: “Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them, whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip. “She had an inbuilt generosity and was always doing things for others or giving them things. If you mentioned in passing you liked something, the next time you saw her she’d have bought them for you or baked them for you or whatever. “It was the same when Stella was cooking food. When cooking for two people, she cooked enough for six. If you mentioned you had to go into town later, she’d get her car keys and offer to drop you in.” Mr Gallagher recalled the great pleasure and joy his sister-in-law derived from her involvement with the Togher Community Garden and the Cork Health Education Project Choir, based in nearby Blackrock, with whom she sang. “Stella was an excellent baker, and got pleasure from giving you scones or sourdough bread or apple tarts and she’d come in after losing track of time in her garden, delighted to be able to present you with her harvest of blackcurrants or potatoes or beetroot or whatever was in season. “Stella seemed to know the name of every flower and every tree, and on a recent visit to JFK Arboretum in Wexford she was like a child in a sweet shop. “We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will.” Celebrant Msgr Gearóid Dullea told mourners when people were confronted with death they experienced a maelstrom of emotions, and he said the shock and sadness over Ms Gallagher’s death spread far beyond her family and the community in Ballinlough. “Stella’s shocking death has brought a great pall of darkness, not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families, but also on so many others – Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle and over many friends.” Taoiseach Michéal Martin, who lives nearby in Ballinlough and spoke last week of how devastated the Gallagher family must be, was represented at the funeral his Aide de Camp, Comdt Joe Glennon. Ms Gallagher’s eldest son, David Gallagher (25), of Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, is due to reappear at Cork District Court on Wednesday. He was charged last week with his mother’s murder and with assault causing harm to his father, Brian Gallagher, at Shrewsbury Downs on November 17th.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. But White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is reportedly seen by advisers and allies of Trump as the frontrunner, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email.

Never miss a story. “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” Hassett appears to agree with Trump’s view of the economy, including that interest rates need to come down. He told Fox News during an interview on Nov. 20 that he would “be cutting rates right now” if he were the Fed chairman because “the data suggests that we should.” Hassett has also criticized central bankers for losing control of inflation. Follow The Post’s live coverage of President Trump and national politics for the latest news and analysis Fed officials, meanwhile, have been split on whether to cut interest rates further after two consecutive quarter-point cuts at the September and October meetings, down to the 3.75% to 4% range. Markets rebounded after New York Fed President John Williams said Friday there is room for “further adjustment in the near term” to interest rates. Traders are currently betting on 83% odds of a quarter-point cut at the Dec. 10 meeting, according to CME FedWatch. But Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan on Friday called for holding rates “for a time,” and Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she was “hesitant” about the next policy move since “restrictive policy is very appropriate right now.” Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said she’s approaching the December meeting “cautiously.” But Fed Governor Stephen Miran has said he would vote for a quarter-point cut if that meant the difference in getting lower rates. He has previously dissented in favor of a larger cut. Meanwhile, Bessent said he is hoping for the next chairman to bring the role into a new era. “I think we’ve got to kind of simplify things,” he said Tuesday. “I think it’s time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people.” Advertisement

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Ondo Finance Puts $25M Into YLDS Tokenized Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-ondo-finance-makes-25m-tokenized-fund/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:50:53Z

Quick Facts: Ondo Finance just injected $25M into YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund. YLDS will join an exclusivist portfolio which also includes assets from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton. It’s a textbook signal that serious capital is leaning further into tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and crypto-backed lending as a core part of modern market infrastructure. The winners are likely to be the tools and tokens that sit directly on those flows. So, as interest for RWAs grows, the best crypto to buy next focuses less on hype and more on who is building the plumbing. With that lens, three projects stand out in the current market: Best Wallet Token ($BEST) as a next-gen wallet layer onboarding everyday users, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) as an AI-plus-Web3 content economy play, and XRP ($XRP) as the institutional cross-border backbone to fuel efficient crypto transfers. As tokenized treasuries, yield-bearing stablecoins, and onchain credit markets expand, the bottleneck is no longer just liquidity – it’s UX and security. Best Wallet steps in to solve this issue with a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. The $BEST token provides in-app utility for holders using this wallet layer. For example, $BEST unlocks first-stage presale access in the Upcoming Tokens portal. Here, early buyers can check vetted presales with a simplified purchase flow, effectively turning the wallet into a vetted deal-launchpad for emerging opportunities. Economically, the presale has already raised over $17.4M with $BEST sitting at $0.025995, signaling meaningful traction at seed-stage valuations. Based on Best Wallet’s value proposition, our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at $0.072 by the end of 2025. That makes up for a 175% ROI potential for EOY investment. In a favorable market context, the numbers can go higher, especially if Best Wallet sees mainstream adoption. Note that the presale only has three days left, so slots are running out. Buy $BEST today before the presale ends. While DeFi chases yields, the $85B content-creation industry is quietly shifting toward models where creators actually own their output and audience data. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) targets that gap by merging Web3 payments with AI-native tools, giving creators both lower platform fees and more control over monetization. The presale has already raised over $1.3M+ at a token price of $0.057025, suggesting early conviction in the thesis that creators will follow better economics. Given that the project is planning to onboard the top 2,000+ highest-earning creators, we expect SUBBD to see massive post-launch adoption. From a growth-sector perspective, SUBBD is a leveraged bet on AI + creator monetization rather than just number-go-up memetics. As onchain finance broadens, attention remains the most scarce resource – SUBBD is building rails to tokenize it. Buy $SUBBD from the official presale today. On the institutional side of this market shift, XRP ($XRP) sits in a privileged position. XRP is designed specifically for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and liquidity provisioning for financial institutions, settling transactions on the XRP Ledger in around 3-5 seconds with minimal fees suitable for high-volume flows. $XRP is also a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap and a leading asset in the blockchain-based payments sector, making it a more mature, lower-volatility way to express a view on the continued growth of onchain settlement rails. The project’s profile lines up directly with the kind of tokenized treasuries and yield-bearing stablecoin activity Ondo’s move highlights. As more traditional finance players look for instant, global settlement of tokenized assets, they need enterprise-grade infrastructure, which Ripple has spent years building – from compliance tooling to bank integrations and payment corridors. In November 2025, Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation to expand institutional XRP use and deepen its footprint in payments. Find $XRP on Binance today. This is not financial advice.

Title: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/standard-chartered-21shares-crypto-custody-shift
Time Published: 2025-11-25T14:37:56Z

Standard Chartered will provide digital asset custody for 21Shares, signaling deeper expansion into crypto by traditional financial players. Update (Nov. 26, 2025, at 8:30 am UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares and Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody. Major bank Standard Chartered announced fund manager 21Shares has selected it as its digital asset custodian, potentially moving away from a crypto-native partner. According to a Monday announcement from Standard Chartered shared with Cointelegraph, the bank will provide crypto custody services to 21Shares, which offers multiple exchange-traded crypto products. Margaret Harwood-Jones, the bank’s global head of financing and securities services, said the collaboration allows them to “to extend our expertise into the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem.” However, 21Shares already had a crypto-native custody partner. In late June 2024, the fund manager partnered with crypto-native custodian Zodia Custody to hold its assets. Zodia Custody was co-founded by Standard Chartered in 2020 and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary, indicating that the bank wanted to avoid direct involvement in crypto at the time. Julian Sawyer, CEO of Zodia Custody, said that the company views Standard Chartered’s appointment “as a positive sign of the industry’s continued maturity.” He also explained that “Standard Chartered’s custody offering employs Zodia Custody’s underlying technology and risk frameworks.” The move comes as more traditional financial institutions roll out crypto services, often with reputational advantages over crypto-native competitors. Still, Alistair Byas-Perry, head of EU investments and capital markets at 21Shares, told Cointelegraph that this is not a shift from existing partners. Instead, “adding Standard Chartered simply expands our multi-custodian model.” He said: Byas-Perry also said that “21Shares continues to work with leading crypto-native custodians.” He explained that the fund manager chose Standard Chartered “because of their global reputation, regulatory footprint, and risk-management standards” and added: Byas-Perry explained that “some institutions prefer working with names they already know, while others rely on crypto-native specialists.” Still, he believes that 21Shares’ “job is to support both.” Standard Chartered had not answered Cointelegraph’s request for comment by publication. Related: BlackRock quietly accumulated 3% of all Bitcoin. Here’s what that means Standard Chartered said 21Shares will work with its newly established digital asset custody service based in Luxembourg. The announcement follows the bank’s mid-July launch of a trading service that allows institutions and corporations to trade major cryptocurrencies. 21Shares’ global head of product development, Mandy Chiu, said the collaboration is “an important milestone in our continued mission to bring institutional-grade infrastructure to the digital asset ecosystem.” She pointed to the bank’s reputation in traditional finance as an advantage. Other major banks have taken similar steps. In September, US multinational financial services firm US Bancorp reentered the crypto space by relaunching its digital asset custody services aimed explicitly at investment managers. This follows the company’s launch of its custody service in 2021, which was subsequently shut down due to unfavorable regulations. Mid-August reports also note that Wall Street giant Citigroup is weighing plans to offer cryptocurrency custody and payment services. In July, Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, was also reported to be planning to allow its clients to store cryptocurrencies — amid a broader trend in the nation. Related: US Federal agencies outline key risks for banks eyeing crypto custody That trend has stirred debate within the industry, as crypto-native institutions face intense competition. In October, Martin Hiesboeck, head of blockchain and crypto research at crypto financial services platform Uphold, said that large Bitcoin (BTC) wallets moving their assets into ETFs is “another nail in the coffin of the original crypto spirit.” The comment follows Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, saying that the company had already facilitated more than $3 billion worth of real Bitcoin to ETF conversions. He added that holders recognize “the convenience of being able to hold their exposure within their existing financial adviser or private-bank relationship.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: BlackRock’s $400 Million Bitcoin Move Sparks Liquidity Alarm | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee as markets enter an unusual phase where large players are repositioning and liquidity is tightening. Against this backdrop, the timing of one major transfer has raised fresh questions about what might be coming next for Bitcoin. BlackRock quietly moved 4,471 BTC to Coinbase Prime, hours before the PPI report. The move comes as its flagship Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, logged record monthly outflows. BlackRock just deposited another 4,471 $BTC($390.8M) to #CoinbasePrime.https://t.co/qmuDIrPHc6 pic.twitter.com/3CqgyHozVC The timing has ignited a new debate: Is the world’s biggest asset manager preparing for a deeper US liquidity shock? Arkham data shows the same wallet has fallen from a $117 billion peak to $78.4 billion, losing more than 30% of its value over the past month. The transfer occurs at a time of increasing stress across Bitcoin markets, with analysts like Crypto Rover noting that BlackRock’s move could exacerbate selling. Meanwhile, the timing ahead of the US PPI has also raised concern. Meanwhile,VanEck’s Matthew Sigel sees the Bitcoin price’s ongoing struggle as primarily a macro dynamic, calling it an “overwhelmingly a US-session phenomenon. “…The driver: tightening US liquidity and widening credit spreads as AI-capex fears collided with a more fragile funding market,” he stated. This aligns with recent stress across equities, credit, and rate-sensitive assets. Traders are watching whether the November PPI print, due just after the BTC transfer, signals further tightening. However, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood argues the current liquidity pressure is temporary. “The liquidity squeeze that has hit AI and crypto will reverse in the next few weeks,” she said. The Ark Invest executive cited a 123% surge in Palantir’s US commercial business, calling it evidence that enterprise adoption is accelerating despite macro headwinds. The blockchain activity comes as BlackRock’s IBIT posts its worst outflow month on record, over $2 billion this month. Analysts highlight it as the biggest withdrawal wave since launch. “…After months of steady inflows, the outflows reflect rising caution as Bitcoin falls ~22% over the past month and 7% year-to-date,” wrote Walter Bloomberg. However, ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pushed back on the panic, stressing that context is being lost. According to the analyst, the majority of investors are sticking around despite the outflows. That’s bc it never had outflows bf! All told the “record” is 3% of aum. The real story (that you def won’t see in ALL CAPS let alone in the media at large) is 97% of investors are sticking around despite not starting the -35% fire. https://t.co/2p0c5gJIji He also highlighted the collapse in short interest, ascribing plummeting IBIT short interest to traders who tend to short into strength and cover in downturns. In other words, despite headlines screaming about “record outflows,” the majority of institutional holders appear to be staying put. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Flow Data.

Title: Private Assets to Be Half of Industry Revenues by 2030, PwC Says

The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, PwC found. November 25, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Private markets will generate more than half of the money-management industry’s revenues by 2030, an increase that reflects the intensifying competition among firms to expand in private debt and equity and infrastructure, according to PwC. “The winners won’t be those who gather the most assets, but those who rewire the fastest,” Albertha Charles, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC UK, said Monday in a report that surveyed 300 global firms and investors. The asset- and wealth-management industry will take in about $432 billion in revenue from private assets in 2030, exceeding the totals for traditional actively managed investments and for passive products, the consultancy found. In 2024, private assets accounted for 44% of total revenue, with traditional investments making up most of the industry total, according to PwC. Still, private markets have become increasingly crowded. Many traditional fund houses — including Franklin Resources Inc., Invesco Ltd. and State Street Corp. — have acquired or partnered with private-markets firms recently to gain a foothold. BlackRock Inc. has spent more than $25 billion since the start of 2024 to grow in private credit and infrastructure and compete with the likes of Blackstone Inc., Apollo Global Management Inc. and Ares Management Corp. Related:Rowan Says People ‘Lost Their Minds’ Over Private Credit Fears The asset management industry is also facing unrelenting fee pressure on traditional stock, bond, money-market and multi-asset funds, with almost 60% of institutional investors surveyed by PwC saying they’re likely or very likely to replace a manager solely for cost reasons. As a result, fees are expected to decline across active and passive strategies, even while costs remain stubbornly high. “Traditional cost-cutting has barely made a dent,” PwC said. “Diversifying into new asset classes and expanding into new markets add cost and complexity.” Fast forward five years, though, and technology will help drive profits in an industry with ever-narrowing margins, according to PwC. “Asset managers see AI integration and automation as the most important actions they’re taking today to transform and future-proof their business models for 2030,” the firm said in the report.

It examines the forecasted size of the AI market, delving into specific types of AI spend (such as generative AI, computer vision, and agentic AI). The report lists different ways of utilizing AI to combat fraud, cyberattacks, evolving regulation, bad user experience, growing volumes of transactional data, and new attack vectors. It provides new case studies of innovative uses of AI within the industry, while providing company profiles of the leading AI adopters and specialist vendors across the insurance, banking, payments, and wealth management industries.AI adoption in financial services has ramped up significantly in the last few years. Financial services firms have long adopted generative AI tools for customer service and improved decision making, yet sustained direct profitability remains far off. The recent boom of agentic AI investment has necessitated financial services companies to reconsider all of their AI pilots, to govern deployments like product launches: require return on investment gates, scale what demonstrably pays, and sunset what does not. Financial services firms must adopt AI to improve cybersecurity and fraud prevention in the face of adaptive cyberattacks, new attack vectors, and rising insider threats.Report Scope Reasons to Buy Key Topics Covered: 1.

Title: 'Shocked, stunned' - locals gather for Gallagher funeral

Time Published: 2025-11-25T13:19:18Z

The funeral mass of a 59-year-old woman who died after an attack near her home in Ballinlough in Cork city earlier this month has heard that she brought "goodness and beauty to this world". Family, friends and members of the local community gathered at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Ballinlough today for the funeral mass of Stella Gallagher. Her husband Brian Gallagher, who was also injured in the attack, was at the mass along with the couple's adult children Ciara, Conor and Mark. Brian Gallagher was among the pallbearers who carried the coffin out of the church at the conclusion of the service for burial at St Michael's cemetery in nearby Blackrock. Alan Gallagher, a brother-in-law of Stella Gallagher, said a few words on behalf of his brother Brian during the requiem mass. Mr Gallagher said Stella had 30 wonderful years of life with her family. "When I asked them what some of their good memories of Stella were, they looked back at me and said they were all good. She was a joy to be around and great fun. She was game for anything and would go anywhere and have a good time." Mr Gallagher emphasised that Stella loved meeting people and chatting with them. "Whether her many relatives, cousins and second cousins, or someone she had just met. She loved going on outings with people, whether for a hike in the country or to a film or on a shopping trip." Mr Gallagher also recalled the activities that made Stella "really light up with joy" including singing, gardening and baking. "We are so grateful to have shared our lives with this lovely person. We love you, Stella, and we always will." Mr Gallagher closed his eulogy with a few lines by American short story writer Raymond Carver. "And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the Earth." Meanwhile, Monsignor Gearóid Dullea, co-parish priest in Ballinlough, told mourners that the death of Stella had left her loved ones "broken hearted" and "bewildered". He stated that her "shocking death" had brought a "great pall of sadness" not only over the Gallagher and Griffin families but also on the wider community. "Stella’s colleagues from her work in Eli Lilly, the local communities in Ballinlough and Ballinspittle, her friends and the Togher Community Garden and her fellow singers in the SHEP choir. Stella’s death has shocked us, stunned us and shaken us. "Stella was deeply loved as wife, as mother, as sister, as daughter-in-law, as sister-in-law, as aunt, as cousin, as friend. She was a positive person, often humming a song, with a quiet religious faith," he said. Offertory gifts included apples representing Stella’s love of gardening, sourdough signifying her enjoyment of baking, sheet music arising of her fondness for music and a gift box symbolising her generous and giving nature. Monsignor Dullea celebrated the mass alongside Fr Gerard Dunne and Rev Alan Marley, both of whom were representing University College Cork. Taoiseach Micheál Martin was represented by his Aide de Camp, Commandant Joe Glennon. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Crypto ETF flows: BTC sees $151M outflows as ETH and SOL funds thrive

The cryptocurrency sector remains weak as bearish sentiments prevail. Indeed, recent price drops, muted trading activities, and worries about short-term recoveries have seen many investors adopt a defensive bias. Exchange-traded funds flow data reflects this uncertainty, with Bitcoin recording massive withdrawals as altcoin products hold steady. Let us find out more. BTC spot ETFs had a rough session on Monday, with net outflows totaling $151 million, according to SoSoValue. That signals deteriorated interest in these financial products, which have played a key role in institutional crypto adoption. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC stood out as it posted positive ETF flows of $15.49 million on Monday amidst the broader retreat. On the other hand, BlackRock has struggled lately, with iShares’ outflows surpassing $2.2 billion so far in November. Meanwhile, the mixed ETF outflows come as the Bitcoin price experiences notable downward pressure. The bellwether crypto is trading at $88,190, down from late last month’s high above $115,500. While investors remain more conservative about Bitcoin, Ethereum thrived. Data shows Ether ETFs attracted $96.67 million in inflows yesterday, with BlackRock’s ETHA dominating at $92.61 million. Ethereum seems to thrive as Bitcoin struggles, as narratives like the latest attacks on Strategy by JPMorgan magnified uncertainty in BTC-based financial products. Institutions are seemingly migrating to Ethereum, possibly indicating renewed trust in its unique role in powering scaling solutions, decentralized apps (dApps), and support for new infrastructure. ETH is changing hands at $2,925 after gaining 3% the past 24 hours. It lost more than 2% the past week. Solana held its ground, attracting net inflows of $57.99 million on November 24. The altcoin has seen positive ETF flows since its debut, highlighting steady institutional demand. For instance, Bitwise’s Solana spot exchange-traded fund surpassed $500 million AUM last week. Solana experienced amplified institutional interest due to its robust network that prioritizes scalability, speed, and security. The team spent the past years rewriting Solana’s reputation, darkened by previous network outages. Now, the blockchain exhibits a thriving developer community, booming app usage, and Solana-based tokens. With these factors, Solana has carved a unique lane in the blockchain industry. SOL is trading at $138 after soaring 5% in the last 24 hours. The altcoin lost nearly 30% of its value over the past month. Meanwhile, Solana inflow confirms investors looking beyond price performance while prioritizing long-term potential. Meanwhile, the latest ETF flow statistics highlight a split market. Investors are now exploring crypto offerings beyond Bitcoin. Institutional investors are no longer treating all cryptocurrencies the same. They’re now evaluating every project based on solid catalysts, narratives, and momentum.

Title: What happened to crypto market today – Mild recovery, but where is smart money?

Rebound on bid support, smart money still on the sidelines. Despite a mild rebound, extreme fear shows that broader capital hasn’t entered the crypto market today, keeping smart money cautious. Bullish signs like rising whale holdings and institutional interest in DOGE/XRP ETFs indicate the market still has upside potential. The crypto market today registered a mild rebound. Bitcoin [BTC] retested $88,000, sparking debate over whether it has bottomed or if selling pressure is still weighing on the market. Ethereum [ETH] followed, climbing back above $2,800. All in all, has the market turned bullish? On the macro side, nearly $50 billion flowed into the crypto market over the last 24 hours. Notably, $30 billion of that went straight into Bitcoin. That’s 60% of inflows, a sign that traders are still favoring BTC over altcoins, keeping this cycle BTC-led. The result? The Altcoin Season Index slipped by 3 points to 39. In short, the minor rebound of the crypto market today isn’t broad-based. The inflows seemed to be too concentrated, making it premature to call a market bottom yet, with the TOTAL index already down 0.38% intraday. Source: TradingView (TOTAL/USDT) Simply put, the overall market participation has been cautious. BlackRock, for example, has been selling aggressively, moving 2,822 BTC and 36k ETH into Coinbase Prime. On the ETF side, inflows for both BTC and ETH have been flat, showing that big money isn’t jumping in yet. Reinforcing this, the Fear and Greed Index ticked up just 2 points to 12. However, it’s still in “extreme” fear, matching market positioning, with 95% of 24-hour liquidations in the crypto market today coming from longs. Despite bearish signals though, the crypto market today did see some signs of optimism. On the institutional front, Grayscale’s Dogecoin [DOGE] and Ripple [XRP] ETFs grabbed attention, reinforcing confidence in digital assets. Backing this trend, a prominent analyst challenged the idea of a market top. For one, 560k BTC flowed off CEXs, pushing reserves to an eight-year low. Meanwhile, whales holding over 10k BTC hit a five-month high – A sign that even in a risk-off environment, buying pressure didn’t quite disappear. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In short, the crypto market today jumped on bid support. Alas, with institutional catalysts still missing, inflows concentrated in BTC, fear at extreme levels, and the Altcoin Season Index slipping, broader capital hasn’t entered yet. This is keeping smart money on the sidelines for now. So, while the crypto market today sparked some hope, it’s too early to call a bottom. The bright side – Bullish signals may be still intact, driving the rebound, with a market top nowhere in sight.

Title: Ondo turns to Figure’s stablecoin with $25M investment to back tokenized fund

The investment broadens Ondo Finance’s onchain Treasury reserves and comes amid a renewed push into crypto-backed lending across fintechs, lenders and exchanges. Ondo Finance bought $25 million worth of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions, to diversify the assets backing its tokenized US Treasurys fund. The company said Monday that YLDS will be added to a reserves portfolio that already includes tokenized Treasury products from major asset managers, including funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Designed for institutional investors, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) offers onchain exposure to Treasurys with 24/7 redemptions and an estimated annual return of 3.68%. The tokenized fund had about $777 million in total value locked (TVL) as of this writing. Figure runs lending and capital-markets infrastructure on the Provenance blockchain, and has originated more than $19 billion in loans across home-equity lines, mortgage products, and crypto-backed credit. The deal follows Figure’s completion of its Nasdaq IPO earlier this year. According to DefiLlama data, its YLDS stablecoin has a market capitalization of around $100 million. Ondo Finance is a US-based platform founded in 2021 that tokenizes traditional financial assets. In October, the company expanded its tokenized asset lineup to BNB Chain, adding more than 100 tokenized Wall Street stocks and exchange-traded funds onchain. On Wednesday, the platform received regulatory approval from the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) to offer tokenized stocks in Europe. Figure’s stock price was up nearly 4% in early trading on Monday, according to Yahoo Finance data. Related: Ondo Finance to SEC: Hold off on Nasdaq’s tokenized securities plan Crypto-backed lending is gaining traction globally, and the trend has accelerated in 2025 as more lenders revive and expand crypto-collateralized loan products. In July, Block Earner introduced Bitcoin-backed home loans in Australia, offering borrowers cash worth up to half a property’s value, with the crypto collateral safeguarded by Fireblocks. On Tuesday, stablecoin issuer Tether announced an investment in Ledn, a platform that provides Bitcoin-backed consumer loans. In the third quarter, Ledn reported originating over $390 million in BTC-backed loans. Centralized exchanges are also expanding into this space and broadening their offerings beyond Bitcoin (BTC). On Thursday, Coinbase rolled out Ether-backed loans for US customers, letting users borrow up to $1 million in USDC against their Ether (ETH) holdings. Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have handled about $1.28 billion in loan originations since launching earlier this year, according to Dune data.
