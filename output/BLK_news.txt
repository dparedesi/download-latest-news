Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Highlights Threats From BlackRock’s Institutional Influence

At the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns about the increasing dominance of institutional giants like BlackRock over cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH. He emphasized that this growing influence could potentially lead to significant challenges for the decentralized nature of these networks. Buterin was prompted to address this issue during a discussion on the implications of institutional interest, especially following BlackRock’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. He questioned how the cryptocurrency community could safeguard against being “captured” by large entities such as BlackRock, highlighting a pressing concern about the future of decentralization in the space. Buterin also expressed apprehension that if institutional players continue to expand their Ethereum holdings, those who prioritize decentralization might find themselves marginalized. This situation could result in fundamental changes to the Ethereum network, optimizing it for institutional needs and making it increasingly difficult for everyday users to operate nodes. Buterin warned, “It easily drives other people away,” further stating the necessity of concentrating on attributes that would typically be scarce, such as creating a global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol. This week, BlackRock made headlines by registering a staked Ethereum fund in Delaware, indicating its intention to enter the staked Ethereum ETF market. Their flagship Ethereum ETF currently manages approximately $10 billion worth of ETH tokens. In addition to the concerns surrounding institutional involvement, the specter of quantum computing looms large over the future of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recently, Google announced a breakthrough in quantum computing capabilities, following similar advancements at Microsoft, which unveiled a new quantum-enabling chip earlier this year. Quantum researcher Scott Aaronson noted the alarming potential for quantum computers to execute Shor’s algorithm, which could compromise the encryption standards securing Bitcoin and Ethereum. He suggested that the current pace of hardware innovation might lead to the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer before the next US presidential election, escalating the urgency around potential vulnerabilities in blockchain technology. “We don’t need to panic, but we need to get serious,” asserted Alex Pruden, CEO of quantum computing risk company Project 11. He cautioned that sufficiently advanced quantum computers could break cryptocurrencies at their most fundamental level. As the discussion shifts toward the need for proactive measures, Bitcoin developers have also been urged to prepare for a post-quantum future, which some experts predict could materialize as early as 2030. Théau Peronnin, CEO of Alice & Bob, advised during the Web Summit conference in Lisbon that developers should consider transitioning to a stronger blockchain by 2030 to safeguard against potential quantum threats. “You should have a few good years ahead of you, but I wouldn’t hold my Bitcoin,” he warned, emphasizing the importance of addressing these challenges head-on.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B

Time Published: 2025-11-21T09:05:15Z

BlackRock’s IBIT drives November’s record ETF outflows, bleeding $2.47 billion and accounting for 63% of the $3.79 billion withdrawn from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw another sharp reversal on Thursday, erasing a brief moment of relief earlier in the week. After breaking a five-day outflow streak with $75.4 million in inflows on Wednesday, the funds were hit with fresh redemptions of $903 million Thursday — the biggest outflow day in November and one of the largest single-day outflows since the products were launched in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. The $3.79 billion withdrawal puts November on track to be the worst month on record for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF outflows if the remaining days fail to offset this month’s redemptions. The figure has already surpassed February’s $3.56 billion, which held the record for the largest monthly outflow since the ETFs debuted. Investment giant BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF is the largest driver of the historic November outflows. The product has seen $2.47 billion in net redemptions so far this month, accounting for roughly 63% of the total $3.79 billion withdrawn from all US spot BTC ETFs. The fund also led this week’s outflows with $1.02 billion. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of analytics platform CryptoQuant, flagged this week’s performance as IBIT’s “largest weekly outflow ever.” Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed as the second-largest outflow driver in November with monthly outflows of $1.09 billion. Just this week, the issuer has seen $225.9 million withdrawn so far, reflecting moderate but persistent redemptions. While FBTC’s outflows remain smaller than IBIT’s, both funds contributed to the broader liquidity drain that pushed November past February’s record for the heaviest month of Bitcoin ETF outflows. Together, they account for 91% of total US spot BTC ETF outflows in November. Related: Bitcoin won’t hit $200K until Q3 2029: Veteran trader Peter Brandt According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin fell to $83,461 on Friday, following the nearly $1 billion in ETF outflows. The drop pushed BTC to its lowest level in seven months, a price zone last seen in April. Industry voices say the downturn may only be the start. Alliance DAO co-founder QwQiao reposted his warning in September, arguing that the next bear market may be harsher than expected. “There’s a large cohort of dumb money who know nothing about crypto buying DATs and ETFs. This never ends well,” he wrote, adding that markets may need to endure another “50% drawdown” before a durable foundation can be formed. Chris Burniske, the co-founder of crypto venture firm Placeholder, said that the era of DAT selling has only begun,” cautioning that just as ETFs and digital asset treasuries (DATs) amplified Bitcoin’s ascent, they could equally intensify the move downward. DefiLlama data shows that DAT inflows dropped to $1.93 billion in October, an 82% decrease from September’s $10.89 billion. Data showed that inflows significantly decreased after about $20 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in October. At the time of writing, DAT inflows have only reached $505 million. At this rate, November is on track to become the lowest month for DAT inflows in 2025.

Title: HelloTrade, Founded by Former BlackRock Crypto Leaders, Announces Fundraise to Unlock Global, Frictionless Access to Global Equities

November 21, 2025 03:00 ET | Source: HelloTrade HelloTrade New York, NY,, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HelloTrade, a new blockchain-powered trading platform founded by former BlackRock crypto directors Wyatt Raich and Kevin Tang, announced that it has closed a $4.6M seed round led by Dragonfly Capital. The round came together in under a week, reflecting strong conviction in the size of the market opportunity and the team’s track record building category-defining products. At BlackRock, Kevin and Wyatt launched the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the fastest ETF in history to reach $100B in assets. For decades, access to the world’s capital markets and leveraged equity trading has been constrained by geography, high capital requirements, complex derivatives, and legacy brokerage systems. These barriers have made obtaining directional exposure and leverage to global equities challenging for retail and professional investors. HelloTrade aims to change that. Built on MegaETH, the platform will let users everywhere gain leveraged exposure to stocks, ETFs, commodities, and crypto. The app is designed for everyday investors with a mobile first experience, removing the usual points of friction that come with crypto trading. There is no wallet setup, no gas payments, and no technical jargon. Users simply open the app and trade with the speed of a traditional brokerage platform, enabled by MegaETH’s ability to process more than one hundred thousand transactions per second. “Trading stocks with leverage shouldn’t be gated by geography or account minimums,” said co-founder Kevin Tang. “We’ve now seen how crypto derivatives transformed access to digital assets. HelloTrade applies that same ethos to traditional equities, making it possible for investors around the world to participate in the world’s most dynamic markets”. The company is supported by a strong group of advisors, including Arthur Hayes (Maelstrom), Josh Lim (FalconX), David C. (LeadBlock Partners & LeadBlock Bitpanda Ventures), Larry Florio (Ethena), and Andrew Saunders (Amazon). “While leading the engineering team for BlackRock’s Digital Assets Lab, I had the privilege of building IBIT, ETHA, and BUIDL, some of the largest cryptoasset products in the world. That experience highlighted a tremendous opportunity to bring the same trust, discipline, and institutional standards we upheld at BlackRock to the rest of the world and build something truly transformative with HelloTrade,” said co-founder Wyatt Raich, and prior head of digital assets engineering at BlackRock. About HelloTradeKevin and Wyatt first crossed paths at BlackRock as foundational team members in the firm’s digital assets division. Despite their different backgrounds-Kevin as a financial services veteran with over 12-years experience, and Wyatt coming from a career in AI and robotics at Lockheed Martin-the two shared a conviction that blockchain technology could transform capital markets and investing. HelloTrade is expected to launch in the form of a mobile app across both iOS and Android. For early access, a waitlist is currently live at hello.trade.Disclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Title: Dollar hedging frenzy fades, bringing relief to greenback

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar notes are seen in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Refiles to add ANALYSIS tag back, no changes to text) By Alun John and Naomi Rovnick LONDON :Just months after a U.S. tariff shock whacked the dollar, a rush by overseas investors to protect U.S. holdings from the sliding currency has slowed sharply - a vote of confidence that's helping the greenback recover from its worst rout in years. While analysts say investor hedging is higher than it has been historically, such activity has slowed from the period immediately after the April 2 "Liberation Day", when U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs.

Loading At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar. Nimble investors moved to hedge against a further dollar decline and the trend was expected to gain momentum. Instead, it has slowed, allowing the U.S. currency to stabilise."The conversations we're having with clients now suggest that these (hedging) flows are less likely to come as imminently as the conversations we had back in May suggested they would," said David Leigh, Nomura's global head of FX and emerging markets. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against other major currencies, has rallied nearly 4 per cent since the end of June, when it was nursing losses of almost 11 per cent after its biggest first-half dive since the early 1970s. Data on hedging is limited and analysts extrapolate from scarce public figures and numbers compiled by banks and custodians. Analysis of client positioning by BNY, one of the world's largest custodians, shows they were very long U.S. assets in early 2025, suggesting they didn't anticipate much additional dollar weakness and were happy to operate without much hedging.That changed in April and hedging is now higher than normal, although lower than in late 2023 when markets began to anticipate Federal Reserve rate cuts."The dollar diversification story this year is more talked about than actioned upon," said Geoff Yu, BNY's senior market strategist. Other giant custodians reported a similar picture. State Street Markets' analysis of the assets State Street has under custody and administration showed that as of end October, foreign equity managers’ hedging of their dollar holdings was 24 per cent, a 4 per centage-point increase since February, but well below the 30 per cent-plus hedge ratio they have seen in the past. They too said it had slowed in recent weeks. It varies by market too. A November National Australia Bank survey of Australian pension funds found "no material change in hedging behaviour towards U.S. equities". Danish central bank data, however, shows hedging by pension funds there has stabilised after increasing post-April. Columbia Threadneedle CIO William Davies said that the firm initially moved to protect its U.S. stock holdings against further dollar weakness but has since unwound some of its hedges, betting the currency won't decline further. NO SNOWBALL EFFECTHedging itself causes currencies to move - adding protection against dollar downside to a previously unhedged position effectively involves selling the greenback, and vice versa. If combined with shifting interest rates, the effect can be dramatic - a dollar selloff can spark more hedging, sending it lower still. "People, earlier this year, were getting excited that this snowball effect would develop, though in the end it didn't really," said HSBC's Paul Mackel, global head of FX research. For next year, "it's something to keep an eye on, but it's not our baseline scenario". Still investor behaviour may be shifting. BlackRock estimates that 38 per cent of flows into Europe, Middle East and Africa-listed U.S. equity exchange-traded products this year have been into those with FX hedges, a meaningful change from 2024 when 98 per cent of flows were unhedged. COST, CORRELATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS Cost is also a factor, and depends on rate differentials and so varies by market. This may help explain some of the reluctance to hedge positions.Japanese investors pay around an annualised 3.7 per cent to hedge against dollar weakness, estimates Van Luu, Russell Investments' global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and FX. This is a sizeable sum - if dollar/yen holds steady for a year, an investor is down 3.7 per cent versus an unhedged peer. The equivalent cost for a euro-funded investor is around 2 per cent."I have a rule of thumb for euro investors, if the cost is around 1 per cent they don't care much, but if it's 2 per cent then it becomes a factor," Luu said. Asset correlations matter too. Traditionally the dollar strengthens when stocks fall, meaning overseas investors are effectively protected on their U.S. positions. That did not happen in April, contributing to the hedging rush. This month, the dollar held steady as stocks tumbled again.Change is also complicated for the many investors who aim to outperform a fixed benchmark if that benchmark is unhedged. Fidelity International recommends Europe-based investors move gradually towards hedging 50 per cent of their dollar exposure, but Salman Ahmed, head of macro and strategic asset allocation, notes it is a "very involved" process which can require governance and benchmark changes.If interest rates move against the dollar and it starts to weaken again, and hedges become cheaper, pressure for change may build. "There's still lots of scope for dollar investments to be hedged, whether that comes to pass and how quickly is an open question," said Nomura's Leigh. "That's what the FX market's trying to get its head around." At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar.

Title: BitMine’s Unrealized Losses Hit $3.7B As Ethereum (ETH) Price Struggles Below $3,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A recent report discussed how Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like BitMine and Strategy are sitting on billions of dollars of unrealized profits as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) lose crucial support levels. On Thursday, crypto insights company 10x Research reported that the largest Ethereum Treasury company, BitMine Immersion Technologies, has a multi-billion-dollar paper loss after the ongoing market correction, which has sent ETH to multi-month lows. “Bitmine is now down more than $1,000 per ETH, implying about $3.7 billion in unrealized losses before even accounting for the hefty NAV [net asset value] premium public-market investors paid on top,” the report highlighted. 10x Research believes that treasury companies will struggle to attract new retail investors amid the current market environment, where existing shareholders are sitting on billions of dollars in losses. When NAV rises, “old” shareholders benefit; when it falls, the damage compounds, a dynamic DAT investors often underestimate. When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario. Unlike Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Digital Asset Treasuries “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns,” the report added, noting that many investors are unaware that DATs embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Moreover, 10x Research argued that with the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock, “the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny” as retail investors reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. Despite DAT challenges and ETH’s price action, BitMine has continued to bet on the King of Altcoins. According to Lookonchain data, a new wallet suspected to be linked to the Ethereum-focused treasury company purchased 21,054 ETH, worth around $66.57 million at the time, on Tuesday night. In its November Chairman’s Message, Thomas ‘Tom’ Lee, noted that the crypto market prices have not recovered from the October 10 liquidation event, and “the lingering weakness has the hallmarks of a market maker (or two) suffering from a crippled balance sheet.” BitMine does not believe crypto prices have peaked for this cycle, he added, suggesting that “a crypto cycle top is likely 12-36 months away.” On the contrary, Lee told CNBC News on Monday that the market is “pretty close” to bottoming this week. Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here. Notably, ETH has lost the $3,000 support for the first time since July, retesting the $2,800 area on Thursday morning. However, Lee has affirmed that “Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,840, a 29% decline in the monthly timeframe.

Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Plume says that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, has inked a deal to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. The real-world asset (RWA) market value could more than triple by 2026, as it expands beyond crypto-native use cases and utility, according to Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of RWA-focused layer-2 blockchain Plume. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Yin said that RWA value has taken off in the last year and he expects it to increase by three to five times in 2026, as a base case. “Currently, we are tracking to over 10x the RWA holders number since the start of the year and so we expect us to keep inflecting and we think it’s not crazy to imagine another banner year with 25x+ in user growth numbers,” he said. Over $35 billion in RWA is estimated to be onchain, according to RWA.xyz, across more than 539,000 holders. Yin said the market of tokenized RWAs is entirely serving crypto natives but predicts it will grow exponentially across total value, users, asset classes and utility. “Whereas today the vast majority of RWA value is in US treasury bills, the market maturing and the combination of rate cuts is pushing onchain users to seek higher yields in new places,” he said. Regulations could also play a factor. Many countries, such as the US, are working on legislation governing stablecoins and other tokenized assets. Yin said this will help move them out of the sandbox and into real-life usage soon. “Outside of pure issuance on the supply side, we expect to begin to see the demand side finally come onchain,” Yin added. Plume announced on Wednesday that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, plans to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. Related: Plume Network gains SEC transfer agent status to bring TradFi onchain The Nest staking protocol allows investors to trade and earn yield on tokenized assets. The partnership will connect Securitize’s tokenized funds to Plume’s network of over 280,000 RWA holders, according to Plume. Hamilton Lane funds will be the first, and then other issuers and asset classes from Securitize’s platform will follow in 2026. Plume has 279,692 RWA holders, which makes up around 50% of the total number of holders across all RWA networks. Plume, however, isn’t in the top ten networks according to RWA.xyz. However, Yin explains that Plume has a huge share of users, but each holder may have fewer RWA assets than on other networks. “Plume has 280,000 users holding an aggregate $200 million of RWAs, which is a much healthier measure of usage on a network,” he added.

Group’s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, backed Leave campaign Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty UK pub and hotel group JD Wetherspoon – whose founder campaigned for the UK to leave the EU – is using Ireland as a springboard for its expansion into mainland Europe to avoid Brexit-­induced red tape, the Irish Independent has learnt. The stock market-listed group, which owns a small number of pubs in Ireland, has been eyeing locations in Spain for its debut on the Continent. The new ventures will typically be operated on a franchise basis, following the success of franchise partnerships the group has in the UK with universities and a holiday parks firm. The first premises on the Continent is due to open next year. But UK trade with the EU now subject to significant barriers as a result of Brexit. Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty News in 90 Seconds - 21 November 2025 JD Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin was a strong advocate for Brexit, donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. Following the 2016 vote, the UK went on to leave the EU almost six years ago, hitting business between British firms and the trade bloc. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, which operates a total of about 800 pubs, confirmed that the pubs company will now use a newly established subsidiary in Dublin to launch its business in mainland Europe. “Given our current plans for a number of franchise sites in Europe, it is more straightforward if the agreements are between EU-based companies and JD Wetherspoon Europe has been set up [in Dublin] as a result,” he said. JD Wetherspoon opened its first pub in Ireland in 2014, with The Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Later the same year, it opened a premises in Dún Laoghaire. It later opened a handful of pubs in Cork, Carlow and Waterford. However, in 2023 it put those properties, as well as a premises it planned to open in Galway, up for sale. It sold The Three Tun Tavern in 2022. It still operates five pubs in Dublin. Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked After the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU in 2016, Mr Martin hailed the outcome of the referendum as a victory for democracy. “Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked,” he said in an interview with the BBC at the time. Addressing the International Monetary Fund last month, the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said that Brexit has caused long-term damage to the UK’s economy. The UK’s Office for Budgetary Responsibility recently claimed that Brexit will reduce the UK’s productivity by 4pc in the long term. Mr Martin, who was knighted in 2023, said in January this year that JD Wetherspoon is looking at expanding overseas. He cited destinations in Spain such as Alicante, Mallorca and Benidorm that are popular with British holidaymakers as the types of locations that would be suitable for the group. In the year to July 27, 2025, JD Wetherspoon reported revenue of £2.1bn (€2.4bn), a 17pc increase on the previous financial year. Its like-for-like sales rose 5.1pc and it made a pre-tax profit of £81.4m. The group held its annual general meeting yesterday .

Title: 6 hacks to a better government

Time Published: 2025-11-21T05:00:00Z

Antisocial people run in packs. They exert concentrated power, but they are decidedly in the minority. Prosocial people operate individualistically, but in the aggregate, they have much-greater power. Prosocial people can be defeated only by themselves. Many familiar practices don’t utilize power effectively. Some new practices also wouldn’t. Use power effectively these 6 ways: 1. Worship, love, and save. Individual faith in Christ limits the envy that stymies economic growth. Individual faith also strengthens lesser magistrates to limit greater magistrates, which secures individuals’ rights. Love is disciplined action that builds healthy relationships. Saving builds productivity. 2. Choose assets, and consumer products, whose producers do the least harm. Stocks provide the greatest long-term returns of any single class of investment. Choosing stocks in normal times, but choosing gold instead in crisis times, provides even-greater long-term returns. In normal times that include routine government-money-error cycles, stocks provide the greatest returns. In crisis times, when money producers have been more greatly inflating the money quantity, and more greatly suppressing profits, gold shelters assets and provides better returns. Shopping for the best added value is the key ingredient that makes voluntary cooperation select for the producers that add the most value. But this added value can give fund managers and corporate managers the power and control to pursue ends that harm everyone. Individuals can limit such harms by moving their investments out of funds like those of BlackRock and Vanguard, by supporting government officials who limit government pension investments in such funds, and by considering corporate managers’ harmful actions when choosing products like those of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target, and Disney. 3. Assess government people by how fully they use their constitutional powers against others in government and cronies. Government people are delegated powers through their jurisdictions’ charters. Government people’s powers are strikingly asymmetric. Government people have no lawful powers to defy the Constitution but awesome lawful powers and duties to support the Constitution. If government people use their lawful powers to limit only themselves, we need supermajorities before this will secure our freedoms. But if any government person also uses his lawful powers to limit others, then each single executive, bloc of legislators, or judge better secures our freedoms. Many politicians have much to say about what other people should do and are eager to do other people’s jobs, but they don’t do their own jobs. The only things politicians say or do that are worth supporting are actions to use constitutional powers to limit others in government and cronies. 4. Vote strategically for constitutionalists in Republican primaries and in general elections. Keep Republican Progressives from returning in subsequent elections as hard-to-dislodge incumbents. Register as a Republican if needed to vote, and in primaries vote for the most constitutionalist Republicans. In general elections, vote for the most constitutionalist candidates from any party. If you build support, more will follow. If a Progressive Democrat wins for the time being, others in the various branches and jurisdictions have the power and duty to undo any damage he might do. Of these others, Republicans are the only people who might limit Progressive Democrats; and Republican Progressives don’t. Wherever there’s unmitigated damage, Republican Progressives are the people we must hold accountable. 5. Support partial secessions of county regions from legacy state governments and of neighborhood regions from legacy city governments. The Constitution has a rule that the national government shall guarantee to each state ¾ really, to each state’s residents ¾ a republican form of government. A given government can assuredly be republican only if its charter has the same rules and sanctions as the Constitution. In state, county, and city charters, the ratifiers echo the Constitution’s design features but then layer on incompatible scope and administrative states. No state constitutions delegate only limited, enumerated powers. Just as state delegates ratified the Constitution in the USA, county delegates can ratify county-region constitutions within each state, and neighborhood delegates can ratify neighborhood-region constitutions within their cities. Compared to when the USA seceded from Great Britain, this is simpler. Now each region’s delegates can copy the Constitution. Also, now these delegates will be implementing the explicit governing law ¾ the Constitution ¾ whereas the legacy states or cities clearly aren’t. 6. Support a good party. Our fundamental political and therefore economic problem in our system of two major parties is that both are majority Progressive. If the economy is viewed as a process, then governments are impactful controls. If governments are viewed as processes, then parties are the key controls. Where the Constitution is designed to limit governments, party rules are designed to empower party organizations. For a good party, like for a seceding county region or neighborhood region, the Constitution is a model design solution. It’s ready-built and well examined. The fundamental solution is to build at least one major party with a party constitution that limits the party’s power. A good party will use a party constitution and complementary party laws to enact candidate selection processes that favor constitutionalist candidates. We can build a good party any of multiple ways: elect a president who uses his constitutional powers, partially secede from state governments, start neighborhood voter information meetings, take control of the Republican Party. Fail to fix at least one party, and no other solution will be sufficient — Not term limits, not other constitutional amendments. Fix at least one party, and its people will make quick, lasting work of the remaining problems. The more effectively that prosocial individuals use their powers, the more quickly that all people will live in increased freedom.

Bitcoin traded in the red for eight consecutive days amid intense selling pressure from holders. Aggressive selling by whales, miners, and institutions has intensified downward pressure on BTC’s price. The SMI Ergodic Oscillator and RVI both signal persistent bearish momentum and rising volatility. Since falling below the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin [BTC] has remained under that level for eight straight days, a stretch of losses not seen since the post-Liberation Day dip in early April. In fact, at press time, Bitcoin was trading at $92,229, up 0.38% on daily charts. Before these minor gains, BTC had been on a downward trajectory, dropping by 11.03% on weekly charts. Amid this prolonged bearish trend, prominent market players have capitulated and increased their spending significantly. Undoubtedly, BTC has continued to decline amid intense selling pressure from whales and other large entities. According to Checkonchain data, Holder Net Position Change has remained negative through Q4. Source: Checkonchain At the time of writing, this metric had declined to -60.07k BTC, the lowest levels since early August, reflecting intense selling from holders. In fact, Lookonchain observed such selling activity. According to the on-chain monitor, Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sold all his remaining 2,499 BTC, worth $228 million, via Kraken. The OG has been on an aggressive selling spree, dumping all 11k BTC, worth $1.12 billion, reflecting strong bearish sentiment from him. At the same time, BlackRock deposited another 6,735 BTC, valued at $616 million, into Coinbase Prime, further raising sell-off fears. Coupled with that, Bitcoin miners have also been on a selling spree, offloading 71.9k BTC over the past seven days. Mara Holdings is one such miner. According to Lookonchain, MARA deposited 644 BTC, worth $58.7 million, to FalconX and Coinbase Prime. Source: CryptoQuant Often, miners sell during a dip over thinning margins and are forced to offload to fund operational costs. In total, these three entities have offloaded 9,878 BTC, worth $902.7 million, over the past day. Typically, increased sales from these two groups add more pressure on an already weak market, risking further losses. According to AMBCrypto, Bitcoin’s downtrend has prolonged as it grapples with increased selling from holders. As a result, the SMI Ergodic Oscillator has remained negative for nine consecutive days, settling at -0.03 at press time, indicating sellers’ dominance. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Relative Volatility Index (RVI) has remained below 50 for eight straight days, a level that typically indicates increasing downside volatility and strengthening bearish momentum. Given these conditions, BTC remains vulnerable to further losses. If selling pressure persists alongside rising volatility, Bitcoin could dip below the $90,000 mark once again. Should the $88,000 support level break, the next key support lies near $86,482. To reverse this bearish outlook, BTC would need a daily close above $93,428.

Title: Bitwise XRP ETF sees $21.7M turnover on debut but closes the day lower

The Bitwise XRP ETF posted $21.7M in turnover on 20 November, but will it match-up with Canary’s XRPC? The Bitwise XRP ETF reported $21.7 million in turnover, with 1.13 million shares traded, but closed 7% lower at $22.46 after opening at $24.15. Canary’s XRPC controls $268.88M in assets with $292.61M in cumulative inflows since launch, while still recording $15.82M in fresh inflows on 19 November. Finviz data shows the XRP ETF opened at $24.15, traded between $24.15 and $22.12, and closed at $22.46—reflecting a 7% decline from the opening print. Total dollar volume reached approximately $26 million, indicating significant participation from active traders and market makers. Source: Finviz According to data from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, three hours before the market close, the Bitwise XRP saw $21.7 million in turnover, with more than 1.13 million shares traded. The launch marks the second U.S. spot XRP ETF to hit the market, arriving one week after Canary Funds’ XRPC. Bitwise enters a competitive landscape where Canary’s XRPC has already captured $292.61 million in cumulative inflows. SoSoValue data shows XRPC controls $268.88 million in total net assets, representing 0.22% of XRP’s market cap. The fund recorded $15.82 million in net inflows on 19 November alone, demonstrating sustained institutional demand days after its initial launch. Despite arriving second, Seyffart described Bitwise’s turnover as “impressive.” Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg congratulated Bitwise on the launch, noting that strong first-day activity proves “you don’t have to be BlackRock to launch a top ETF.” The ETF’s price action tracked broader crypto market weakness throughout the day. XRP’s underlying spot market experienced volatility, and the ETF traded in line with those movements. The decline into the close raises questions about whether institutional investors allocated fresh capital on Day 1 or whether activity came primarily from secondary-market trading. Official flow figures will only become available after the next settlement cycle, when authorized participants and issuers publish updated fund holdings. Platforms including SoSoValue, Farside Investors, and Bloomberg Terminal will reflect this data on 21 November. Bitwise positioned the ETF as a low-fee option for U.S.-regulated XRP exposure. Tomorrow’s data will reveal whether strong trading interest translated into meaningful institutional allocations that can compete with Canary’s head start.

Title: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The conversation around XRP has grown louder in recent months as the asset continues to gain traction through ecosystem growth, Spot XRP ETFs, and market interest. Despite this momentum, XRP still sits far below Bitcoin, the industry’s dominant cryptocurrency, when comparing total valuation. That gap raises a simple question: how high would the XRP price need to climb in order to actually flip Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf provides a direct, real-time look at what XRP’s price would be if it matched Bitcoin’s market capitalization today. Although it is currently going through a correction phase, Bitcoin has the largest presence in the crypto market by an overwhelming margin, and its market capitalization currently stands at roughly $1.84 trillion. This valuation ranks Bitcoin among the largest assets on the planet, surpassing many global corporations. XRP, now trading around $2.14 at the time of writing, holds a market cap of approximately $128.7 billion. This means Bitcoin’s valuation is more than fourteen times larger than XRP’s. For XRP to flip Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency would need to rise to the same market capitalization that Bitcoin currently holds. Using the circulating supply of XRP, MarketCapOf calculates how much each XRP token would be worth if it matched Bitcoin’s market cap. Based on the latest data, XRP would need to trade at $30.61 for its total valuation to equal Bitcoin’s. This is the current “flippening price,” and it reflects the direct ratio between their two market caps. To reach the level of Bitcoin’s all-time high market cap of $2.485 trillion recorded on October 6, XRP would need to climb to about $41.26 per token. The calculation highlights how far ahead Bitcoin still is. XRP sits at roughly seven percent of Bitcoin’s total valuation, meaning the asset would need to appreciate more than fourteen times from its current level to stand on equal footing. In simple terms, an investor holding 1,000 XRP would see their position shift from about $2,140 today to more than $30,000 if the token were priced at $30.61. This comparison does not assume any change in circulating supply, tokenomics, or macro factors. It is a clean and direct valuation exercise based purely on market capitalization. However, even in its simplicity, it shows the scale of inflows required for XRP to close the gap and flip Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency rankings. Recent months have seen stronger activity in the Ripple ecosystem, most especially with new partnerships and acquisitions by Ripple. Added to this is the expanding conversation around Spot XRP ETFs, which many analysts believe could introduce significant liquidity if major issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale fully enter the space. The newest entrant is Bitwise, which launched its Spot XRP ETF just hours ago.

Title: From Big To Bigger: Abu Dhabi Investment Council Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure

Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, growing from about 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by September 30. The position was valued at roughly $518 million at quarter end. According to market reports, that build-up happened just before Bitcoin hit new highs in early October, when prices crossed the $125,000 mark. The timing left the fund with a much larger exposure to Bitcoin-linked ETFs right as investor sentiment became far more volatile. A sovereign fund increasing an ETF position by this scale sends a clear message about how some big public investors now see crypto: as an asset class worth holding. That does not mean the bet is risk-free. ETF shares can be redeemed, market swings can be sharp, and paper gains can evaporate quickly when prices reverse. Reports indicate ADIC treated the ETF as a long-term store of value, but short-term price action has already tested that view. JUST IN: 🇦🇪 UAE state fund triples its stake in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 19, 2025 Spot ETFs then faced heavy redemptions in November. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a record single-day outflow of about $523 million, marking the largest one-day withdrawal since the ETF launched in January 2024. The outflow was part of a run of redemptions that month and signaled growing caution among some holders. Those redemptions came as bitcoin slid from its October highs. The pullback has left some big buyers holding positions that look less favorable on paper. Some analysts argue these moves—both buying and selling at scale—are part of a normal allocation cycle for institutional investors. Others warn rapid inflows and outflows can magnify price swings for everyone in the market. According to the coverage, ADIC’s increase shows that parts of the global investing community are prepared to use regulated US ETFs to gain bitcoin exposure. That preference for regulated vehicles can increase the pool of buyers in good times, while also creating new pressure points when sentiment shifts and large redemptions occur. A big public fund made a bold move into bitcoin via a major US ETF and did so just before the market cooled. The trade highlights both the growing mainstream interest in crypto and the risks that come with fast moves in and out of large ETF positions. In the meantime, the facts are straightforward: holdings spiked to nearly 8 million IBIT shares worth about $518 million at quarter end, and the ETF later saw a record $523 million single-day outflow as prices fell from early October highs.

Title: Why were stocks down today? What to know as Dow gives up 700-point gain

U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. "Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026," wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. "This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute," said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. "After all, after the headlines settle, stocks ultimately trade on earnings." And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. "NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat," said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. "Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth," she said. "Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. "Investors looking for an explanation for the current market pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced," said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. "Questions around the Fed’s interest-rate path, labor market, legal ruling on tariffs, and government shutdown are just a few of them. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result." The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. "Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we’re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy," Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering "what’s typically a seasonally strong stretch," Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase "Santa Claus rally." The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: Private Credit Becomes Core as JPMorgan Rethinks 60/40 Model

Private credit and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. November 20, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset management arm is pitching private markets as essential ballast to investor portfolios amid stretched stock valuations and unreliable bond hedges. With stock gains increasingly driven by a handful of large caps and bonds potentially offering less protection in downturns, the traditional 60/40 portfolio mix needs reinforcement, the $4 trillion asset manager said in its 2026 investment outlook. Private credit, so-called secondaries — markets where limited partners can sell their stakes to other institutions — and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. “A key reason for having bonds in a portfolio is that they are supposed to zag when stocks zig. But if stocks zig and bonds zig too, then you lose the diversification benefit from diversification into bonds,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This is where alternatives come in.” Private credit is the centerpiece of JPMorgan’s view, with strategists pointing to its “healthy premium” over public debt. But they also highlight the need for range of investments as ways to build resilience if growth slows. Read more: Private Credit Leans on Secondaries as Investor Payouts Dwindle Related:AssetMark Adds Private Markets to its Platform Wall Street has proposed tweaks to 60/40 for years — adding commodities, real estate and even crypto to investment strategies. But the recent surge of institutional flows into private markets signals something more permanent. What once lived at the edges of a portfolio is now being folded into its foundation. The shift isn’t without controversy. Critics warn that some of the benefits — from diversification to downside protection — may not hold when markets come under pressure. Liquidity gaps and opaque pricing remain key concerns as more capital moves in. Still, JPMorgan’s “60/40+” framing captures a broader turn: The old playbook hasn’t been discarded, but it is being rewritten — this time around assets that used to sit on the sidelines. Kelly argues that investors can reallocate to alternatives by trimming both stocks and bonds in line with their original 60/40 split — preserving balance while shifting portfolio structure. “Investors can fund a 10% position or a 20% position or a 30% position in alternatives proportionately from the 60% stocks, 40% bonds and just make each of those slices smaller,” Kelly added. “And if they do that, we think it gives better diversification, more stability in the portfolio going forward.” Related:Q&A: Is a Private Market Tokenization Revolution Coming? Read more: BlackRock Says 2% Bitcoin Allocation Is ‘Reasonable Range’ So far this year, megacap tech stocks have lifted the markets higher with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 posting double-digit gains. Still, concerns over concentrated and highly valued public AI equities — such as the Magnificent 7 comprising some 35% of the S&P 500 and the index’s forward P/E reaching 23x — are pushing some investors toward alternative assets with lower market correlation. “Everyone’s very excited about AI and, indeed, we are excited about AI, too,” Kelly said. “But the question is: Does AI justify the valuations of all of these huge megacap companies, or is it going to be a day of reckoning? Chances are, eventually, something will go wrong and there will be a day of reckoning.” Looking ahead, artificial intelligence remains a central theme as the technology shifts from so-called proofs-of-concept to large-scale adoption. According to the outlook, entitled AI Lift and Economic Drift, investors are now shifting focus on where to allocate capital across the AI value chain, with private markets offering broad opportunities from venture capital to data-center infrastructure. For instance, the outlook cites how massive hyperscaler spending is effectively channeling value from public to private markets, where private equity, infrastructure and private credit funds are driving the build-outs.As for the broader economy, Kelly does not foresee a recession in the year ahead, though he admits that worries about the outlook continue to persist. Related:KKR, Apollo Back Blockchain Infrastructure Platform Corastone “We think the economy will grow at a moderate pace. Perhaps for most Americans, it’s going to feel like a pretty mediocre, disappointing economy,” Kelly said. “But there’s enough of a surge in capital spending coming from the AI boom and in consumer spending from the increase in wealth of richer households that should keep this economy growing, barring some shocks.” RIA Edge Private Markets Dec 4, 2025 New York The only forum designed exclusively for senior RIA investment decision-makers to engage directly with the leading players in private markets.

Title: Aramco Redefines Oil Power in $120 Billion U.S. Tech and LNG Alliance

Presently he works as Director of Energy Security and Supply Chains, at Strategy… More Info The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code. Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion. Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just about crude exports and arms sales; the message has become different. It represents a multi-layered energy, technology, and supply-chain bargain that puts Aramco at the center, with geopolitics written into it in capitals. For decades, Aramco’s main asset in the USA has been Motiva in Port Arthur, Texas. Its role is clear: Motiva has completed a debottlenecking that makes Port Arthur the largest refinery in the US, capable of processing about 654,000 bpd. Aramco indicated in May 2025 that it will invest another $3.4 billion to further integrate the refinery into a larger petrochemicals and fuels complex. The current moves made by Saudi Arabia and Aramco show, however, a sweeping change from crude oil to American-made supply chain products, as these downstream dollars sit alongside a sweeping web of MOUs with US industrial and service champions: At the same time, the Kingdom and Aramco have set their sights on access to US financial services and capital markets. Both are already showing results, as seen in the agreements with PIMCO, State Street, Wellington, and Wall Street banks, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. The main moves are to create dedicated vehicles, such as a “Fund of One,” to channel Saudi capital into US infrastructure and transition assets. The 'Fund of One' is a financial mechanism that enables Saudi Arabia to invest its capital directly in specific US projects, thereby supporting the US economy and safeguarding its long-term interests. Related: New Iraqi Leadership Confronts Water Shortage and Economic Strain While most are focusing on the synergies between US President Trump and his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kingdom's underlying strategic moves are guided by the well-known Saudi Vision 2030. Riyadh uses all projects and arrangements to lock in technology, services, and financing, mainly meant for local Saudi Vision 2030 projects. At the same time, these moves are diversifying Aramco’s earnings away from pure upstream oil, showcasing the company's adaptability. The Trump Administration, at the same time, wants to keep Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most prominent investors and energy suppliers, deeply entangled in the US industrial base amid growing competition with China. The most strategic moves are seen in the LNG sphere. The Saudi oil giant is pursuing a clear gas pivot, while the USA sees it as an export machine. This shift has significant geopolitical implications, as it not only changes the dynamics of the global gas trade but also impacts the energy security strategies of both Saudi Arabia and the USA. Again, geopolitics, economics, and strategy are merging. Natural gas is the most strategic part of all. Saudi Arabia’s leading revenue maker, Aramco, has slowly but steadily repositioned itself from an oil-only behemoth toward becoming a serious LNG player. US export capacity has been assessed and approved as one of its main springboards. LNG markets have been woken up since April 2025 by Saudi moves, following the signing of a 20-year sale-and-purchase agreement by a subsidiary of Aramco with NextDecade. The latter SPA entails the delivery of 1.2 Mtpa of LNG from Train 4 of the Rio Grande project in Texas. According to current info, the project’s first phase is already under construction, with full build-out expected to cost around $18 billion. A year earlier, in June 2024, Aramco had already struck a heads-of-agreement with Sempra Infrastructure for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion. The HOA also includes an option to take a 25 percent equity stake. Since May 2025, Aramco has been framing these commitments, 6.2 Mtpa initially, holding an ambition to reach 7.5 Mtpa by 2030. For the Saudis, these deals are seen as the backbone of a global gas portfolio that complements their oil exports. On the geopolitical stage, these deals and strategies are doing three things: Trump is also looking at a significant win, as Saudi capital and contracts will support US LNG expansion. This will significantly enhance Washington's power to lock in long-term influence over the global gas trade, a testament to the weight of these strategic moves. Another significant issue should also be addressed, linked to a combination of supply chains, critical minerals, and de-risking from China. Both parties have been very subtle in their moves to rewire supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Already at the broader US–Saudi Investment Forum, both parties have flagged agreements not only in energy but also in critical minerals and industrial inputs central to batteries, renewables, and advanced manufacturing. The goals of Aramco in this regard are clear; they want to secure long-term access to catalysts, metals, control systems, and specialized equipment that underpin both conventional and low-carbon projects. Washington’s goal is to ensure that a key Middle Eastern partner sources more of its strategic inputs from American or allied producers rather than from Chinese suppliers, as Trump seeks to counter or mitigate Beijing's growing influence in the Kingdom. For both parties, it is a form of mutual de-risking. The need for supply-chain interdependence matters to both. While Washington wants to block China, Riyadh wants the option to arbitrage between US, European, and Asian suppliers. Current Aramco-led deals are effectively creating a new layer of sunk-cost interdependence. If in place, these will make a sharp political rupture more expensive for both capitals. Overall, energy and AI are also explicitly fused into the relationship. Both countries have announced a US–Saudi AI Strategic Partnership aimed at making the Kingdom a “global AI leader.” Washington is reportedly considering approving the first sales of advanced AI chips to the Saudi venture Humain. The latter would open a controlled channel for high-end semiconductors into the Kingdom. Again, Aramco plays a pivotal role in all of this. In recent months, Aramco has already announced partnerships with Nvidia for AI and robotics infrastructure, AWS for cloud and environmental digitalization, and Qualcomm for advanced industrial connectivity. The geopolitical cloud is very relevant, as AI will give Aramco an operational edge, especially by enabling it to model reservoirs more effectively, optimize production and trading, and monitor infrastructure for cyber and physical threats. Again, the Kingdom’s role as the world’s default swing producer and system stabilizer is at play. The Saudi-US tech stack will also serve as a counterweight to Chinese solutions from firms like Huawei. Washington will also gain export control leverage, as it retains the ability to tighten or loosen access to advanced chips and cloud services. This will increase US leverage on Saudi decision-making, this time outside of oil and gas. It is also part of a new systemology that complements or substitutes for traditional defense and arms sales tools. Aramco’s main AI goal is not only focused on efficiency but also on gaining access to US-centered digital ecosystems. Beijing, as the leading competitor, will certainly notice this new alignment. International media have been discussing, especially, nuclear energy, defense, and security. Trump has clearly framed the broader package as a historic deepening of economic and defense ties, highlighting up to $1 trillion in prospective Saudi spending that spans nuclear energy, F-35 fighter jets, advanced chips, and energy investments. A Saudi-US civilian nuclear deal, worth several billions of dollars, was also signed after years of slow negotiations. Washington has clearly indicated that it wants Saudi nuclear and AI development to happen under American, not Beijing’s, umbrella. Even though Aramco is not a defense company, all its deals cannot be separated from the security architecture surrounding them, including oil and gas security, infrastructure hardening, and gas as a strategic commodity. Reality is again that all of the latter amounts to a renewed oil-for-security bargain. The only change is that it has been set up in a much more complex form: crude plus LNG, plus AI and chips, backed by US naval power and advanced weapons. Optimism is high, but….the proof is in the eating of the pudding, or maybe in this case, a bowl of Umm Ali. The MOUs will need to move from paper-based to hard assets. It is still to be seen how much of the $120 billion in Aramco MOUs will materialize into contracts, equity stakes, or shovel-ready projects. At the same time, will there be more or deeper US equity in Saudi projects? As Saudi Arabia opens more upstream and downstream assets to international capital – from gas fields to petrochemical complexes – US firms could seek larger equity stakes. Washington will push for this to balance the substantial positions held by Chinese and other Asian companies. Nuclear will be a long-term project; assessments will be needed. At the same time, all deals will be affected by political risk in both capitals. On the sidelines of all, but not to be forgotten, GCC countries will be assessing the changes too. Qatar and the UAE will be reassessing their relative positions towards the USA and within their existing bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia will be seeking a more prominent position, perhaps at Qatar's expense. As stated before, the situation is in flux and moving to different levels. When looking at the US-Saudi relationship, current moves are not a nostalgic return to the 1970s oil-for-bases deal, but a 21st-century variant in which Aramco serves as the hinge between hydrocarbons, LNG, digital infrastructure, and security. Washington will use its LNG-AI-high-end manufacturing links to ensure that a critical Gulf power stays within the Western strategic orbit and helps underwrite Atlantic energy security in an era of great-power rivalry. Riyadh’s position is clear: by locking in US infrastructure, chips, capital, and naval protection, it buys not only insurance for its own diversification but also supports Aramco’s transition from a pure oil major to a broader energy-and-technology platform. The coming months and years will depend on whether both sides can manage the inevitable frictions (human rights, regional wars, OPEC+ policy, or China) without lunging into a position of weaponizing the very interdependence they are now deepening. If successful, the Aramco-led wave of deals could mark the beginning of a more stable, if more complex, US–Saudi compact. In case of a significant failure, markets will need to understand that the same network of LNG contracts, AI clouds, and supply-chain ties will become the terrain on which the next phase of geopolitical competition is fought. For current developments, a clearer option exists: the personal relationship between MBS and Trump, two transactional powers holding options to change a region. As long as both sides can prevent a Zelensky situation, positive results can be made.

Title: Private Credit Firms to Swap Debt for Equity in Stressed 48Forty

Private credit lenders are poised to take control of pallet company 48Forty Solutions, about a year after providing $1.75 billion of debt to support Summit Partners’ acquisition of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A group of lenders including Antares Capital are set to take equity in 48Forty under a proposed restructuring slated to close by the end of the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Other lenders include KKR & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc., the people said. The deal would shed about $1 billion of liabilities from 48Forty’s balance sheet as lenders swap their debt for a stake, the people said. As part of the proposal, lenders including Antares will inject around $75 million of new debt into 48Forty, they said. Representatives for Antares, KKR, BlackRock and Carlyle declined to comment. 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. In cases where borrowers are struggling with their liabilities, private credit firms are more frequently swapping their debt positions for equity stakes to try and prevent losses. While swaps can produce upside, they also offer more unpredictable returns than direct loans, which are designed to provide stable income over time. Lenders proposed a debt restructuring for 48Forty earlier this year. The company, which was already paying the majority of the interest on its debt in kind, stopped paying interest in August, according to the people. FS KKR Capital Corp., a fund jointly managed by KKR and Future Standard, marked down the value of a loan to 48Forty to about 46 cents on the dollar in the third quarter, from around 86 cents a year ago, according to a filing. With the restructuring, plans to cut costs could include shuttering multiple pallet recycling plants, the people said, though no decision on closures has been made. 48Forty, which provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada, currently has 73 plants, according to its website. Lenders are also looking to appoint a new board for the company, the people said. Antares and KKR will each have two appointments, while Carlyle and BlackRock will jointly agree on one appointment, and first-lien lenders will all agree on another, they said. The last board seat will be reserved for the company’s chief executive officer. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on November 19, breaking a five-day outflow streak. Yes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47M in net inflows on 19 November, breaking a brutal 5-day outflow streak that drained institutional money. IBIT bounced back with $60.61M in inflows—a dramatic reversal from the historic $523M outflow just one day earlier on 18 November. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on 19 November, snapping a five-day outflow streak that tested institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. The reversal arrived as BTC stabilized near $90,000, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the recovery just one day after suffering its worst exodus on record. Source: SoSoValue SoSoValue data shows the turnaround marks a critical shift in sentiment. The five-day bleeding period saw institutional money flee Bitcoin ETFs as price broke below key support levels and Fed rate cut expectations collapsed. IBIT contributed $60.61 million in inflows on 19 November, completely reversing course from the historic $523 million outflow recorded on 18 November. That single-day exodus represented the largest redemption in IBIT’s history, dragging the entire ETF market into negative territory. The rapid reversal suggests institutional sellers exhausted themselves during the five-day decline. Buyers stepped in as Bitcoin held support near $89,000, viewing the dip as an accumulation opportunity rather than the start of a deeper correction. Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund added another $53.84 million in inflows, continuing its pattern of attracting institutional capital even during broader market weakness. The fund has consistently posted positive flows while larger competitors experienced volatility. Not all ETFs participated in the recovery. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded -$21.35 million in outflows, extending its own streak of redemptions. VanEck’s HODL posted -$17.63 million in exits. Meanwhile, most mid-sized and smaller ETFs, including GBTC, ARKB, BITB, and others, recorded zero net flows. The concentration of activity in IBIT and Grayscale’s mini BTC fund suggests institutional money remains selective about which vehicles they use for Bitcoin exposure. Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs now sit at $117.34 billion, representing roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Despite recent volatility, the category has maintained structural growth since its launch in January 2024. The $75 million inflow may seem modest compared to the hundreds of millions that fled during the five-day streak. But the directional change matters more than the magnitude. Breaking a five-day outflow pattern signals that institutional selling pressure has eased. If flows remain positive or neutral over the next week, it would confirm that the November selloff represented profit-taking rather than a fundamental shift in institutional demand. Bitcoin currently trades at $89,516.91, down from recent highs near $100,000 but holding above the critical $88,000-$90,000 support zone. The ETF reversal suggests institutions view current levels as attractive entry points rather than the beginning of a deeper downturn.

Share this article US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75 million in net inflows yesterday, ending a five-day streak of outflows as institutional investors resumed accumulating the digital asset. BlackRock, the global investment management firm operating the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), led the buying activity alongside Grayscale’s mini ETF, which also contributed to the positive flows. These two products were the only ones driving net inflows, while most other issuers saw flat activity. VanEck and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded net outflows, signaling a more cautious stance among other providers during the market reversal. The renewed institutional interest marks a shift from recent selling pressure that had dominated Bitcoin ETF flows. BlackRock has consistently been among the top contributors to Bitcoin ETF inflows since the products launched, helping drive institutional adoption of crypto assets.

Title: BlackRock’s Staked Ethereum ETF Play Could Supercharge Bitcoin Hyper

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: BlackRock just spun up a new trust in Delaware for an iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, signaling phase two of institutional crypto: yield on-chain, wrapped in TradFi. Roughly 15 months after launching its flagship Ethereum ETF, $ETHA, the asset management giant is now lining up a product that combines $ETH price exposure with staking rewards. $ETHA, which launched in July 2024, has already pulled in around $13B in inflows and quickly became one of the most successful spot Ethereum ETFs on the market. The key detail: ETHA itself does not stake its $ETH, so investors get pure price exposure alone, and nothing from the roughly 4% average staking yield that validators earn on-chain. The new trust changes that equation. A staked $ETH ETF would transform Ethereum exposure into a total-return product, tacking on staking yield to capital gains. That kind of structure is tailor-made for institutions that want the benefits of blockchain without running their own validator infrastructure or worrying about slashing risks. When big money gets comfortable with yield-bearing crypto ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the usual pattern is simple: liquidity and attention trickle down the risk curve. First majors, then high-beta infrastructure plays. In this cycle, one of the cleanest ways to express that ‘higher beta on Bitcoin’ thesis is not another meme coin, but a Bitcoin Layer-2 like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that tracks Bitcoin’s performance while adding real utility. That is where Bitcoin Hyper’s ongoing presale starts to look very interesting. Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 rollup on top of Bitcoin that batches transactions off-chain, executes them at high speed, then settles the final state back to Bitcoin Layer-1. In practice, it aims to turn Bitcoin into something that feels closer to Solana in terms of speed, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. To do this, the team uses a canonical bridge that wraps native $BTC into a compatible asset for use on the Hyper rollup. A Solana Virtual Machine environment then handles execution, enabling thousands of transactions per second and near-instant finality. This is the pain point Bitcoin Hyper goes after: Bitcoin is the largest, most trusted asset in crypto, yet still awkward to use beyond simple transfers and custody. Fees spike in every hype cycle, throughput caps out around single-digit TPS, and DeFi flows largely bypass the network. By pushing computation to an L2 while anchoring security on Bitcoin, Hyper tries to unlock that trapped value. The next logical step is infrastructure that lets those assets actually move and work in DeFi. A Bitcoin-native L2 that can route wrapped BTC into lending, DEXs, and payments is directly aligned with that shift. Add in the project’s public focus on conservative security assumptions, and the narrative becomes straightforward: a scaling solution that respects the base chain, rather than trying to replace it. On the numbers side, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $28M, with the current token price sitting at $0.013305. That puts it in the upper tier of the best crypto presales of 2025 and suggests there is real appetite for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure rather than just memes. Staking is a major part of the pitch. Early buyers can stake $HYPER for reported rewards of around 41%, turning idle presale allocations into a yield-bearing position while the team ships its roadmap. Learn how to buy and stake $HYPER today. There is also a clear roadmap-linked upside story. Our price modeling sees potential highs of $0.08625 in 2026 if Bitcoin Hyper hits its milestones around mainnet, early dApps, and DAO launch. For holders who already believe in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and see BlackRock-style products as confirmation, $HYPER acts like a leveraged play on that same thesis: more throughput, more DeFi rails, and more ways for $BTC liquidity to earn yield. In other words, while BlackRock stays tightly focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, investors who want to front-run where that institutional adoption might push demand next are looking directly at Bitcoin Layer-2s. Right now, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the few presales offering that combination of narrative fit, clear technical design, and significant capital already committed. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale.

Modular RWA-focused layer 2 blockchain Plume announced Wednesday that tokenization giant Securitize is set to expand its footprint in DeFi by rolling out institutional-grade assets on Plume's Nest staking protocol. The partnership, underscoring the growing convergence of traditional finance and DeFi infrastructures, will connect BlackRock and Morgan Stanley-backed Securitize's tokenized funds to Plume's network of over 280,000 real-world asset (RWA) holders – supposedly the largest RWA investor community globally. In essence, Securitize's institutional-grade assets gain another robust onchain venue to move, trade and earn yield at scale. All underlying assets are issued and managed under Securitize’s rigorous regulatory framework, ensuring transparency, full auditability, and compliance. Plume's Nest staking protocol lets investors move, trade, and earn yield on tokenized assets within a regulated and composable DeFi ecosystem, supported by Bluprynt's Know-Your-Issuer verification system for enhanced transparency and trust. "Through Plume, we’re connecting institutional-grade assets to one of the largest communities of onchain RWA holders anywhere in the world. This collaboration represents a major step toward realizing truly global, transparent, and accessible digital capital markets," Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Teddy Pornprinya, co-founder and CBO of Plume, emphasized that the on-chain world operates under the same principle as traditional markets: distribution determines scale. He explained that tokenized assets require liquidity, reach, and composability to realize their potential, capabilities Plume is uniquely positioned to provide. “Securitize sets the gold standard in compliant issuance. Plume delivers the global distribution, composability, and liquidity layer that makes these assets come alive in DeFi," Pornprinya said. The rollout starts with Hamilton Lane funds and will expand through 2026, targeting $100 million in capital, according to the press release. As a part of the deal, Bitcoin finance platform Solv plans to invest up to $10 million in Plume's RWA vaults, broadening BTC-based yield offerings with regulated, real-world asset exposures. Speaking on the matter, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, stressed BTC's role in yield-bearing markets. “As regulated on-chain markets emerge, bitcoin will underpin a new generation of yield, credit, and liquidity infrastructure, where demand for yield-bearing bitcoin with RWA-backed yields replaces passive treasuries as the next phase of institutional adoption," Chow said.

Title: BlackRock staked Ethereum ETF takes shape – All details here!

BlackRock eyes staking integration as SEC clears path for advanced crypto ETFs after Nasdaq’s July filing. It’s often the first public sign that a new ETF may be in development before formal regulatory filings. Instead of just spot exposure, this product appears to focus on staking, allowing yield generation. BlackRock is once again signaling deeper ambitions in the Ethereum [ETH] ecosystem. Fresh corporate filings in Delaware reveal a new entity named the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager is exploring a staked Ethereum product. The registration was filed by BlackRock Managing Director Daniel Schweiger, the same individual behind the firm’s original iShares Ethereum fund in 2023. This move signals a potential expansion beyond simple spot exposure, suggesting interest in yield-generating, staking-based investment products. Importantly, a Delaware name registration often serves as the first public clue that a new ETF may be in the works. Analysts believe this case is no exception, interpreting it as an early step toward a broader crypto investment strategy. This development follows Nasdaq’s updated 19b-4 filing in July, which requested approval to add staking capabilities to BlackRock’s existing iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The current filing indicates that BlackRock may be pursuing not just a new product, but also enhancing its current Ethereum offerings with staking features. This momentum comes on the heels of the SEC’s recent approval of listing options for spot Bitcoin ETFs, clearing a major regulatory barrier for more advanced crypto fund structures. In fact, according to Eric Balchunas, a memo from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) earlier this week marked the final key approval required before these derivative products launch. Remarking on which, Blachunas added, “Now it’s just a matter of when, not if. We will get the exact data as soon as we can.” This comes at a time when BlackRock appears uninterested in pursuing any altcoin ETF filings, even as institutions accelerate efforts around Solana and XRP products. Reflecting this stance, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, said, “Most of the altcoins as worthless.” For example, in October, Grayscale secured approval to enable staking for two of its U.S.-listed funds: the Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and the Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). This milestone made them the first spot-market ETFs, publicly registered under the Securities Act of 1933, to offer staking rewards—marking a significant step forward in regulated crypto investment products. Earlier this year, REX-Osprey also introduced a staking-enabled Solana ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940, later expanding its portfolio with an ETH staking fund using the same structure in September. However, while U.S. regulators and asset managers continue to navigate the complexities of staking-enabled ETFs, other markets are moving faster. Hong Kong’s ChinaAMC, for instance, launched the world’s first spot Solana [SOL] ETF earlier today, trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The product offers exposure in HKD, RMB, and USD with a 0.99% annual management fee, effectively beating U.S. competitors to market by several weeks. Thus, with Hong Kong already approving spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs, the region is positioning itself as a global hub for tokenized capital markets. Meanwhile, on the price front, Ethereum was trading at $3,023.18, down 0.88% over the past 24 hours and nearly 15% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, institutional sentiment also appears equally strained, with Ethereum ETFs recording continuous withdrawals since 11th November. On the 18th of November alone, the sector saw $74.2 million in outflows, followed by $37.4 million on the 19th of November. BlackRock’s own ETHA fund has led this downtrend, logging $165.1 million and $24.6 million in outflows on the same respective dates, the highest among its peers. Yet, despite this bearish flow cycle, regulatory milestones continue to reshape the landscape.

Walmart Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, said it will move its stock listing to the Nasdaq, marking the largest defection in the New York Stock Exchange’s history. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, which has been on the NYSE since 1972, said it expects its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the highest of the exchange’s three tiers, on Dec. 9. The move to the tech-heavy Nasdaq reflects Walmart’s “technology-forward approach,” the retailer said, and it will transfer the listing of nine bonds to the exchange as well. Its stock will trade under its current ticker symbol, “WMT.” Large companies have made the move before, with PepsiCo Inc. abandoning its nearly century-long listing on the NYSE in 2017. With a market capitalization of about $166 billion at the time, it was then the biggest company to transfer to Nasdaq, later topped by Linde Plc, which shifted to Nasdaq with a value of roughly $180 billion at the time. Walmart’s market cap, meanwhile, tops $800 billion. Nasdaq said last year that some 40 members of the S&P 500 have migrated, with 24 of those companies now in the Nasdaq-100 index. Both Nasdaq and the NYSE have lured companies away from each other’s venues in recent years, and moves can include perks such as marketing and cost savings. The NYSE said it’s attracted 347 companies from Nasdaq, including Virtu Financial Inc., which transferred over earlier this year. While Nasdaq and the NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., dominate US stock listings, competition from new entrants is intensifying. The upstart Texas Stock Exchange, backed by investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities, has received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and plans to begin trading in 2026. The exchanges are also grappling with the growing trend among companies to stay private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs and regulatory oversight associated with operating a publicly traded company.

BTC price fell from $115,699.2 level as on September 20, 2025 to $91,835.5 as on 18:30 IST, November 20, down 21 per cent. ETH fell from $4,480.41 to $3,028.86 during same period, down 32 per cent. BTC touched its all-time high of $126,198.07 just last month, while ETH hit an all-time high of $4,953.73 in August, according to investing.com and coinmarket cap. Sumit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX, said over the past month, both BTC and ETH have experienced elevated volatility primarily due to macro-driven liquidity shifts and profit-booking by short-term market participants. Bitcoin dropping below the $90,000 mark the first time since April has been influenced by US-China tariff row, tightening global liquidity, uncertainty around US fiscal conditions, and rapid position unwinding by leveraged traders. “At the same time, broader market sentiment has been oscillating, as investors reassess risk assets amid mixed inflation cues and shifting expectations around interest rate policy. Even blue-chip tokens are not insulated from these forces. However, it’s important to note that the structural fundamentals for BTC and ETH remain intact,” he said. He added that recent ETF flow data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen about $2.59 billion in outflows this month, with BlackRock’s IBIT recording roughly $1.26 billion outflows and Fidelity’s FBTC around $540 million. These outflows indicate investor repositioning, Gupta says, but they should not be interpreted as a strategic exit by major institutions. According to Vikas Gupta, Country Manager at Bybit India, while some of the recent decline appears to be driven by profit-booking rather than any meaningful exit from long-term institutional investors, BTC’s breach of key technical support levels has intensified the market reaction, triggering automated liquidations and resulting in steeper price swings. The trend line support in the $95,000–$100,000 range also appears to have been breached, leading to heavy liquidations and reducing stability at current levels. “Recent on-chain data indicates notable outflows from BTC and ETH wallets controlled by large institutions, and this is also visible in ETF redemptions led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. As a result, this has raised questions about whether large financial institutions are actually reducing their exposure to crypto assets. However, these outflows appear to be driven by short-term profit-taking and regular portfolio rebalancing rather than a long-term exit from the crypto space,” he said. Aishwary Gupta, Global Head of Payments at Polygon Labs, said technically BTC is still in a post-halving cyclical uptrend, but with much more institutional flow this time. As long as it holds its higher-lows structure on the weekly chart, the broader bull cycle remains intact, even with deep corrections. The key levels to watch are the prior cycle’s range highs as support zones, and the ETF-driven “price discovery” area as resistance. If those supports hold through macro volatility, BTC continues to behave like a high-beta, digital macro asset for 2025–26. For ETH, Gupta says, the technicals intersect more directly with fundamentals: On-chain, ETH is gradually turning into infrastructure/“tech equity” plus collateral for rollups, DeFi, and restaking. Structurally that supports a longer-term uptrend even if it underperforms BTC in phases. “From a chart perspective, the important thing is whether ETH can sustain a multi-year pattern of higher highs and higher lows against both USD and BTC. If it does, 2025–26 looks like a consolidation-plus-accumulation phase where ETH behaves like a growth asset leveraged to the broader crypto/app-chain cycle,” he said.

Title: Trump urges Scott Bessent to take Fed chair role, ‘but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury’

For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. ___ Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sells $1.3 billion in BTC as retail panic grows, while institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs climbs to 40% despite market fear. Owen Gunden, one of the richest early Bitcoin holders, has sold his entire Bitcoin position as retail investors flee the market and institutions continue increasing their share of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The wallet tagged as Owen Gunden by blockchain data platform Arkham transferred his last 2,499 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $228 million to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken on Thursday. In total, Gunden’s wallet has sold 11,000 Bitcoin worth around $1.3 billion since Oct. 21, liquidating his entire Bitcoin holdings, according to Arkham. Gunden’s transactions come amid growing concerns over the end of the bull market, with Bitcoin market conditions deteriorating to their “most bearish” level during the current cycle. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has declined to 20/100, or extreme bearish, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows Gunden is the eighth-richest person in crypto, with a net worth of about $561 million according to Arkham’s list of the top crypto millionaires. Gunden was an early Bitcoin arbitrage trader on exchanges like Tradehill and the now-defunct Mt. Gox. He traded 10s of thousands of Bitcoin on the exchange when it was still operational until 2014, building his onchain wealth. Related: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF Meanwhile, the institutional ownership of US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues rising to new highs, despite retail fears over the end of the bull market cycle. The institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs surged to 40% on Wednesday, wrote Bitcoin analyst Root, in an X post. This marks a significant increase from the 27% institutional ownership recorded in the second quarter of 2024, when about 1,119 firms held investments via US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 40% is based on the latest 13-F filings of institutional participants, which is a “conservative estimate” considering that only institutions managing over $100 million are required to file these reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Root said. The growing figures indicate that institutions are holding onto their shares, despite the large-scale selling by ETF shareholders, which has resulted in $2.8 billion in outflows so far in November, according to Farside Investors data.

Title: Exclusive: Former BlackRock employees raise $4.6 million for HelloTrade, a blockchain-powered trading platform
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/former-blackrock-employees-raise-4-6-million/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T13:00:00Z

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street’s major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That’s why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. “We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.” HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren’t easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. HelloTrade’s value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. The startup’s product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade’s co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm’s crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. The two HelloTrade co-founders aren’t the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump’s friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year’s election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It’s an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Private Finance Won’t Save Nature (Blog)

If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. By Mark Opel Nov. 20, 2025 It’s easy to demonstrate the need to fund nature conservation, beyond simply funding the fight against climate change. Wildlife populations have declined 73 percent since 1970, one million species are threatened with extinction, and scientists have determined that the world has crossed seven of nine planetary boundaries. Five of the 10 greatest long-term global risks are environmental, according to the World Economic Forum, with biodiversity loss and ecological collapse ranking second among all risks to the global economy and population. Moreover, funding biodiversity is an investment, not a cost: With over half of global GDP dependent on nature, a transition to a nature-positive economy could actually generate up to $10.1 trillion in annual business value, creating 395 million jobs globally by 2030. Fighting climate change and conserving nature are not in opposition, of course. Nature will be critical to solving the climate crisis: neither biodiversity loss nor climate change will be successfully resolved unless both are tackled together. Yet while nature-based solutions can contribute about one-third of the climate change mitigation needed by 2030, nature receives only 2 percent of total climate funding. Why this disparity? The problem is that we’ve expected private finance to shoulder the burden, and it hasn’t. When I left the world of private equity to apply my finance skills to nature conservation, I had hundreds of conversations with people who used buzzwords and phrases like “innovative finance,” “market-based solutions,” and “impact investing” to describe their goal of uniting profit with conservation. “We just need to build a pipeline of investable projects” was a common refrain, and they made it sound easy to save nature and make money at the same time. When I looked, however, I found that pipeline virtually empty, and it has remained so over the past ten years. Everyone agrees that private finance will be essential to close the nearly $1 trillion annual biodiversity funding gap, but 40 years of generating “innovative finance” and “market-based solutions” have left governments still providing over 80 percent of nature funding. Climate finance is often taken as a model for financing nature conservation, but the economics are fundamentally different. In 2023, private sources provided over $1.2 trillion of climate finance out of a total of $1.9 trillion, representing 66 percent of total climate finance. The share of private finance for climate was over four times the 15 percent share of private finance for nature. The difference is that the private sector can generate attractive financial returns by investing in things like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and efficiency upgrades; these opportunities have led to massive increases in private investments addressing climate change. Similar opportunities to generate revenues and returns simply don’t exist in nature conservation. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. It’s important to remember that attractive climate investment opportunities didn’t happen on their own or through market forces. Governments implemented meaningful policies that make investing in climate solutions profitable and, in some cases, also put in place disincentives that make contributing to climate change costly. For example, in the solar industry, the United States subsidized the research and development that created the first solar panels, China’s industrial policies drove down the costs of manufacturing those panels, and Germany, China, the US, Japan, and other countries all subsidized the adoption of solar that made it attractive for consumers to install. Even now that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, they continue to need government policy support to meet the world’s climate goals. Nature conservation is going to need comparable levels of policy and regulatory support as climate, if it is going to attract private capital at the scale necessary to close the biodiversity funding gap. While there are compelling reasons for the private sector to collectively invest in nature, there is not a compelling business case for any individual business to invest in what will always be, ultimately, a public good. And however much value nature provides (and will be missed if it’s gone), companies and investors have no incentive to internalize their externalities, which will be borne by society but not accounted for on individual financial statements. We can’t blame companies, managers, or investors for this lack of investment; they are incentivized to maximize profits for their shareholders (“You must not expect unnecessary good behavior from capitalists,” as Jeremy Grantham put it). To do otherwise risks your bonus or your job as a manager and, if you are publicly traded, invites an attack on your company (see, for example, Danone) from activist hedge funds (which are also just doing their job in our current system). Being a private company not subject to public market pressures doesn’t change the incentive structure: there are few copycats of Yvon Chouinard’s strategy at Patagonia. We have seen a range of voluntary commitments on climate from large tech companies and groups of banks, but companies inevitably prioritize shareholder returns over voluntary sustainability efforts. We have therefore seen prominent climate goals in the tech sector missed, deforestation pledges fail, and coalitions like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance cease operations. This is a classic example of a market failure that must be addressed through government action. Governments need to recognize biodiversity as the public good that it is, like education and science, public health, infrastructure, and security, the sort of public good that must be funded by governments or incorporated into private investment decision-making through public policy, regulations, and incentives. The private sector is not going to step up and invest in nature voluntarily if it doesn’t increase returns to shareholders in the short term; that’s not how the game is played. However, as Tariq Fancy, former Chief Investment Officer of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock put it, governments can “fix the rules of the game.” Governments can change the rules of the game for the private sector through incentives and regulations, and can also raise funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that can then be used to directly fund investments in nature, each of which is discussed below. “To realize the potential of private sector investment in nature protection and conservation,” as Hank Paulson put it, “governments must put in place policy measures—such as tax breaks, de-risking guarantees, and regulatory requirements—that induce the private sector to invest.” Governments can incentivize the protection and restoration of nature through a variety of mechanisms, including government grants, loans, guarantees and tax incentives that encourage activities that generate positive impacts, or reduce negative impacts, on biodiversity. For example, Costa Rica’s payments for ecosystem services (PES) program pays landowners for the environmental services (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil conservation, and water purification) provided by the conservation and reforestation of their land. Funded by a tax on fossil fuels, the program has helped Costa Rica increase its forest cover from 21 percent in the late 1980s to over 50 percent today. The United States provides tax incentives to encourage private land conservation, which have resulted in the conservation of over 61 million acres of private lands, an area larger than all of the U.S. National Parks combined. A similar program in South Africa has added over one million acres to its protected area network. Government-backed entities like the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, Inter-American Development Bank, and World Bank have provided guarantees that attract private capital in debt-for-nature swaps that generate new long-term funding for nature, totaling $1.7 billion to date. And the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), launched at COP30 in Brazil, is the latest effort to provide incentives for private investment in conservation. The TFFF intends to raise $25 billion of government funding and use that to leverage $100 billion of private funding. Returns from investments of these funds will be used to pay tropical forest for the conservation and restoration of their forests. The government contributions are junior to the private contributions to the fund, de-risking the investment for the private investors. There is also massive potential for governments to shift incentives by redirecting government subsidies away from activities that harm nature toward activities that conserve and restore it. Governments currently provide $2.6 trillion of environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuel, agriculture, forestry, construction, fisheries and other industries, about three times the amount needed to close the biodiversity funding gap, and agreed to reform $500 billion of those subsidies by 2030 in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Governments can require increased private investment in nature by implementing regulations that require changes in private sector activities that impact nature and investments to implement those changes. Examples include the US Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which set limits on pollution of air and water, generated trillions of dollars of private investment and resulted in significant positive impacts on biodiversity and human health. The UK is also instituting a new regulation that requires developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of 10 percent. It is intended to make sure development will result in more or better-quality natural habitat than there was before development. The EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products requires businesses to prove that their products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation. In addition to incentives and regulations, governments can generate funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that they can then use to invest directly in biodiversity. Colombia, for example, has implemented a carbon tax that generates $100 million annually and uses 80 percent of the proceeds to fund investments in nature. The US Land and Water Conservation Fund uses earnings from offshore oil and gas leases to fund state and federal land and water conservation and has provided over $22 billion to date. Botswana’s protected area fees generate $8 million per year. Belize charges a $20 conservation fee to all tourists that directly funds its Protected Area Conservation Trust. The state of Hawaii is assessing a “Green Fee” on tourists that is projected to generate $100 million per year to invest in its natural resources. And my hometown of Boulder, Colorado, was the first city in the nation to implement a tax to conserve land, resulting in the protection of over 45,000 acres (over 70 percent of the city) and helping to make it one of the best cities to live in the country. There are also initiatives underway to develop and implement global levies on things like fossil fuels, aviation, shipping and financial transactions to generate more funds. And governments need to fund nature-related research and development (as they have in renewable energy) in areas such as sustainable agriculture that will help develop new technologies that reduce costs and lead to positive outcomes for biodiversity. Nature is in crisis, and we need fewer “finance experts” and complex voluntary efforts and more focus on generating political will. We need to embrace the irony that to get the private sector investing in nature, we have to first focus on the public sector. Leaders in all sectors who have committed to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Paris Climate Agreement must generate private finance by changing the rules of the game.

Title: Ed Dowd: It Has Begun — Housing, Credit and FCF Have Cracked … Stocks Are Next

What is a Hindenburg Omen? Why does Ed Dowd think that a deflationary event has already begun…one which will shake the world? Tune in to find out… In this podcast, I sit down with Ed Dowd, the former BlackRock portfolio manager, to discuss the AI bubble and how the stock market is entirely being propped up by just 7 companies, most of whom are engaged in what is being termed “circular financing.” That practice hearkens back to the dot.com bubble when companies engaged in what was termed ‘vendor financing.’ In other words, you pay your customers to buy your products. In this era, ‘circular financing’ is vastly more complicated in is workings, but the essence is exactly the same when the maneuvers are boiled away. Ed explained that the math just isn’t mathing. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, needs something like $900 billion of annual subscription revenue at 25% margins just for a 10% ROI. Nope, not going to happen. And certainly not before their first waves of chips wear out and have to be replaced at enormous cost. So, what happens when this bubble bursts? Ed believes that a serious market crash is in the cards. Of course, this means stocks will drop in price, but the main action is going to be in the credit markets. Treasuries will continue to advance in price (fall in yield), making them an attractive option to ride out the storm, while other forms of lesser credit will implode, as is already happening across the subprime lender space (TriColor, PrimaLend, First Brands). When will this happen? According to Ed, it already is. He tracks the Free Cash Flows (FCF) as the more important arbiter of company health and by that metric, all of the Big 7 companies are experiencing declining FCF, while Oracle’s debt is getting more and more expensive to insure against a default. And, oh by the way, stocks are at historically expensive levels, a condition that has historically resulted in very poor returns over the following years: Ed’s view is Deflation first (in housing & credit destruction), which will force the Fed back to QE again, leading to a second inflation wave (energy + money printing). At the same time, Ed views Trump and Bessent’s messaging on the economy as tone-deaf (“Greatest economy ever!”) while the real economy implodes. Ed thinks that a “Hoover scenario” is highly probable, where Trump is remembered for overseeing one of the greatest economic collapses in US history. Given all this, what should a prudent investor do? Tune in to hear Ed’s outlooks… For those who now realize that having a risk-managed approach is more important than ever, please do yourself a favor and schedule a free, no-obligation meeting with Paul Kiker’s team at Kiker Wealth Management to go over your portfolio and strategy.

Title: BlackRock Registers New Staked Ether Trust ETF In Delaware, Eyes SEC Approval

BlackRock is seeking to go beyond simple Ether (ETH) exposure and participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus system. This comes after a recent Delaware filing revealed the $13 trillion asset management giant’s intent to enter the yield-bearing Ethereum market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Nov. 19, as noted by Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Delaware registrations are procedural first steps that have typically preceded formal exchange-traded fund applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933. The next step will involve filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form, depending on the structure of the Ether ETF, to put the product on track for regulatory approval. If approved, the proposed staking fund would complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted nearly $11.5 billion in assets under management since going live on Wall Street in July 2024. In July this year, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to add staking functionality to ETHA, a move that would allow the fund to earn rewards by validating transactions on the Ethereum network. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S. In October, Grayscale secured the greenlight to enable native staking for its U.S. Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) products, becoming the first spot-market funds registered under the Securities Act of 1933 to unlock staking rewards for holders. More recently, REX-Osprey unveiled an ETH staking fund under the less common Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently approved new generic listing standards facilitating quicker approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. BlackRock’s proposed staking-enabled Ethereum ETF could increase its appeal to yield-focused institutional investors who may have avoided ETH investment vehicles due to their lack of income.

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in because markets are moving, and not in small ways. What started as another busy week of earnings and economic data has quickly changed into something more significant. Somewhere between Nvidia’s eye-popping numbers and JPMorgan’s latest call, traders are suddenly talking about an “everything rally,” and even Bitcoin miners are waking up to the buzz. JPMorgan’s trading desk forecasts an “everything rally” after Nvidia exceeded expectations with $57 billion in quarterly revenue and a $65 billion guidance, triggering a 5% after-hours surge and adding over $200 billion to the chipmaker’s market value. Nvidia’s impressive earnings report bolstered belief in the AI investment cycle. Gains spread across chipmakers, and Bitcoin rose above $91,000, with risk appetite returning to markets after a multi-day slide. Nvidia projected an even stronger fourth quarter, guiding revenue to $65 billion versus the $62 billion anticipated by analysts. Nvidia’s upbeat report sparked gains in other chipmakers. AMD, Micron, Broadcom, and Intel all climbed in after-hours trading, reflecting optimism for the semiconductor sector. The results reinforced investor confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track despite recent volatility. After the S&P 500 Index fell 3.4% over four days, JPMorgan’s trading desk issued a bullish note. Andrew Tyler reiterated a dip-buying stance, emphasizing stable fundamentals and stating the investment thesis is not reliant on Federal Reserve policy shifts. The bank highlighted Nvidia earnings and the September nonfarm payrolls report as major catalysts for potential new market highs. SETUP POISED FOR AN "EVERYTHING RALLY"JPMORGAN TRADING DESK:"Given that there have not been any changes to the fundamental story, nor does our investment hypothesis rely on the Fed easing, we are dip-buyers. As we look at the two key events this week, (i) Sept's NFP and (ii)… Goldman Sachs mirrored JPMorgan’s optimism. Partner John Flood described the recent market drop as a “real buying opportunity” ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, anticipating a year-end rally. The investment bank stated that hedge funds have de-risked, while discretionary investors remain underweight and are poised to deploy capital. November has been the S&P 500’s weakest month since 2008, with a 3% decline month-to-date. Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher Mining, IREN, and Hut 8 leapt in pre-market trading after Nvidia’s strong guidance. The surge reflected growing acknowledgment of miners’ expanding role in AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. Nonetheless, institutional investors, including Peter Thiel and SoftBank, have recently trimmed their holdings in Nvidia and major AI companies, signaling wariness over high valuations. Peter Thiel reportedly sold his entire position of 537,742 shares in Nivdia.Why? It’s a bubble, they all know it & are cashing out. – Nvidia ALONE = 15% of US GDP.-OpenAi wants a govt bailout. – US Growth is .01% when you remove AI sector. pic.twitter.com/mk3Nc6yBpk A Bank of America survey revealed that 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the primary threat to markets. Global regulators, including the Bank of England and the IMF, warn of risks from potential AI and crypto bubbles. Amidst strong market enthusiasm, investor Michael Burry raised concerns regarding Nvidia’s stock-based compensation. Burry examined financial data since 2018, highlighting a gap between reported earnings and true value creation for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2018, NVDA earned about $205B net income and $188B free cash flow, assuming all cap ex was growth cap ex.SBC amounted to $20.5B.But it bought back $112.5B worth of stock and there are 47 million MORE shares outstanding.The true cost of that SBC dilution… pic.twitter.com/u8VhZyokrB Burry’s analysis suggests stock-based compensation has masked Nvidia’s real earnings strength. The company posted $205 billion in net income and $188 billion in free cash flow since 2018. Despite this, its share count rose by 47 million, even after $112.5 billion in repurchases. The dynamic raises questions about whether headline numbers fully reflect value for shareholders. This debate captures ongoing tensions in market sentiment. While JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs highlight strong fundamentals and structural AI demand, skeptics point to valuation risks and possible headwinds. As investors digest Nvidia’s results and changing economic data, the coming weeks will reveal whether the “everything rally” expectation comes true or volatility persists.

Title: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF

BitMine’s $3.7 billion paper loss and the falling mNAV valuations are threatening the business model of DATs, according to 10x Research. Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether (ETH) holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows The mNAV ratio compares a company’s enterprise value to the value of its crypto holdings. An mNAV above 1 allows a company to raise funds by issuing new shares to accumulate digital assets. Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. BitMine’s basic mNAV stood at 0.77 while its diluted mNAV stood at 0.92, according to data from Bitminetracker. BitMine holds about 3.56 million ETH valued at roughly $10.7 billion, representing 2.94% of the total Ether supply. The firm’s average cost basis is $4,051 per ETH. Other DATs also suffered a sharp decrease in their mNAVs, including Strategy, Bitmine, Metaplanet, Sharplink Gaming, Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. Related: Strategy rides out Bitcoin crash, still on track for S&P 500 spot: Matrixport BlackRock has registered a new staked Ether ETF offering in Delaware, marking the first step for the $13.5 trillion asset management giant’s diversification into Ethereum-based products, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. BlackRock’s proposed Ether staking ETF could offer another low-cost, yield-generating fund, without the hidden costs associated with traditional treasury firms. This development may threaten the economics of DATs, according to 10x Research. “With BlackRock now seeking approval to stake ETH in its ETF, offering a low-cost source of yield, the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny,” the research report states. More investors may start reallocating toward a potential staked Ether fund from BlackRock when they realize that the 0.25% management fee is far smaller compared to the embedded costs of DATs, according to 10X. Asset managers REX-Osprey and Grayscale have already launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October.

Title: The Dam United - Netherland's powerhouse seek history
URL: https://www.rte.ie/sport/hurling/2025/1120/1544933-the-dam-united-netherlands-powerhouse-seek-history/

RTÉ Sport journalist Ice baths have become common place in the routine of a GAA player before and after a big match, but 30-odd Amsterdam hurlers might be taking it to the extreme as they get set to leap into the Herengracht Canal ahead of the biggest ever game for the club – a Leinster Special Club Junior final against Longford Slashers on Saturday. On 17 March, 2003, as Gary Hanniffy was lifting the Tommy Moore Cup as Birr defeated Dunloy in the All-Ireland final, seeds were being sown 750km east as the Amsterdam GAA club was formed on a chilly St Patrick's Day in the Netherlands. History was made at Croke Park that day as Birr became the first four-time All-Ireland winners, moving clear of Cork’s Blackrock and Galway’s Athenry, and 22 years later it’s Amsterdam who have made a bit of history by becoming the first mainland European team to reach a Leinster final. The special club tournament – essentially a Junior B grade – was first run in 2007 and won by Offaly’s Kullrin, before their amalgamation with Killeigh to form Clodiagh Gaels, and the prize on offer, by coincidence, was a trip to the Netherlands with a match scheduled against a European selection in the Hague. It ran until 2015 before being placed on hiatus until its return this year - and this weekend, a crowd of club members will gather in Mulligan’s Irish Bar in the Dutch city to watch the final while for the second time in a number of weeks, the panel will make the trip to Ireland. Earlier this month, the side travelled to Ashbourne and faced Meath IHC finalists Rathmolyon. Five points down at the break, and four behind with just 10 minutes left, the four-in-a-row European champions fought back down the stretch and fittingly it was Galway’s Grahame McDermott who moved them ahead for only the second time in the contest with a penalty in the 63rd minute with their player-manager, Limerick’s Dara O’Farrell, putting the seal on a famous 1-13 to 1-11 win. They’re off to Glennon Brothers Pearse Park for the final against Robbie Stakelum’s Slashers, who won their county’s senior title this year with a win over Wolfe Tone's and defeated Wicklow’s Aughrim in the other Leinster semi-final. With history already made, the hope is they can add some more, but whatever the outcome, it’s going to be a day to remember for club chairperson Eimear Lafferty. A member of the famed Gormley clan in Tyrone – her aunt Eilish is one of the best ladies players in Ulster history - Lafferty was always likely to find her way to the GAA club when landing in 'Mokum’ four years ago. It only took hours in the end, the player heading to training on the very same evening she arrived. She still plays with them, helps with the management too and, of course, chairs a committee that is completely player-led. "We’re a long-established club, but we seem to be growing year-on-year," said Lafferty. "For a number of years, the ladies' team was an amalgamation of teams from the Benelux region (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) but we’re lucky enough now to have the numbers for our own team. "We’re quite lucky with our facilities, it’s outside the city but with the bike culture, we can all cycle there – it's about a 45-minute cycle each way for me. "The biggest challenge for us is that we are an entirely player-run club. A lot of the European clubs don’t have that older generation to turn to who did a lot of that managing in terms of the logistics of the club. "It is difficult to separate those roles when you’re still a player, but we’ve worked really hard on it. "In the last couple of years we have established a camogie team and they won their first tournament this year, we’re building our youth team – we hosted Cúl Camps last year and the European Féile this year – and we’ve also set up a handball team this year; I suppose you could call us a fully-fledged GAA club for the first time. "It’s certainly given myself and the committee members a deeper appreciation of all the work our Irish clubs carry out to keep us playing and invested in the sport we grew up with - particularly my home club, Aodh Ruadh, now Thomas Clarke’s, which was founded by inspirational and dedicated women of the GAA that had to push and campaign to have their voices heard, and to become a successful club." Two trips to Ireland in a fortnight is what the club wanted, but it brings with it a serious financial burden. That’s where the dip in the canal comes in with a Go Fund Me campaign promising a series of forfeits for each milestone met, with players set to shave heads, perform a song in the middle of Dam Square and – for a target long since reached – jump as a group into water in their full club kit. The city is set for a temperature high of 6 degrees this week, according to forecasts, so it’s cash well earned. "It’ll cost about €500, €600 to send each player over to Ireland and we have a panel of 30," Lafferty continued. "We’re lucky the lads are happy to do all these challenges. There’s maybe a few girlfriends unhappy with all these shaved heads and shaved moustaches, but we’re very good at pulling together as a club. "You can take being player-run as a negative as there is that extra pressure, but it does mean that everyone who is involved is really dedicated and wants to see the club flourish and thrive." It's an all-Irish squad travelling to Longford, although the club has - and continues to - attract players from both the Netherlands and a number of nations. 'Big' Thom Verweijen has played a key role in midfield at times for the hurler while the club's female teams in particular attract players from various nations. It adds another layer of pride for all involved with the club. That pride will be on display at Pearse Park. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Can We Blame Private Equity for Everything?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Did PE firms make the world worse? Or was it something else? The Blackstone Group offices in New York, 2013. The 2010s were, among other things, the decade of private equity. A segment of the finance sector long shrouded in myth and controversy, private equity is at its core a straightforward business: A firm raises money from clients (such as pension funds) and uses it to buy businesses and other assets (such as real estate), usually adding a large chunk of borrowed money to the mix. The PE firm aims to increase the value of the acquired assets and then sell them at a profit. Clients receive whatever is left of any gains after the deduction of fees, which include a share of those gains. The “equity” in private equity refers to the ownership stakes the PE firm takes, while the “private” means these investments are held outside of public stock markets. Though private equity has been around since the 1970s, its growth went into overdrive after the global financial crisis of 2007–09. Until that point, banks—especially investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan—had been the most powerful players in the world of global finance. Yet banks were widely held responsible for the crisis, leading regulators in the United States and a host of other countries to clip their wings. As big banks became “more heavily regulated and scrutinized,” Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2019, private-equity firms like Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR moved decisively out of their shadow. “Almost everything that’s happened since 2008 has tilted in [private equity’s] favor. Low interest rates to finance deals? Check. A friendly political climate? Check. A long line of clients? Check…. Private equity managers,” the Bloomberg Businessweek report concluded, “won the financial crisis.” By 2021, the average Blackstone employee was earning more than $2 million per annum, and the firm’s CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, had a net worth of nearly $40 billion. It is thus little wonder that recent years have seen a slew of books aimed at coming to grips with the PE phenomenon, with more in the works. The latest addition to the crop is Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream, by the journalist Megan Greenwell. Although there have been notable exceptions—including two memoirs about working in private equity, from very different perspectives—most of the recent books, as Greenwell points out, have been attempts to understand and evaluate PE in broad terms as an economic and social phenomenon: what it is, how it operates, its size and structure, and so forth. Such books focus, Greenwell observes, “on the macro level: the number of companies that shutter, the number of jobs that disappear, the number of dollars that are won and lost.” In Bad Company, Greenwell takes a different tack, shifting the lens from the macro to the micro level. “When we talk about how private equity affects communities,” she writes, “we’re really talking about how it affects people, the individuals who have no choice but to rely on firms for their jobs, their homes, their essential services.” And so she presents us with the stories of four individuals whose lives have been impacted by the PE takeover of, respectively, a retail chain, a small-town hospital, a newspaper company, and an apartment complex. Through these profiles, Greenwell paints a picture of a decidedly unedifying phenomenon: of PE firms swooping into local communities, buying local assets, and radically degrading the conditions of people’s lives. But does this analytical shift from the macro to the micro scale ultimately pay dividends for our understanding of the nature and effects of the PE business? There are, of course, always different ways to tell a story, and the story of private equity is no different in this respect. However, when the mode of analysis is the exploration of individual lives, as it is in Bad Company, it’s important to think closely about what those lives can and cannot meaningfully tell us about the wider phenomenon under consideration. When books that explore broad social phenomena through individuals’ life stories work particularly well, there is usually an intimate and necessary connection between the lives in question and the phenomenon to which the author is relating them. The sociologist Matthew Desmond’s 2016 book Evicted is a good example. In it, Desmond follows eight individuals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they and their households go through the process of eviction at the hands of their landlords. Focused on these individual lives, Evicted also manages to serve as an exemplary study of the wider phenomenon of eviction because of two key characteristics of the latter. The first is that eviction is precisely something that happens to individuals. The second is that, for tenants, involuntary eviction is a unique hardship: While housing insecurity can take many forms and can be suffered in all sorts of ways, nothing else matches the experience of being evicted from one’s home against one’s wishes. Then what about working for a company or living in an apartment that is taken over by a PE firm? Is that, too, a unique type of experience? Consider Greenwell’s four profiles: Liz is laid off without severance from Toys “R” Us when its PE owners close its last 200 stores; Roger, a doctor, sees his beloved hospital in rural Wyoming stripped of resources and crucial services after a PE takeover; Natalia is a reporter at a local newspaper whose staff is slashed after PE ownership takes hold, diminishing the paper’s capacity to report and hence the community’s access to local news; and Loren moves from public rental housing into a PE-owned apartment complex where mold and infestations of mice and roaches are not allowed to stand in the way of rent hikes. Is there a necessary and intimate connection between these types of personal experience and the phenomenon of private equity, one that makes them “PE experiences” per se? Greenwell maintains that there is indeed such a necessary and intimate connection. For her, the experience of working at a PE-owned business or living in PE-owned housing is special inasmuch as the PE ownership and operation of such assets is itself special. As she sees it, it all comes down to profitability—that is, what ostensibly connects the individuals whose lives Greenwell chronicles, thus making theirs a shared experience as opposed to four unrelated ordeals, is their subjection to a distinctive profit calculus. But is that calculus unique to PE? Early in Bad Company, Greenwell cites the American economist Milton Friedman and his influential 1970 essay about the role of the corporation in American capitalism. “The social responsibility of business,” Friedman famously insisted, “is to increase its profits.” And that, he added, is its sole responsibility. Friedman’s injunction has been endlessly debated in the decades since. For Greenwell, its particular relevance is that private equity, and only private equity, has, in her view, followed the Friedmanite philosophy to the letter. Friedman, she says, “set the stage for the rise of private equity.” To explain how PE differs from other forms of owning and operating assets like businesses and real estate, Greenwell offers the following take: “The definition of success is loftier in the private equity world: not just making profits, but maximizing them.” “Merely making a profit was no longer enough,” she writes, for instance, of what changed when Apollo Global Management took over LifePoint Health and its chain of rural hospitals across the US, including Roger’s hospital in Wyoming. “Now the goal,” à la Friedman, “was to maximize shareholder value.” In positing this Manichaean distinction between “normal” capitalist businesses that “just make” profits and PE firms that seek to “maximize” them, Greenwell establishes a pro forma narrative of what happens when private equity comes to town: “When the only worth of a local grocery store, a newspaper, or a hospital is the short-term profits it can generate, the company becomes little more than a mine awaiting extraction.” Which, crucially, is not what that company had previously been: “Businesses that were once pillars of a society founder and crumble,” Greenwell writes. By this way of thinking, other capitalist businesses, unlike PE firms, do take seriously “responsibilities” other than profit-making. Far be it from me to downplay private equity’s profiteering, but this argument clearly rests on a questionable supposition: Is it genuinely credible to cast non-PE firms as less obsessed with profit? Try telling BlackRock, State Street, or the other major shareholders in America’s 4,000-odd public companies that the goal of those companies is something besides maximizing shareholder value. Greenwell’s own reporting demonstrably belies the distinction her book posits. Take Gannett, the media group that owned the local newspaper employing Natalia when it was acquired by Fortress Investment Group in 2019. Was Gannett formerly a pillar of local society, whose modus operandi was rudely upended by the PE barbarians? Hardly. “Well before private equity was in the local media game,” Greenwell informs us, “Gannett was creating [PE] firms’ playbooks for them: ruthlessly consolidate, centralize as much as possible, boost shareholder value at all costs—even when the cost was the journalism, the company’s ostensible raison d’être.” Gannett, it turns out, was already an archetype of Friedmanite capitalism, red in tooth and claw. The same kind of contradiction befalls the other case studies here. The more Greenwell tells us about the businesses that private equity came in and subsumed, the less like pillars of society and paragons of business ethics they appear to be. Rather than substantiating her thesis of a sui generis role for private equity in destroying civil society and the American dream, what Greenwell actually reaffirms is a kind of bog-standard point about how business is done in America. Because, of course, it wasn’t just private equity that took Friedman’s gospel to heart. Capital at large did. None of this is to say that there aren’t important differences between PE firms and other owners and managers of businesses and real estate—that things do not change when PE comes to town. Very often they do. Nor is it to say that the individual stories that Greenwell spotlights in Bad Company have nothing to tell us about the corrosive effects of a corporate and financial world single-mindedly beholden to maximizing shareholder value. But as insights, in and of themselves, into the nature of the PE phenomenon? Not so much. In reality, much the same book, containing much the same litany of woes, could be written about the effects on individuals and communities of adventures in the capitalist profit imperative that have nothing to do with private equity whatsoever. Indeed, over the years, many such books already have been written, from Michael Harrington’s The Other America to Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed and Jefferson Cowie’s Stayin’ Alive. Does a private-equity takeover often result in dire outcomes for workers and tenants? To be sure. But it is far from being unique in that. It’s for good reason that the other recent books seeking to comprehend and appraise the PE phenomenon are primarily pitched at the macro level. Private equity is a quintessentially macro-scale enterprise; instructive analysis of it cannot eschew that analytical scale. Boiled down to its essence, private equity is an investment phenomenon. Yet if investment is the term we use to refer to the myriad ways in which actors holding surplus capital are connected to the actors who put that capital to work, then private equity represents above all a distinctive way of configuring that connectivity. Arguably, its cardinal characteristic—evident to all institutional stakeholders—is that the investment explicitly does not have an open time horizon. Allocating client capital via funds with fixed lifespans, and returning the capital (ideally with a profit) to clients upon the funds’ termination, PE managers buy assets—and this cannot be emphasized enough—in order to later sell them. Whether the acquired businesses or rental homes or whatever else it may be are held for one year, three, or five, everything that the PE manager does with those assets while they are under its control is done with a view specifically to maximize the price at exit. If there is a single thing that one must grasp in order to understand private equity, this is it. Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers John Nichols Column / Chris Lehmann Sasha Abramsky Bad Company, to be clear, does not eschew macro-scale analysis altogether. Greenwell has plenty to say about the role of debt financing in PE buyouts; the relationship of PE firms to their clients in the institutional-investor community; the significance of PE tax breaks, which generations of policymakers have refused to abolish; and much else besides. Ultimately, it’s a question of balance. The examination of how a handful of individuals experience life at the sharp end of private equity’s pillaging can, without doubt, add texture and color to our understanding, helping to humanize the impacts of an industry often discussed in dry financial terms. But it’s questionable whether it can do more than that, not least because those experiences are not categorically different from the experiences of individuals ensnared by capitalist ravages more generally. Private equity, to my mind at least, has always internalized a fundamental tension concerning its ability to exit its investments, which is typically achieved either through a sale to another private buyer (whether a strategic trade buyer or another financial investor) or through an IPO on the stock market. Why, one wonders, are other investors willing to pay the top-dollar exit price that private equity, by its very nature, demands? If—as is generally assumed to be the case—the PE firm has itself exhausted all the obvious opportunities for value enhancement and extraction during its period of ownership, why buy what’s left? If all the fruit has been plucked and the PE firm has achieved its signature goal of exiting at maximum value, is not the only way for the subsequent value of those assets, in fact, down? Over the past couple of years, it seems that the penny may have finally dropped. PE firms are widely struggling to exit their investments profitably and return cash to their clients. In mounting desperation, they have turned to launching so-called “continuation vehicles”—essentially, mechanisms for extending fund life and protecting the book value of marginal assets—but clients, smelling a rat, have been reluctant to back them. A vicious circle seems to be setting in: Required to hold on to assets for longer and longer periods, private equity is, as the financial journalist Katie Martin observes, “squeezing more of the juice out of them, and leaving little for public market investors,” thereby making it even harder still to achieve an exit. The upshot is that the PE sector is now sitting on some $3 trillion worth of unsellable assets. And as clients have become increasingly frustrated with the difficulties of achieving and realizing gains from PE investments, they have responded by beginning to allocate less capital to the sector. Private-equity fundraising slid to a seven-year low in the last year, and with a record number of firms chasing this dwindling pot of capital, many have resorted to “unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash,” not least markedly lower fees. No wonder that PE firms have meanwhile been lobbying furiously for access to new sources of capital, with America’s individual retirement savings—hitherto off-limits for PE managers—considered the holy grail, and President Trump seemingly willing to oblige. In short, the PE sector, and its profitability prospects, are under pressure as perhaps never before, making it possible to ask a question that until recently would have been deemed outlandish: Has private equity had its moment in the sun?

Title: Bitcoin just hit a critical point: analysts split between $85K crash and $250K surge

While Bitcoin price has recovered from the low of $88,540 hit on November 19, the question is whether it will hit a higher high than the $93,403 registered on November 18. Some analysts believe BTC is preparing for a deeper slide, while others insist a powerful rebound is already forming beneath the surface. At press time, BTC price was around $92,237 and already showing signs of exhaustion, which would spell doom since it formed a lower low on November 19, which is a bearish sign. At $92,237, Bitcoin (BTC) is reeling from a bruising stretch that has erased more than $33,000 from its value in under two months. Notably, today’s uptick follows a pause in ETF outflows and a rebound in tech stocks, driven by Nvidia’s stronger-than-expected earnings. While the market remains on edge as macro uncertainty and shifting liquidity conditions continue to pressure risk assets, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson remains one of the strongest voices calling for a major rebound. During CNBC’s Squawk Box show on Tuesday, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s recent losses reflect broader macro distortions, including tariff tensions, recession risks, and uneven regulatory signals. Hoskinson believes these forces will ease in the coming months. He expects BTC to recover sharply and potentially hit $250,000 within the next year, projecting that institutional adoption and large-scale tokenisation will redefine market cycles. Michael Saylor shares a similar level of confidence, viewing the current downturn as typical of Bitcoin’s long-term behaviour. The MicroStrategy executive says the company is built to withstand extreme drawdowns, calling his position “indestructible” in a recent interview with Fox Business. ₿etter than Ever. Today I was the warm-up act for @natbrunell as we both talked Bitcoin with @cvpayne. You’ll want to hear what she had to say. pic.twitter.com/vDaFceyeza — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 18, 2025 Notably, Saylor has continued to buy BTC even as volatility increases, reinforcing his view that deep corrections are part of the broader path toward higher valuations. ETF activity has also become a pivotal factor. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF posted a record $523 million daily loss on November 18 following a streak of outflows across the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. The Bitcoin ETFs outflow seems to have stabilised, with IBIT seeing $60M worth of inflows on November 19. Analysts warn that sustained inflows will be essential if Bitcoin hopes to avoid a retest of this week’s lows. Not all signals point upward. Some traders see a real chance BTC could break below key support levels near $90,000. If the market fails to hold this support, prediction platforms indicate rising expectations of a drop toward $87,000. ETF outflows totalling more than $3 billion this month highlight lingering caution, and many retail participants remain hesitant after weeks of drawdowns. Macro conditions remain complicated. Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have faded, while recession concerns are resurfacing due to weak jobs data and ongoing trade friction. These pressures have limited upside momentum even as Nvidia’s tech rally briefly boosted risk appetite. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to trade like a high-beta asset tied closely to broader market sentiment, and the next few days may determine whether buyers regain control or whether sellers will test new lows.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Nearly two years after the inception of the Bitcoin ETF sector in the United States, these funds are currently grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by mounting concerns regarding a potential bear market in the coming months. This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum staking plans with new Delaware trust

Time Published: 2025-11-20T07:55:09Z

BlackRock has taken another step toward a staking-focused Ethereum ETF by setting up a new statutory trust in Delaware, signalling fresh movement in the fast-growing market for yield-generating crypto products. The trust, called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, was officially formed on Nov. 19, according to state records. While the filing does not include product documents, it adds to a broader industry shift toward staking features within regulated ETFs. The move positions BlackRock to explore yield-bearing structures as competitors such as Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey advance their own staking plans across major digital asset funds. The new trust was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires full disclosures before any product reaches investors. This registration serves as a preliminary step rather than a full submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. To move forward, BlackRock would still need to file a Form S-1, but the firm has not provided a timeline. Delaware continues to be a popular state for early-stage ETF setup because of its regulatory structure, and BlackRock has often used the same route when preparing digital asset products. The trust now sits alongside ETHA, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF that launched in July 2024. ETHA has attracted more than $13 billion in inflows and currently does not stake its holdings. Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 in July 2025 to allow ETHA to stake ETH with approved validators. If approved, that update would introduce staking rewards while also requiring detailed disclosures about custody arrangements, slashing risks, validator selection, and the handling of locked ETH. Staking rewards on Ethereum generally range between 3% and 5% each year, and issuers must explain how they will track, calculate, and distribute those rewards. BlackRock’s move comes as the broader ETF market accelerates toward staking-enabled products. Grayscale received approval in October 2025 to introduce staking within ETHE and its Mini Trust ETF, making them the first Ethereum funds under the 1933 Act permitted to earn staking rewards. Other issuers, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey, have also submitted similar filings. REX-Osprey already operates a staked Solana ETF and launched a staked Ethereum version in September. BlackRock’s digital assets head Robert Mitchnick said staking features across ETFs could attract between $10 and $20 billion by mid-2026. Experts now expect the next catalyst to be BlackRock’s potential S-1 submission, which would move the new trust closer to becoming a yield-bearing Ethereum ETF. ETF analysts say expanding staking options could lock a significant amount of ETH within regulated products, influencing liquidity and long-term supply. The combination of new filings, updated fund structures, and rising capital inflows has set up a competitive race among issuers. BlackRock’s new trust adds another step in that process, signalling how institutional demand for Ethereum staking continues to reshape the ETF landscape.

BlackRock has now joined the race to launch a staked ether ETF, registering the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware on Nov. 19, according to a state filing highlighted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. The registration is only an initial step and not yet a formal application under the Securities Act of 1933, but it signals that the world’s largest asset manager is preparing to seek approval for a yield-bearing ether product. BlackRock's move comes weeks after VanEck registered a similar trust tied to Lido’s staked ETH, positioning issuers for the next phase of competition once regulators give clarity on whether staking can be included in U.S. ETFs. The first wave of spot ETH ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC told issuers to strip the feature, citing its view that certain staking services could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

Title: 1 in 3 young investors switched advisers over crypto access: Survey

Time Published: 2025-11-20T05:30:20Z

Young and rich investors want wealth advisers to offer crypto, and some have moved their money from those who don’t, according to a survey by Zerohash. Money managers may need to rethink their approach to digital assets, with over a third of young, wealthy investors in a recent US survey indicating they had moved on from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Crypto payments provider Zerohash’s survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40, released on Wednesday, found that 35% had moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer access to crypto. Those surveyed had incomes between $100,000 and $1 million, and more than half of those who moved money due to an advisers lack of crypto offerings said they had moved between $250,000 and $1 million. Crypto has only recently enjoyed an ultra-friendly policy environment in the US, and some wealth advisers are still playing catch-up as younger investors are less risk-averse compared to past generations. Zerohash said that over four-fifths of those surveyed said their confidence in crypto was boosted due to its adoption by major finance institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. Zerohash found that respondents with incomes of $500,000 and up were “leading the exodus,” with half having moved from advisers over crypto access. The survey also found 84% of all respondents planned to increase their crypto holdings in the next year, with nearly half saying they would “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the findings show that crypto “has become essential to modern portfolio strategy” and many wealthy investors “are not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up.” “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” they said. Related: US government reopening may unleash crypto ETF floodgates: Analyst They added that investors were clear with their expectations and wanted “insured, compliant crypto access.” Zerohash said based on its survey results, its playbook for advisers to win investors is to offer crypto on “the same dashboard as traditional assets” with insured custody. “Investors expect more than Bitcoin and Ethereum,” it added. “Ninety-two percent say access to a broader range of digital assets is important.” Meanwhile, asset managers have begun offering exchange-traded products with exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, with products tied to altcoins including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE). More novel products have featured staking, which rewards users for locking up tokens to secure a blockchain. Major issuer BlackRock is also seemingly set to offer staking exposure, filing for a staked Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund in Delaware on Wednesday.
