Title: Truth Social owner Trump Media becomes first company listed on NYSE Texas — handing early win to exchange

Trump Media & Technology Group said on Monday it has become the first company to be listed on NYSE Texas, handing an early boost to the exchange as it gears up for fierce competition in the Lone Star state. The company, which operates Truth Social and is primarily owned by President Trump, said it will also list its warrants on the Texas exchange. Its primary listing, however, will remain on the Nasdaq. The move could bolster Intercontinental Exchange-owned NYSE, which on Monday became the first exchange to operate in Texas. The state is home to the largest number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with a combined market value of over $3.7 trillion, and is now seeing rising competition for market dominance among stock exchanges. NYSE will have to contend with rival Nasdaq, which promised to open a regional headquarters in the state earlier this month, and the Texas Stock Exchange, a venture backed by heavyweights including BlackRock and Citadel Securities. The Texas Stock Exchange submitted paperwork in January to operate as a national securities exchange, and is eyeing a launch in 2026. “This listing, alongside our plans to reincorporate in Florida, shows we’re part of a growing movement to take our business to states that value free enterprise and personal freedom,” said Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes. Trump Media is a popular stock on retail trading forums and has often seen wild bouts of volatility in the past, such as around the election in November. Securing the listing is a major win for the NYSE, but some consider the move “symbolic” – a perception that the exchange will likely need to change, while also strengthening liquidity. Still, the growing competition between listing venues could strengthen the state’s emergence as a financial hub and a challenger to New York. “The Texas business-friendly environment — lack of all the political issues and a stronger focus on what business should be — has a really unique position,” said Derek Wilson, co-founder of Dallas Opportunity Partners, an investor in the Texas Stock Exchange. The announcement came on the heels of a filing late on Friday that BlackRock’s iShares division has filed for SEC approval to launch a Texas-focused exchange traded fund. The asset management giant did not disclose the exchange on which it proposes to list the ETF. The fund will invest in stocks of companies headquartered in Texas that make up the Russell Texas Equity Index, a subset of the Russell 3000 index Unless regulators block or delay the offering, it could begin trading by early June.

Title: BlackRock CEO warns US dollar could lose global reserve status to Bitcoin

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink issued a stark warning in his 2025 annual letter to investors, saying that the United States risks losing its global reserve currency status to Bitcoin. “If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if the deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote in his 2025 annual letter to investors. His comments come as BlackRock’s own actions echo this conviction. Since launching its spot Bitcoin ETF, the asset manager has accumulated over 575,000 BTC, cementing its position as both the largest asset manager and the largest holder of Bitcoin in the ETF space. Fink’s remarks and the firm’s Bitcoin strategy signal that BlackRock views Bitcoin as the dominant digital asset class poised to lead the financial future. Although he emphasized his support for digital innovation, he warned that the same technology could erode America’s edge if investors begin viewing Bitcoin as a safer alternative to the dollar. Recent developments have underscored the urgency of Fink’s warning. Earlier this month, Moody’s downgraded its outlook on US debt to negative, citing rising concerns over former President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs and unfunded tax cuts. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Policy Center has projected that the US could default on its obligations as early as July if Congress fails to intervene. Fink’s warning on US debt came alongside an optimistic outlook on innovation. He described tokenization as one of the most transformative shifts in modern finance. Arguing that converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens would revolutionize investing by enabling instant settlement, democratized access, and better yields. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” he wrote. “If they are, it will revolutionize investing.” The key challenge, he said, is identity verification, which remains a technical and regulatory bottleneck for tokenized markets. Fink cited India’s Aadhaar system as a potential model for the digital financial infrastructure needed to scale such solutions globally. Despite the anxiety voiced by clients and leaders worldwide, Fink expressed long-term optimism in capital markets, calling them one of the most powerful human systems ever created. Yet even that system, he warned, may not be enough to preserve US dominance if Washington fails to get its fiscal house in order. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Issues US Dollar Warning, Says Greenback at Risk of Losing World Reserve Status to Bitcoin

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that the US dollar may be losing its reserve status to Bitcoin (BTC). In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened – not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” BlackRock heavily invested in Bitcoin in 2024 with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which would ultimately become the most successful exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch of all time. Fink, who oversees $11.5 trillion in assets at BlackRock, notes how the world’s financial system runs on “plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,” opening the door for smoother, faster technology like blockchain-based tokenization. The CEO says, “If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself.” “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Blackdog1966/Andy Chipus Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: BlackRock CEO: 'Protectionism Has Returned With Force'

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink didn't mention President Trump by name in his widely read letter to shareholders in the world's largest asset manager—but days ahead of the rollout of Trump's latest tariffs, he noted that "protectionism has returned with force." "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," Fink wrote. "I understand why. But we have lived through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we figure things out." Treading cautiously. Fink "treads cautiously" in the influential letter this year, Axios notes. In previous years, calls for BlackRock to do more to tackle climate change and improve workplace diversity led to a backlash from Republicans, reports Reuters. But with the rollback of diversity policies and a deal to buy Panama Canal ports from a Hong Kong-based company, the firm is back in the GOP's good books. "Not everyone has shared in this wealth." Fink said more people are investing in the US stock market, "but not everyone has shared in this wealth," the Financial Times reports. He said that while globalization lifted a billion people around the world out of poverty, "it also held back millions in wealthier nations striving for a better life." "The unspoken assumption is that capitalism didn't work and it's time to try something new," he wrote. "But there's another way to look at it: Capitalism did work—just for too few people." Leveling the playing field. Fink, whose firm oversees more than $11 trillion in assets, called for the "democratization" of investing, saying individuals should have greater access to the private assets that have delivered large returns to big investors like pension funds, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Assets that will define the future—data centers, ports, power grids, the world's fastest-growing private companies—aren't available to most investors," he wrote. "They're in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants." The full letter, which touches on subjects including bitcoin, nuclear power, and artificial intelligence, can be seen here. (More Larry Fink stories.)

Title: China blocks $23B sale of Panama Canal ports to US-backed consortium led by BlackRock
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/31/business/china-blocks-23b-sale-of-panama-canal-ports-to-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-03-31T17:04:06Z
Full Content:
China has held up the $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide — including two key ports in the Panama Canal — to a group led by US investing giant BlackRock after President Trump expressed concern about Beijing’s sway over the strategic shipping lanes. On March 4, CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. China President Xi Jinping is reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s plans to sell its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand, according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal — spearheaded by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a longtime Trump confidante — called for an agreement to be signed by April 2, though it now is likely that the Wednesday deadline will be missed. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told The Post. Insiders say Chinese leadership had hoped to leverage the port issue in its talks with the Trump administration, only to be caught off guard by the deal’s sudden progress. Trump hailed the development as a strategic win over China — casting Panama as a key battleground in the broader US-China struggle for global influence. In response, an op-ed published in the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao condemned the sale as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” The timing of the deal’s announcement, coming just before the start of the “two sessions,” China’s most significant annual political and economic gathering, only deepened the offense for Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. The Panama Canal — used extensively by both the US and China — has reemerged as a flashpoint in global politics after President Trump renewed his pledge to assert American dominance over the waterway. Beijing’s move to influence the affairs of CK Hutchison reinforced concerns among global observers about China’s diminishing distinction between private and public sectors as well as its aggressive encroachment into Hong Kong’s affairs. Trump has claimed that the canal is controlled by China and operated by its military. In reality, CK Hutchison, the company at the heart of the port sale, is headquartered in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region historically afforded a high degree of operational independence from Beijing. The dispute over the canal’s ports arises at a sensitive moment as China faces ongoing tensions from a US trade war. This week, Trump is expected to announce a new round of so-called “reciprocal tariffs.” Advertisement

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo (Bloomberg) — President Xi Jinping is seeking to paint China as a steady partner to investors roiled by a global trade war. A spat over a shipping lane coveted by Donald Trump is testing that push. Hours after Xi pledged at a meeting with global executives in Beijing on Friday to create a “predictable” business environment, China’s market regulator said it would open a review into billionaire Li Ka-shing’s deal to sell 43 ports around the world, including two in the Panama Canal, citing the need to “protect public interests.” Over the weekend, Chinese officials overseeing Hong Kong affairs shared articles on social media accusing CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of acting “in concert with US hegemony” over the $22.8 billion sale. Those broadsides came after the US president framed the prospective deal to a group featuring BlackRock Inc. as America “reclaiming” the famed waterway. Beijing’s attempts to influence the operations of a private firm in Latin America risk undercutting Xi’s bid to bolster confidence in the world’s No. 2 economy, where foreign investment last year fell to the lowest level in decades. Derailing the deal could also give credence to the US leaders’ claims CK Hutchison is ultimately controlled by the Communist Party — a perception with implications for private Chinese companies worldwide. “This flies in the face of the charm offensive for private firms,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Center, formerly chief economist at UBS. “Beijing has, in effect, told the world there is no real difference between private and public in the Chinese Communist Party’s eyes.” CK Hutchison shares dropped the most in more than a week after resuming trading Monday. Work on the Panama ports deal is continuing, though the parties won’t be able to sign the definitive agreement by the original target of April 2, people familiar with the matter said. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing opposed coercion at a regular briefing Monday in Beijing, referring to Trump’s efforts to pressure the Panama government to curb Chinese influence. The State Administration for Market Regulation didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. The Panama Canal, used mainly by the US and China, became a geopolitical lightning rod after Trump vowed to retake it. The US president has falsely said the canal is operated by the Chinese and controlled by the Chinese military. CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous former British colony where companies are given wide berth to operate free from Beijing’s control. The spat over the ports comes at a delicate time, as China grapples with a US trade war that will likely this week see Trump unveil new so-called reciprocal tariffs. For Xi, there are few good options: Blocking the Panama deal risks more retaliation from Washington, while letting it go ahead removes a potential bargaining chip once negotiations between Chinese and US officials finally get underway. The dilemma also comes as the Chinese leader tries to build on DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough spurring a revival in animal spirits, with Xi’s recent embrace of Jack Ma signaling to CEOs the era of regulatory crackdowns is over. “Beijing won’t hesitate to intervene if it believes a Chinese company is being pressured by a foreign government to sell its assets to foreign investors,” research firm Trivium China said in a note. Until a formal agreement on the port deal is signed, China’s ability to directly block the transaction is limited. That could explain why Beijing is ramping up pressure through less formal channels, hoping that Li will walk away from the deal. Opening a probe into a deal spanning 43 facilities over multiple continents would mark the latest example of Beijing extending the long arm of its statecraft toolkit. That comes after China last year expanded its export control regime to include a ban on selling some goods to the US by applying it to companies both inside and outside China. Beijing has precedent for influencing deals overseas when the companies involved have a major presence in China. Chinese officials effectively scuttled Intel Corp.’s $5.4 billion bid for Israel’s Tower Semiconductor Ltd. in 2023 by delaying approval as US-China tensions rose. The year before, DuPont de Nemours Inc. scrapped a proposed $5.2 billion acquisition of Rogers Corp. after failing to get timely clearance from Beijing. China sales accounted for more than a third of Rogers’ 2021 revenue. China could even frame its action as a countermeasure to foreign sanctions, invoking a new law that gives Beijing broad power to strike back at perceived foreign meddling, according to Winston Ma, adjunct law professor at New York University. “The countermeasure could have far-reaching implications for cross-border transactions and the various parties involved,” Ma said. After years of deleveraging from China, CK Hutchison now gets more than 80% of its revenue from overseas countries including the UK, Canada and Australia. That means Beijing has limited scope to influence Li directly. But his two sons are more exposed. CK Asset — the company’s property arm now headed by Li’s older son Victor — has one-fifth of its long-term rental investment property portfolio by area on the mainland. Richard Li’s insurance company, FWD Group Holdings Ltd., has stated its ambition to expand into mainland China in financial documents, which would likely require partnerships with Chinese companies. For the Hong Kong conglomerate caught in the crossfire, there are downsides to both outcomes, according to Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics. If the deal goes ahead, Li’s affiliated companies in China “could be exposed to a substantial fine,” he said. “If the deal collapses, the risk is that the company will now be seen as part and parcel of Chinese interests abroad.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Could Threaten Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status, BlackRock’s Larry Fink

Still a big fan of digital assets, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink nevertheless said he's not blind to the possible risks to the U.S. from Bitcoin's (BTC) rise to prominence. “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades," said Fink in his annual letter to shareholders.But that’s not guaranteed to last forever … If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” "I'm obviously not anti-digital assets," Fink continued." But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America's economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink’s letter comes at a time of high market uncertainty and anxiety among investors about the economic state of the country amid policy changes set in place by U.S. President Donald Trump. To balance out the national deficit, Fink said, investors should diversify their portfolios to add private market assets in addition to stocks and bonds. Doubling down on his commitment and belief in digital assets, Fink said he believes that tokenized funds will be as well-known among investors as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), provided that the industry can create a better infrastructure for digital identities, which Fink believes to be a hurdle in getting institutional investors from fully embracing decentralized finance. “Every stock, every bond, every fund— every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing,” he wrote. “ If we're serious about building an efficient and accessible financial system, championing tokenization alone won't suffice. We must solve digital verification, too.” BlackRock, in January 2024, became one of the issuers to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Their product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), became the most successful ETF in the history of the asset class. As of today, the fund handles nearly $50 billion in assets, with half of that coming from retail investors. The asset manager has also issued a tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which is on track to cross $2 billion in assets by April, making it the largest tokenized fund currently on the market.

Title: Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock — this time in private markets

BlackRock was founded as a "traditional asset manager," and it became the largest by disrupting that industry by offering cheap ETFs to the masses. But, as the firm's cofounder and CEO, Larry Fink, wrote in his annual letter, "It's not who we are anymore." "We've transformed our company," Fink wrote about the $11.6 trillion juggernaut. The firm's private-market ambitions are no secret — BlackRock spent $28 billion last year buying up Global Infrastructure Partners and HPS Investment Partners as well as Preqin, a data provider that focuses on private markets. Fink and fellow executives have spoken at length about their ambitions in the area on earnings calls and more. Still, it's rare for any company to pivot away from what has been its bread-and-butter profit engine, much less the industry leader. BlackRock's business lines in public markets, from its overwhelming iShares ETF line to its fixed-income mutual fund products, manage trillions of dollars, produce billions in revenue each year, and have fundamentally changed the way markets and investors behave. But Fink wrote that he is eyeing something bigger with BlackRock's next phase: the "$68 billion investment boom" coming in privately funded infrastructure, the continued explosion of private lending, and eventually, the indexing of private markets. "In some ways, this moment feels like a bookend to how BlackRock started," Fink wrote. When the firm was founded 37 years ago, Fink wrote, it changed the asset management industry thanks to its risk management software known as Aladdin. The firm's ETF business — which manages more than $4 trillion — brought down fees industrywide in both active and passive funds, squeezing asset manager margins in ways they'd never been before. "Decades from now, we might reflect on 2025 as another pivotal moment, when the financial landscape shifted once again," he wrote. And it is shifting to the private markets because the 60-40 portfolio that had investors split assets between public equities and bonds will become the 50-30-20 portfolio, with a fifth of capital going "assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit," Fink wrote. That type of portfolio for the typical individual investor — the ones not in the upper tiers of the tax bracket, but instead saving for retirement with BlackRock index funds — has been unobtainable, Fink wrote, thanks to high minimums and other restrictions on private-market investing. "The divide between public and private markets is a tough problem — but it's solvable. In fact, BlackRock has solved market challenges like this before," Fink wrote, comparing it to the divide between active and passive investing in the public markets. "We see an opportunity to do for the public-private market divide what we did for index vs. active," he said. While Fink's letter has some political undertones, addressing wealth disparities and how markets and capitalism have exacerbated them, it does not mention ESG investing or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Fink was a leading voice on both issues prior to the new US administration, but BlackRock has joined others in the corporate world in toning down past statements. The manager's latest annual report reframed its DEI section as "connectivity and inclusivity," Business Insider previously reported. Fink, who wrote that he started on Wall Street in the 1970s with "long hair, turquoise jewelry, and the world's ugliest brown suit," is nonetheless optimistic despite the political turmoil. He closed his letter stating that the firm "entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point, and I see greater opportunities ahead for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders than ever before."

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink confirms Bitcoin could replace US dollar as global currency amid rising US debt

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink officially recognized in his 2025 annual letter to shareholders that Bitcoin can challenge the U.S. dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. The letter explicitly frames Bitcoin as both a disruptive innovation and a geopolitical risk should the U.S. government fail to rein in debt and deficits. Fink wrote in the firm’s March 2025 letter, “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” The comment marks a clear acknowledgment from the head of the world’s largest asset manager that digital assets could represent an alternative to the U.S. dollar in global markets. Fink mentioned Bitcoin by name seven times throughout the letter while referencing the dollar eight times. The significance of this parallel frequency in Fink’s annual letter cannot be overstated. A few years ago, who would have thought that Larry Fink would spend as much time talking about Bitcoin as the US dollar in an annual letter to investors? The BlackRock letter outlines a split view that while DeFi is praised as “an extraordinary innovation,” the firm cautions that its growth could undermine America’s financial primacy. The risk emerges if investors begin treating Bitcoin as a more stable long-term store of value than the U.S. dollar, particularly given ongoing federal deficits and sovereign debt levels. This framing positions Bitcoin as more than a speculative asset or store of value and as a macro hedge against sovereign instability. The implications parallel similar arguments made in recent years by institutional investors treating digital assets as insurance against monetary debasement or geopolitical volatility. As Fink emphasized, “two things can be true at the same time,” referring to the coexistence of innovation and risk in digital asset development. BlackRock’s internal positioning on Bitcoin is not purely theoretical. The letter disclosed that its U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF became the largest product launch in the history of the ETF industry, reaching over $50 billion in assets under management within its first year. It also ranked third in net asset inflows across all ETF categories, behind only S&P 500 index funds. Retail adoption was a key driver, with more than half the demand for the firm’s Bitcoin ETP coming from individual investors. Notably, three-quarters of those participants had never previously owned an iShares product, suggesting Bitcoin is acting as an onboarding mechanism for a new demographic of investors. The firm has also expanded its ETP offerings into Canada and Europe, signaling cross-border growth in institutional-grade Bitcoin investment vehicles. Beyond Bitcoin, Fink’s letter advanced a broader thesis that tokenization could transform capital markets in ways comparable to the shift from postal mail to email. Drawing a comparison to the SWIFT network, Fink argued that tokenized asset infrastructure could bypass traditional financial intermediaries by enabling instant, peer-to-peer asset movement. BlackRock sees tokenization as a foundational shift in asset ownership, mainly through fractionalization, improved voting systems, and increased access to high-yield investment instruments. According to the letter, these developments could democratize capital markets by lowering the operational and legal barriers that have historically limited retail investor participation in certain asset classes. The firm also emphasized the need for updated digital identity systems, citing India’s model as a benchmark. According to the letter, over 90% of Indians can securely verify smartphone transactions, positioning the country as a leader in the digital infrastructure necessary for tokenized economies. The inclusion of Bitcoin as a potential replacement for the dollar reflects a material shift in institutional perception. While mainstream recognition of Bitcoin as “digital gold” has grown in recent years, BlackRock’s language points to a deeper economic thesis—one in which macroeconomic policy failure could accelerate a pivot to decentralized monetary systems. By citing both tokenization and Bitcoin within the same strategic outlook, the letter presents a framework where digital assets are possible systemic alternatives to fiat. For policymakers, the message is implicit but pointed: the U.S. must modernize its financial systems and manage its debt trajectory to maintain monetary leadership.

Bitcoin has surged over the last year, with the bitcoin price soaring to record highs as a perfect storm of Washington DC and Wall Street collide. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped back from its peak of $110,000 per bitcoin reached in January ahead of U.S. president Donald Trump’s return to the White House (and hit by fears of a mystery new threat). Now, as top traders bet on a looming Federal Reserve flip, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has warned bitcoin could be “eating away” at the U.S. dollar’s world’s reserve currency status. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the most bullish Wall Street voices on ... More bitcoin and crypto, helping push the bitcoin price to record highs last year. "The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever," Fink wrote in his BlackRock annual letter, pointing to ballooning nation debt that’s seen this year’s interest payments alone top $952 billion. “By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like bitcoin.” U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024 before climbing over $35 trillion just a year later, with Covid-era stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." “To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it),” Fink wrote, pointing to his plan to “democratize” access to finance and markets with crypto technology. "But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar." Fink’s warning echos similar sentiment expressed by the likes of Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, who last month called the climbing U.S. debt clock “terrifying" and last year repeatedly warned of U.S. financial collapse while on the campaign trail for Trump. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen from its all-time high but remains well above its 2024 levels. Earlier this month, Fink warned Trump’s trade policies will see a return of inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

Title: Mindshare-driven, high-momentum bets are the future of crypto VC investing

Leveraging fast-paced, narrative-based strategies helps VCs navigate the shifting crypto landscape and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post and opinion of Hatu Sheikh, the founder of Coin Terminal. The traditional crypto VC investing model has failed. VC firms have returned to their drawing boards to strategically reorganize and optimally allocate funds in a highly competitive market. Driven by cyclical market conditions, VCs have realized their success doesn’t depend on following a fundamental conviction. Instead, it hinges on investing in projects with dominant mindshare, strong narratives, and successful go-to-market (GTM) execution strategies. Inspired by the recent rise of mindshare-led investments, VC investing is shifting from long-term to short-term, high-momentum bets. Crypto VCs, who once shaped industry narratives with large capital reserves, have become weaker in recent years. Multiple internal and external factors have been responsible for the subdued VC landscape. According to a JP Morgan research report, regulatory uncertainty under the Joe Biden administration and enforcement actions against major companies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had kept away VCs. Further, the growth of crypto ETPs and institutional capital inflows from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have diverted capital away from VC firms. Large investors like hedge funds and endowment agencies have gained exposure to crypto via liquid financial instruments rather than early-stage VC investing. High interest rates have also lowered VCs’ risk appetite. This compromises investments in high-risk products with greater ROIs, although speculation and volatility are intertwined with crypto — they’re features, not bugs. To top it off, standardized VC crypto funding is inherently broken. The massive failure of VC-backed firms that funded projects in 2021-2022 has cautioned generalist VCs. The failure reflects a lack of a proper investment strategy rather than a dismissal of the industry itself. Overall, capital allocation to venture funds has declined over the years. Crypto VC fundraising was the lowest in 2024 in the last five years, with just $5.1 billion raised. Despite a bull market in 2024, VC investments have been inversely proportional to the success of the crypto markets. The liquid crypto market added $1.6 trillion to its total market cap in 2024, rising 88% YoY to $3.4 trillion. Yet, VCs invested just $11.5 billion in crypto startups. The stark difference represents VCs’ pessimism and failure to understand the essence of crypto markets. While chasing fundamentals, VCs have forgotten to tap into the hottest meta and dominant market narratives. In turn, their shrinking capital reserves have flown into white elephant projects without substantial returns, making VC investing entirely unprofitable. On the contrary, retail users who invested in categories occupying the highest mindshare and actionable real-world use cases have been immensely successful. VCs have a lot to learn from this retail-led investment strategy. The JP Morgan report noted that several crypto startups have avoided token sales to VCs and turned to community-driven fundraising strategies in 2024. Community, the centerpiece of crypto, has thus reclaimed its space and shown VCs how to stay buoyant in cyclical market narratives. Per a CoinGecko report, memecoins led the market mindshare and were “the most popular crypto narrative in 2024”. The memecoin market cap rose to $137 billion in December 2024, driven mainly by retail investors. Critics have dismissed memecoins as a speculative fad. But memecoins have powered retail crypto adoption as a survey shows over 40% of people were first-time Trump and Melania tokens investors. AI tokens, the second-most popular narrative in 2024, captured 16% of investor mindshare as retailers deployed capital for building futuristic financial technology. The AI token market capitalization can reach $60 billion in 2025, and early investors have an edge as the industry matures. VCs have traditionally preferred fundamentals over mindshare-based investing because they believed the former translates to long-term dividends. As the data suggests, this is not necessarily the case. The crypto industry moves quickly. Blindly following fundamental convictions without updating and acclimatizing to changing market conditions leads to a dead end. VCs have finally realized their mistakes and are ready to shift gears. They’re now leveraging mindshare-based investment strategies to identify disruptive sectors and deploy capital for their growth. Once VCs take cues from the dominant mindshare in a cyclical market, they can invest early in projects with robust GTM plans. Consequently, VCs can book profits when the sector develops and the projects launch consumer-facing apps with real-world uses. Bloomberg suggests the “fintech winter” ended when VC funding was down due to high interest and strict regulations. With more regulatory clarity during the Trump regime, crypto VC funding will pick up pace with an estimated $18 billion in fresh capital inflows. VCs should be wise enough to know how to use these funds. Instead of channeling them into dead fundamentals, they must follow a mindshare-driven investing approach to support early-stage innovations for profitable balance sheets. As multiple narratives compete for limited mindshare in the crypto industry, VCs must know how to utilize their capital reserves. Mindshare-based investing offers a symbiotic alternative, benefitting the industry and VCs simultaneously. Hatu Sheikh is the founder of Coin Terminal. He previously co-founded DAO Maker.

Title: US, China raise the stakes in Panama Canal ports row

Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison this month sold 43 ports in 23 countries -- including operations in the vital Central American canal -- to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. After two weeks of rhetoric, Beijing hardened its response on Friday and confirmed that antitrust regulators will review the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned. Speaking before the review was announced, experts told AFP that the deal allowed US President Donald Trump to claim credit for "taking back" the canal as part of his "America First" agenda. "The US (created) a political issue at China's expense and then has been able to declare victory," said Kurt Tong, managing partner at The Asia Group and a former top US diplomat to Hong Kong. "That doesn't feel good in Beijing." Some of the ports being sold are in nations that participate in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- a global development framework championed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Ports are crucial to that network and China "has been notably successful in this area", said Henry Gao, a trade law expert at the Singapore Management University. Last month, Panama formally exited the BRI following a visit from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "There is indeed a growing trend of 'weaponising' ports and trade infrastructure as tools of geopolitical leverage," Gao said. - 'Nightmare' scenario? - On March 4, CK Hutchison sent shockwaves through China's shipping industry by announcing a deal of "unprecedented scale", according to Xie Wenqing, a port development researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. Chinese shipping firms questioned whether they could ensure neutral passage once the ports changed hands, he told AFP. "There are concerns about additional costs for Chinese ships or discriminatory treatment in terms of queuing orders," he added, highlighting the long-arm jurisdiction of US authorities. The deal -- coupled with recent US tariff hikes -- could undermine China's manufacturing dominance, argued Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China. "Increased inspections and additional docking costs would erode China's competitive edge and disrupt global supply chains," he noted. The United States has used various justifications to target key infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative "to strip away these assets and weaken China's position as the world's factory", Wang added. John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said the deal would not serve China's interests but said some concerns were "overblown". Port operators such as CK Hutchison are commercial entities constrained by law and cannot decide matters of national sovereignty, for example whether a ship could visit a port or not. "If (operators) were to blatantly favour one company over another, that would generally speaking... be illegal," Bradford said. "Most countries have laws which say you have to treat different customers similarly, so the nightmare scenarios are not particularly realistic." - Hong Kong's role - Beijing's next steps in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, according to analysts. "This whole Panama ports issue has refocused attention on the question (of) whether Hong Kong is a good place to put assets or to do business," said Tong, the former diplomat. "Certainly the foreign business community operating in Hong Kong is watching this issue very closely." CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. That did not stop the State Administration for Market Regulation from announcing the antitrust review on Friday. Jet Deng, a senior partner at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons, said China's antitrust laws can be applicable outside its borders, similar to those of the United States and the European Union. Once a deal meets China's reportability threshold, a declaration is required even if the transaction takes place abroad, as long as the parties involved had substantial operations in mainland China, he said. Firms that fail to declare may be fined for up to 10 percent of their operating income from the preceding year, Deng added. Hung Ho-fung, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said Beijing risks spooking "cautious" foreign firms that have already lowered their business exposure in Hong Kong. If the deal crumbles under Chinese pressure, people may believe that Hong Kong is converging with mainland China where "national security considerations are of utmost importance in any business deal", Hung said. ll-hol/je/rsc/fox BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News After two weeks of rhetoric, Beijing hardened its response on Friday and confirmed that antitrust regulators will review the deal, likely preventing the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as planned.

Jet Deng, a senior partner at the Beijing office of law firm Dentons, said China's antitrust laws can be applicable outside its borders, similar to those of the United States and the European Union. Once a deal meets China's reportability threshold, a declaration is required even if the transaction takes place abroad, as long as the parties involved had substantial operations in mainland China, he said. Firms that fail to declare may be fined for up to 10 percent of their operating income from the preceding year, Deng added. Hung Ho-fung, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, said Beijing risks spooking "cautious" foreign firms that have already lowered their business exposure in Hong Kong. If the deal crumbles under Chinese pressure, people may believe that Hong Kong is converging with mainland China where "national security considerations are of utmost importance in any business deal", Hung said. ll-hol/je/rsc/fox BLACKROCK Related Links Global Trade News - 'Nightmare' scenario? - On March 4, CK Hutchison sent shockwaves through China's shipping industry by announcing a deal of "unprecedented scale", according to Xie Wenqing, a port development researcher at the Shanghai International Shipping Institute. Chinese shipping firms questioned whether they could ensure neutral passage once the ports changed hands, he told AFP. "There are concerns about additional costs for Chinese ships or discriminatory treatment in terms of queuing orders," he added, highlighting the long-arm jurisdiction of US authorities. The deal -- coupled with recent US tariff hikes -- could undermine China's manufacturing dominance, argued Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at the Renmin University of China. "Increased inspections and additional docking costs would erode China's competitive edge and disrupt global supply chains," he noted. The United States has used various justifications to target key infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative "to strip away these assets and weaken China's position as the world's factory", Wang added. John Bradford, executive director of the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said the deal would not serve China's interests but said some concerns were "overblown". Port operators such as CK Hutchison are commercial entities constrained by law and cannot decide matters of national sovereignty, for example whether a ship could visit a port or not. "If (operators) were to blatantly favour one company over another, that would generally speaking... be illegal," Bradford said. "Most countries have laws which say you have to treat different customers similarly, so the nightmare scenarios are not particularly realistic." - Hong Kong's role - Beijing's next steps in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, according to analysts. "This whole Panama ports issue has refocused attention on the question (of) whether Hong Kong is a good place to put assets or to do business," said Tong, the former diplomat.

Title: Fractional Dreams: How Tokenisation is Unlocking Assets in Emerging Markets (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

Full Content:
Imagine a young professional in Nairobi buying a digital slice of a new apartment building, a cattle farmer in Bolivia selling tokens backed by his herd, or a street vendor in Mumbai investing in a fraction of a tech company’s stock – all through a smartphone. This isn’t sci‑fi finance; it’s the promise of fractionalisation and tokenisation. These buzzwords are redefining who gets to own assets and how, especially across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In this long read, we’ll demystify what tokenisation and fractionalisation really mean, explore why they matter for financially underserved populations, and dive into real‑world examples in real estate, equities, and even livestock. The goal: help you understand (and maybe even get excited about) how a fractional future could unlock wealth and opportunity in emerging markets. Demystifying Tokenisation and Fractionalisation Let’s start with the basics. Tokenisation is essentially turning an asset or a right into a digital token – a kind of digital certificate of ownership recorded on a blockchain. Think of a token as a digital deed or share that proves you own something of value. It could be a token representing a square meter of land, a share of stock, or one cow in a herd. Once created, these tokens live on a blockchain, making their ownership records immutable and tamper‑proof. In practical terms, tokenisation often uses smart contracts (self‑executing code on the blockchain) to automate the process of splitting and managing ownership. For example, a property could be divided into digital shares via a smart contract so that investors can buy or sell parts of it by trading tokens. These tokens can be designed to carry information like ownership rights, dividend or rental entitlements, and transaction history – all baked into code. Fractionalisation, on the other hand, is the process of splitting an asset into smaller pieces (fractions) so that multiple people can own a portion of it. It’s a concept as old as joint ownership, but blockchain‑based tokenisation turbocharges it. If tokenisation is turning an asset into a tradable digital form, fractionalisation is what lets many people hold a piece of that digital asset. An easy analogy is slicing a big pizza: Instead of one person devouring a whole pie, it’s cut into slices so a group can each enjoy a piece. In finance, this means a million‑dollar asset can be split into, say, a million $1 tokens. Each token holder owns a tiny slice. By combining tokenisation with fractionalisation, almost any asset can be divided and distributed to many owners quickly and with low friction. A simple example: imagine a $100,000 real estate property represented by 100,000 tokens – each token might represent a $1 stake in the property’s value and any corresponding rental income. You could buy 50 tokens for $50 and legitimately claim 0.05% ownership. Thanks to blockchain’s transparency, everyone’s fractional ownership is securely recorded and easily verifiable. The beauty of this “power couple” of finance is that it brings automation, security, and trust to shared ownership. Blockchains operate 24/7, so these tokens can be traded peer‑to‑peer at any time, without the heavy paperwork of traditional asset sales. Transfers are near‑instant and don’t rely on a parade of middlemen for clearing or settlement, which reduces costs and friction. Smart contracts can even handle things like distributing dividends or rental income to token holders automatically (no accountant writing 1000 cheques). In short, tokenisation turns assets into programmable pieces and fractionalisation ensures even the “little guy” can hold a piece. Why Tokenisation Matters for Emerging Markets So, why should someone in an emerging market care about these fancy concepts? Because they have the potential to democratize finance and unlock access in places where traditional systems haven’t fully delivered. In many emerging economies, large segments of the population are underserved by banks or excluded from investing. Owning property or stocks is often a luxury reserved for the wealthy or well‑connected. Meanwhile, many people store their wealth in informal assets – cash stashed under a mattress, gold jewelry, or livestock in the field – because formal investments feel out of reach. Tokenisation directly tackles some of these barriers: All these reasons boil down to one big theme: financial inclusion. By breaking big assets into bite‑sized digital pieces, tokenisation and fractionalisation extend the investing club to far more people. Importantly, this isn’t just theoretical. It’s already underway in various forms across emerging markets. Let’s delve into three key asset classes – real estate, equities, and livestock – to see how it works in practice and why it matters. Real Estate: Owning Property One Token at a Time Real estate is often seen as a stable way to build wealth, but owning property traditionally requires huge upfront capital and involves plenty of red tape. In cities from Lagos to Lahore, property prices can be stratospheric relative to local incomes, meaning the vast majority can only ever dream of owning a piece of prime real estate. Tokenisation is starting to change that equation by dividing bricks and mortar into bits and bytes. Take Kenya, for example. The Kenyan government is building a high‑tech new city called Konza Technopolis, with a hefty budget running into billions. It’s the kind of large‑scale project that typically only big investors or funds would have a stake in. But imagine everyone being able to own a slice of that city’s development through fractional tokens. Kenya’s regulators are already looking ahead by admitting blockchain‑based real estate platforms into controlled regulatory sandboxes. These pilots use smart contracts to automate splitting property into digital shares, letting investors buy and sell fractional ownership. The authorities see these models as an “important stride” toward enhancing retail participation in the real estate market, giving ordinary Kenyans access to a highly coveted asset class that was previously out of reach. Other African nations are dipping toes in as well. South Africa has seen tokenised commercial property deals, and Nigeria is exploring tokenised real estate in Lagos to attract retail investors. Even where formal projects are still nascent, the interest is high. In Uganda, for instance, innovators have crunched the numbers on how fractional ownership could work. Consider a commercial building valued at a significant sum; it could be tokenised into hundreds of thousands of tokens, each representing a tiny ownership stake. An investor buying a modest number of tokens would own a small percentage of the building and earn a proportional share of the rental income. And when the investor wants out, they could sell their tokens to someone else, rather than having to endure a months‑long property sale. It effectively transforms a brick‑and‑mortar asset into a liquid investment. The benefits for the broader market are significant. By lowering the barrier to entry, tokenised real estate can tap into pools of capital that were previously sidelined. A middle‑class family in Accra or a collective of school teachers in Lima could pool funds to back a housing development via tokens. This democratises funding for projects – potentially helping address housing shortages. Liquidity is another plus: real estate usually can’t be sold quickly, but token markets promise more fluid trading. It’s not just startups and crypto enthusiasts pushing this. Even major global players are on board, lending credibility. Firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have launched initiatives in tokenised assets, indicating that a significant chunk of assets may shift on‑chain in coming years. That institutional vote of confidence bodes well for emerging markets adopting similar tech. And regulators, while cautious, are increasingly open‑minded. Beside Kenya’s sandbox, jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Thailand are actively updating laws to accommodate tokenised real‑world assets. The upshot for a banker or regulator in an emerging market is clear: this trend is real and it’s not going away. Embracing it offers a way to mobilise local investment while expanding access. Equities: Stocks for the People If real estate tokenisation is about broadening property ownership, tokenised equities are about making stock ownership more accessible and versatile. Equities (shares in companies) are already “fractional” in the sense that owning a tiny percentage of a large company is common. But historically, buying stocks required a brokerage account, compliance with local rules, and often a hefty sum of money to get started. In many emerging markets, stock market participation is very low – only a small fraction of the population invests in equities. Barriers include lack of awareness, limited disposable income, and sometimes a dearth of local companies that people feel connected to. Furthermore, if someone in Bangladesh wants to invest in a U.S. tech giant, the hurdles are enormous under traditional finance. Tokenisation can knock down these walls. By creating digital tokens that represent shares (or economic interests in shares) of a company, you can enable people to buy and trade those tokens globally, 24/7, with just a mobile app. Consider a young entrepreneur in Jakarta who idolizes big tech – maybe he can only spare $50, nowhere near enough to buy a full share at market price. But a token platform might offer a fractional token of that stock, so his $50 could get him a piece of a share. Multiply that by millions of aspiring investors and you have a recipe for much broader equity ownership. It’s essentially the “stocks for everyone” idea that some fintech brokers have popularised, now supercharged by blockchain. The technology angle also adds benefits beyond fractional share sizes. Blockchain‑based stock tokens could be traded instantly, 24/7 (no waiting for stock exchange hours) and settle immediately, rather than enduring the typical multi‑day settlement cycle. This always‑on market means investors in different time zones aren’t left behind. It also means that if there’s breaking news at night, you could react immediately instead of waiting for the exchange to open next morning. Enhanced liquidity and improved price discovery are just part of the package. For emerging market investors, such a system could be a lifeline during volatile periods – allowing quick adjustments in response to local or global financial shifts. Beyond global giants, tokenised equities could help local businesses and startups raise capital. Traditional stock exchanges in frontier markets often have few listings and strict requirements. But imagine a promising local company issuing security tokens to the public as an alternative to an IPO. This would let the community invest in a local business easily. Essentially, it’s equity crowdfunding 2.0 on blockchain. For instance, a farmer’s cooperative in Indonesia could tokenise shares in their processing plant; villagers could buy tokens and collectively fund a project that also gives them ownership stake. It blends community finance with modern tech. From a bank’s perspective, tokenised equities might trigger some caution – questions about investor protection, custody, and compliance are real. However, they also represent an opportunity. Banks can act as custodians or issuers for these tokens, bridging trust by holding the underlying stocks and issuing tokens to customers. This approach, if paired with sound regulatory oversight, could bring the benefits of digital-native experiences to a broader investor base while preserving the stability of traditional systems. Livestock: From Pastures to the Blockchain Ledger Imagine a pastoral scene where cows and goats, long cherished as markers of wealth and social standing, are transformed into digital assets – tradable on a blockchain as easily as shares of a company. In many emerging markets, livestock isn’t just an asset; it’s a way of life. It’s used for dowries, as collateral, or as a store of value. Yet livestock is an illiquid asset – you can’t easily sell 1/10th of a cow when you need cash. Enter tokenisation. Pilot projects have shown that tokenising livestock can be both practical and beneficial. In Latin America, an innovative venture launched a token to fractionalise the revenue stream of a cattle ranch, effectively selling shares in the ranch’s output. Investors worldwide could buy tokens representing a small stake in the ranch, sharing in the proceeds when cattle are sold, all without ever touching a cow. This model enables farmers to raise capital without liquidating their herd and allows small investors to access an asset class traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Over in Argentina, a project called BitCow has taken a bold step by backing each token with a real, live cow. When you buy a BitCow token, you effectively own a stake in an actual cow managed by a farming company. As the cow produces calves, token rewards are issued to token holders – much like receiving dividends in the form of additional tokens. In regions where livestock represents a significant economic and cultural asset, such innovations can make the difference between exclusion and empowerment. Now picture similar ideas applied in Africa or Asia. In Kenya or Tanzania, owning cattle is a sign of wealth. A platform could allow local farmers to tokenise parts of their herds, letting investors from around the world purchase tokens equivalent to, say, one goat or a fraction of a cow. Farmers get much‑needed cash flow while token holders gain a tradable, fractional asset. This system could also facilitate novel insurance or lending mechanisms – a farmer might pledge livestock tokens as collateral for a loan, rather than risking the sale of the actual animal. Such models extend traditional practices of shared community livestock ownership into the digital age. Tokenising livestock also introduces greater transparency and oversight in sectors often marred by opaque records. With each animal tokenised and its history recorded on blockchain, stakeholders can verify health records, pedigree, and performance. This can improve food safety and attract more investment into agriculture – a sector vital to many emerging economies. The View from the Regulator’s Saddle (and the Banker’s Desk) No discussion of financial innovation would be complete without touching on regulation and the role of incumbent institutions. It’s understandable that the idea of freely trading tokens representing cows, condos, or company shares might initially raise eyebrows among regulators and bankers. Questions abound: How do we ensure tokens aren’t misused? What legal rights do token holders have? And how do we manage taxation and investor protection? The good news is that regulators in many regions are engaging with these questions. Controlled regulatory sandboxes in countries like Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia, and beyond are allowing fintech experiments under watchful eyes. This approach lets innovation proceed in a limited way to gather data, while containing risk. From a bank’s perspective, tokenisation isn’t a threat but an opportunity. Banks can partner with fintech companies to offer tokenised products, act as custodians, and even provide advisory services around digital assets. With proper frameworks and transparency, tokenisation can be integrated safely, unlocking new revenue streams and expanding financial inclusion. Embracing the Fractional Future In emerging markets, where the need for financial inclusion and efficient capital allocation is most acute, fractionalisation and tokenisation present a compelling way forward. We’ve seen how a single cow can be divided among many owners, or how a building can be owned by a thousand people. These aren’t just gimmicks – they reflect a future where finance is more inclusive, assets are more liquid, and innovation bridges cultural traditions with modern technology. For the everyday user, this means opportunity. Small investors can diversify and participate in economic growth like never before, whether it’s owning a bit of farmland in Latin America, a flat in an Asian metropolis, or a share of a thriving Nigerian business. For asset owners, it means new ways to unlock the value of what they hold without having to sell it all at once – transforming illiquid assets into spendable wealth incrementally. And for the broader economy, it means mobilising dormant capital into productive uses. There are, of course, challenges – technology risks, education gaps, and the need for robust trust frameworks. Yet emerging markets have a history of leapfrogging outdated systems, much like the success of mobile money in Africa. With the right approach, tokenisation and fractionalisation can do for asset ownership what mobile money did for financial inclusion. The future of finance might very well be fractional – a future where everyone, regardless of income or location, can own a piece of what builds our economy. And that’s a revolution worth embracing.

Four in five Irish workers are still not aware of the details of the incoming compulsory workplace pension regime just six months out from the launch date, according to a survey carried out by US investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock is understood to be among asset managers lining up a bid to manage part of the so-called auto-enrolment pension pot. The scheme will capture up to 800,000 workers between the ages of 23 and 60 and earning more than €20,000 who are not currently part of a pension plan, at the end of September. BlackRock’s 2025 Ireland Read on Retirement report also said that only 41 per cent of Irish workers feel they are on track for a reasonable standard of living on retirement. This falls to 26 per cent across individuals that do not have a defined contribution (DC) workplace pension. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment in the Republic of Ireland it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” said Tim Hodgson, of BlackRock’s UK & Ireland DC Platforms and Retirement Solutions. “Irish workers face similar challenges to those encountered by retirement savers around the world. The introduction of auto-enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.” The Department of Social Protection launched a long-delayed official search for three companies to manage the investment of contributions that will be made by employers, employees and the State into the auto-enrolment pot. Each will have to provide fund options of low, medium and high risk. Investment managers interested in the business have until April 7th to pitch for it. BlackRock is expected to compete alongside Amundi, Irish Life’s investment management arm, State Street Global Advisors and others for one of the three contracts. The “request for tender” document says that there may be €21 billion in assets under management in the My Future Fund – the name given to the auto-enrolment scheme – within 10 years. The document, filed on the Government’s eTenders website, sets a cap on any all-inclusive annual management charge of 0.1 per cent of the assets under management. Under auto-enrolment employers and employees will both contribute 1.5 per cent of their gross earnings to it initially, with the State adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions of all parties will gradually increase, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively by 2034. The BlackRock survey results reflect an international trend of poor retirement readiness. BlackRock’s UK Read on Retirement published in 2024 found that nearly three-quarters of UK DC pension savers feel they are not on track to achieve a reasonable standard of living in retirement while 60 per cent of workers who participated in a US study said they feared outliving their retirement savings.

Title: Institutions Embrace Bitcoin While The UK Falls Behind

BySusie Violet Ward BySusie Violet Ward, Contributor. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 29: People pass through the Bank area of the City of London on May 29, 2024 in ... More London, England. In recent months, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reportedly met with the boss of Shein, the Chinese-founded fashion retailer, to encourage the company to launch its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. London's reputation as a global financial hub has suffered in the wake of Brexit, compounded by an industry-wide slowdown in public offerings due to high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Photo by Carl Court The UK has a proud history of excellence and innovation in both financial services and in computer science. But its regulatory approach to bitcoin, which sits at the intersection between these disciplines, is undermining that position. The Financial Conduct Authority has created uncertainty, driven businesses offshore, and is damaging the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Regulatory uncertainty, restrictive policies, and a risk-averse approach have put the UK at a disadvantage as institutions elsewhere move forward. While other jurisdictions recognize Bitcoin’s role in institutional finance, UK regulators have created an environment that stifles progress. The Bitcoin for Institutions event, held recently in London at The Law Society, brought together investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to assess bitcoin’s growing significance. The consensus? The rest of the world is advancing while the UK remains stuck in bureaucratic inaction. Bitcoin for Institutions at The Law Society. Allen Farrington, co-founder of Axiom, a bitcoin-native investment firm focused on capital deployment in the bitcoin economy, captured the shift in institutional thinking. He described bitcoin as “forming the basis of a viable institutional asset class.” However, despite bitcoin being the best-performing asset of the decade, UK institutions remain hesitant. The FCA, tasked with ensuring financial stability, has instead become a barrier to innovation, and the result is that businesses have been driven out of the UK, driven out by regulatory hostility or simply deciding that the cost of compliance with poorly thought-out regulation is too high. While the UK stalls, the U.S. moves fast. One message was repeated throughout the event. Ignoring bitcoin is now seen as a career risk. https://x.com/Blockstream/status/1903109220393750840 In the U.S., pension funds, corporate treasuries, and asset managers are integrating bitcoin into their portfolios. In recent months, the largest buyers of bitcoin have not been retail investors or hedge funds, but institutional funds. Andrew Hohns, founder and CEO of Newmarket Investment Management, described the contrast, “Many U.S. companies have started incorporating bitcoin into their financial planning, and many others are well down the road. In the UK, institutional awareness of the benefits of bitcoin is more nascent, but the topic will move closer to center stage as corporate and sovereign game theory quickly take hold." Dominic Frisby summed up the cost of inaction: "Given the potential of bitcoin, and its record, the risk is not so much owning bitcoin as not owning it." In dialogue with Izabella Kaminska, Steve Baker, who served as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office until July 2024, commented on U.S. policymakers’ proactive stance, stating, “It’s great that the US is governed by a group of people who understand this.” In contrast, jurisdictions like the U.S., UAE, and Singapore are attracting capital by implementing frameworks that distinguish between bitcoin and speculative cryptoassets. The FCA has created a framework that treats bitcoin the same as speculative crypto tokens, ignoring its distinct characteristics as a decentralized monetary network. Adrian Cannon from Musqet pointed out this fundamental mismatch, "Bitcoin is revolutionary in ideas and concepts and that doesn’t fit within regulation and banking." Beyond the FCA’s misclassification of bitcoin, the UK’s broader regulatory structure is also a barrier to institutional adoption. Baroness Claire Fox, who sits in the House of Lords, told the audience about a recent government initiative called the Regulatory Innovation Office, which was implemented with the intention of reining in regulators. However, the reality is a system of self-replicating bureaucracy, as she described a quango of regulators where no one has accountability. This structure discourages innovation, shields regulators from scrutiny, and blocks new market entrants, creating a system that protects incumbents while deterring progress. While regulators insist their approach is about protecting investors, the reality is that businesses are being forced offshore, limiting choice and harming competitiveness. Beyond regulatory concerns, institutional adoption has also been slowed by misconceptions about bitcoin’s environmental impact. Discussions at the event highlighted how bitcoin is being used to stabilize energy grids, reduce waste, and improve sustainability. One panel on social benefits discussed bitcoin’s growing role in advancing financial inclusion and human rights - and the fintech products being built to enable this. In regions affected by financial repression, bitcoin is being used to bypass restrictions, support activist movements, and provide stable value transfer in fragile economies. In areas with poor access to banking, whether in sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, or refugee communities, bitcoin offers a way to receive donations, store value, and operate independently from centralised financial institutions. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 30: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of Bitcoin in London, ... More England. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, which has been in use since 2009. Photo illustration by Edward Smith Recent data indicates that over 50% of bitcoin mining is now powered by renewable energy sources. Miners are increasingly co-locating with wind, solar, and hydro projects, acting as flexible demand-response partners and absorbing excess energy when supply outpaces demand and powering down during peak consumption to relieve pressure on the grid. In the UK, this model could deliver substantial savings, especially given that electricity prices here are among the highest in the world. Reducing energy costs could offer a vital boost to both households and businesses facing mounting bills. According to the National Grid ESO, curtailment of wind power alone cost British consumers over £800 million in 2023, as renewable generators were paid to shut down during periods of oversupply, with the tab being picked up by households. If this curtailed energy were redirected to bitcoin mining, an approach already implemented in parts of the U.S., Scandinavia, and Africa, it would reduce these costs and provide an additional revenue stream for renewable operators. Instead of paying producers to switch off, excess energy could be monetised in real-time, and customers would see immediate savings on their bills. Bitcoin mining is also being used to capture vented methane from oil fields and repurpose landfill gas into electricity, turning environmental liabilities into economic opportunities. These developments challenge legacy thinking and position bitcoin as an energy solution. The discussion repeatedly returned to one key issue, namely that the UK is falling behind. While British firms continue debating whether bitcoin should be included in institutional portfolios, U.S. asset managers and corporate treasurers are already executing their bitcoin strategies. Dominic Frisby captured the financial risk of inaction, "The risk is not owning it." At the same time, institutional investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are increasing their exposure. In recent months, institutional funds have been the largest single buyer of bitcoin. This shift was largely due to BlackRock and Fidelity launching U.S.-approved bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, an institutional milestone that the UK has yet to match. What’s more, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in early March 2025 to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning bitcoin as a strategic asset within the U.S. financial system. ​ The tension between legacy finance and emerging alternatives was clear throughout the event, which was described as a clash between Wall Street and Main Street. The real risk for the UK is not that bitcoin will fail but that it will succeed elsewhere and leave the UK institutions scrambling to catch up. If the UK wants to remain a serious player in global finance, it needs to adapt before the next wave of innovation settles elsewhere. Baroness Claire Fox offered a blunt assessment of the current state of affairs and the path to change, “Rebellion is the way forward.” The Bitcoin for Institutions event clearly demonstrated an unavoidable truth: that UK institutions must act. Regulatory paralysis is not stopping bitcoin’s adoption. It is simply pushing progress elsewhere. While the U.S., UAE, and Singapore create supportive policies, the UK remains locked in bureaucratic complexity. Without a course correction, UK financial firms will be left behind in the next phase of institutional finance. Bitcoin is no longer an emerging trend, it is a financial transformation already in motion. And transformations do not wait for governments and regulators to catch up. This event was held under Chatham House Rule. All participants quoted in this article gave permission for their remarks to be used.

Title: Sustainable investing the new standard
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2991619/sustainable-investing-the-new-standard
Time Published: 2025-03-30T23:15:00Z

ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard. The strategy is considered sustainable, measuring environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact. Environmental factors can include carbon emissions, waste management and sustainability efforts. Social factors involve employee treatment, workplace diversity and community relations. Governance factors value leadership decisions, transparency and business ethics. With growing investor interest and regulatory support, ESG investing is becoming a mainstream approach to building sustainable and profitable portfolios. Research suggests ESG-focused investments often outperform traditional ones, offering competitive returns with less risk. At the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), ESG investment is being prioritised and support is provided to listed companies to align with international ESG standards. Many Thai listed companies received global ESG scores and emerged as industry leaders, recognised by S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025, which evaluates and awards companies for outperforming their peers in sustainability. GROWING POPULARITY Global ESG fund investments have been increasing, with assets under management now exceeding US$40 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Reports from Morningstar and MSCI indicate ESG funds tend to outperform conventional funds in the long term. During the pandemic, global ESG funds recovered more quickly than the overall market. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns. Sustainable businesses are more likely to survive and grow in the long term due to improved risk management in ESG aspects, according to these reports. Governments are introducing regulations on net-zero policies, carbon taxes and ESG standards, affecting companies that fail to adapt. Companies reliant on fossil fuels or lacking ESG policies may face rising costs due to fines, environmental fees, and higher energy costs. Institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Norges Bank emphasise ESG criteria and require companies they invest in to uphold clear sustainability standards. Recognising this trend, the SET supports Thai listed companies in enhancing sustainability. Soraphol Tulayasathien, senior executive vice-president and head of sustainable market development at the SET, said the bourse is driving ESG adoption among listed companies through various initiatives, including the development of the SET ESG Ratings and SET ESG Index. The SET utilises its ESG Ratings to compile the SET ESG Index, which has been published on the SET's website since Nov 6, 2023. The SET ESG Ratings are based on a voluntary sustainability assessment that evaluates companies across ESG dimensions. The assessment is reviewed annually to align with evolving sustainability trends at both global and national levels. To be included in the SET ESG Ratings, listed companies must score at least 50% in each ESG dimension and meet specific criteria, such as corporate governance reporting (CGR) quality, net profit performance, shareholder equity, and adherence to ESG-related compliance standards. Any companies failing to meet these criteria are excluded from the ratings. ESG IN THAILAND More than 100 Thai ESG funds manage some 30 billion baht in assets. Chavinda Hanratanakool, chairwoman of the Association of Investment Management Companies, said firms are encountering greater risks across the global business landscape. "ESG information will be an important tool investors should use to make investment decisions," she said. "Companies that take into account ESG issues can see their business risks reduced, while investors are also focusing on managing their risks." To serve the growing popularity of ESG investments and to prop up a struggling bourse, the government endorsed the Thai ESG Extra (ESG X) fund category last month, designed to encourage investment in sustainable and high-growth equities through substantial tax incentives. Investors can transfer existing holdings from long-term equity funds maturing this year, estimated at 180 billion baht, to Thai ESG X funds to qualify for a tax deduction of up to 500,000 baht. Investors can claim 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, with the remaining 200,000 baht available for deduction in subsequent years at 50,000 baht a year. New investments in Thai ESG X funds are also eligible for a separate tax deduction of 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, provided the units are purchased between May and June. The SET listed 242 stocks for inclusion in Thai ESG and Thai ESG X funds, consisting of 228 companies with SET ESG Ratings and 14 companies disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data. Whether other stocks can be included depends on the individual fund policies. The bourse announced Thai ESG X funds must invest at least 65% of net asset value in securities listed on the SET or Market for Alternative Investment that meet one of the three following sustainability criteria. First, securities that have a good SET ESG Rating or international ESG rating, such as from the FTSE Index or MSCI Index. Second, companies that disclosed greenhouse gas emissions data, and third companies that have a CGR score from the Thai Institute of Directors of at least 90 and disclosed data on at least 85% of their items on the SET ESG data platform. RATINGS BENEFITS Mr Soraphol said an ESG rating serves as a tool for improving sustainable business practices and risk management. Companies receive scores and recommendations in order to enhance their ESG performance, he said. ESG scores allow companies to compare their sustainability performance against peers, while companies gain visibility among sustainable investors, facilitating better access to capital, said Mr Soraphol. "An ESG credit rating benefits investors and analysts, providing a benchmark for comparing companies' ESG performance," he said. For analysts, the rating supports stock valuation and investment decision-making. In addition, the rating helps fund managers develop ESG-focused investment products, said Mr Soraphol. The rating also serves as a tool for investor engagement and corporate ESG advocacy, he said. In 2024, 228 listed companies clinched a spot on the SET ESG Ratings, echoing the growing wave of sustainable investments locally and globally. There are 242 listed companies on the list. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP S&P Global recently launched the Sustainability Yearbook 2025 to recognise top-performing companies in sustainability. The assessment is based on the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which evaluated 7,690 companies on economic and ESG factors. S&P global CSA scores range from 0 to 100 and categorise companies into the top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% globally: The top 1% comprises companies with the highest CSA scores worldwide. The top 5% covers companies ranking just below the top 1%. The top 10% comprises the highest-ranked 10% of companies in each industry. Beyond ESG stocks, investment themes such as climate change, green bonds and carbon credits are gaining traction. The SET partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group through FTSE Russell to enhance ESG assessments in Thailand, aligning SET ESG Ratings with global standards. The assessment methodology, which is used for more than 8,000 securities worldwide, ensures Thai listed firms can be benchmarked against global peers, strengthening investor confidence. A pilot assessment is planned for 2024-2025, with full public ESG score disclosure by 2026. NET-ZERO COMMITMENTS As the SET enters its 50th year, the bourse is driving sustainable capital market development and aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of these efforts, it is developing the SET Carbon system to disclose climate change management data about the capital market, aiming to enhance climate data disclosure and streamline corporate greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The first phase of SET Carbon is available to interested companies in the first quarter of this year. In collaboration with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the bourse is also integrating listed companies' energy consumption data. The SET recently obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognised authority on science-based target setting. The validated targets include a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050. With this distinction, the bourse becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets, alongside Bursa Malaysia, the Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group. "ESG investing is more than just an option, it is the new global investment standard," said Mr Soraphol. Investors prioritising ESG will unlock superior opportunities, while companies committed to sustainability will attract greater investor attention and achieve long-term growth potential, he said.

Crypto users are backing a spot XRP ETF approval on Polymarket as odds soar past 85%. Anticipation for altcoin ETFs has dominated the market since Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024. With US regulatory waters easing, most users have called for possible XRP, SOL, and ADA spot ETFs. On March 24, the odds for a spot XRP ETF in the United States soared past 85% on Polymarket. The prediction platform recently gained traction regarding U.S. policies, including the last Presidential election. Users expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give applications the regulatory nod this year following recent events in the market. This became a major morale boost for traders due to the high chances of Polymarket predictions. A previous Dune Analytics study showed that the betting market had a 90% success rate. At press time, the prediction volume has soared past $55,000, while 42% of users back an earlier approval date of July 31. Similarly, digital asset enthusiast Nate Geraci wrote on X that a spot XRP ETF approval is just a matter of time, citing participation from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other firms. He added that the asset is the third largest by market cap, hinting that these top firms would not miss out on it. Several crypto users have toed the same line, stressing that the asset’s market cap and institutional demand place it next in line for approval. In Q4 2024, XRP flipped USDT to become the third-largest asset by market cap after it soared above $3. Institutional investors also increased their exposure to the asset following global partnerships coupled with its cross-border functionalities. At the time of writing, XRP gained 0.5% to trade at $2.14 in the past few hours. Aside from wider institutional adoption, the present regulatory environment in the United States has triggered a new wave of optimism. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC would drop its appeal against the firm after years of litigation. For most commentators, the Ripple v SEC lawsuit remained a setback for the firm in terms of institutional demand. Furthermore, the launch of a strategic crypto reserve in the United States and growing acceptance from traditional firms have heightened investor appetite.

Title: Shiba Inu Insider Explains Why SHIB Is Ready For Multi-Billion-Dollar Inflows From ‘SHIB ETFs’

Time Published: 2025-03-30T21:18:10Z

The debate over whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) is ready for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) continues to gain traction in the crypto space. Despite ranking as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and boasting over 110 exchange listings with 212 trading pairs, SHIB has yet to receive a proposed ETF in the United States. However, its community remains steadfast in pushing for recognition. On Sunday, Lucie, the lead marketing strategist for Shiba Inu, took to X to highlight SHIB’s readiness for an ETF and why even boomers could embrace the popular meme token. “SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms. It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF? YES. Will boomers invest in a ‘doggy coin’? Also yes,” Lucie asserted. She emphasized that SHIB is more than just a meme; it is a decentralized, community-driven asset built to last. One of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is its resistance to price manipulation. The pundit pointed out that to manipulate SHIB, one would need to be a billionaire, similar to Bitcoin. This characteristic differentiates SHIB from low-cap tokens susceptible to extreme price swings. Additionally, she highlighted SHIB’s decentralization as a critical factor in its ETF potential. Unlike projects that rely on central entities, SHIB continues to grow organically, with various teams building around it. She referenced Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including the core development team, Shibarium’s Layer-2 blockchain, and the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, as key innovations that bolster SHIB’s long-term sustainability. This is not the first time the Shiba Inu community has advocated for an ETF. In January 2025, Shibizens, a prominent SHIB community handle, published a detailed case for why major asset managers like BlackRock and Grayscale should consider launching a SHIB ETF. Their argument rested on ten key points, including SHIB’s massive global community, high liquidity, and operational success of Shibarium. The post quickly gained traction, with community members rallying behind the idea. Users voiced strong support and predicted a price surge for SHIB ecosystem tokens, such as BONE, SHIB, and LEASH. Shibizens also highlighted SHIB’s affordability, ESG-friendly initiatives through the Shib Karma Foundation, and potential for long-term institutional adoption. One of Lucie’s more interesting claims was that boomers could warm up to SHIB. While traditionally wary of volatile assets, older investors could find SHIB appealing due to its accessibility, decentralization, and expanding role in DeFi, gaming, and payments. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified on February 27, 2025, that most meme coins do not qualify as securities under federal law. This shift strengthens SHIB’s prospects for an ETF, potentially making it easier for older investors to enter the meme coin market.

Title: Elon Musk’s X and xAI ‘Intertwined’ in $45 Billion Deal

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence (AI) company has acquired his social media platform in a multibillion-dollar deal. The deal, announced by Musk Friday (March 28), values his xAI at $80 billion and X, the social media platform once known as Twitter, at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in a post on the social media site. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.” According to Musk, X now has 600 million active users. Data from those users has been used to train Grok, xAI’s artificial intelligence model. And premium subscribers to X can access some of Grok’s higher-end features. The news follows reports from last month that X was in talks to raise funds from investors at a $44 billion valuation, the same figure Musk paid for the platform in 2022. An investor in X told the Financial Times (FT) that getting back to the original purchase price has been a symbolic target for Musk. As that report noted, Musk loosened X’s moderation policies after taking over. That prompted an advertiser exodus, driving down revenues. Fidelity Investments, the report points out, has slashed the company’s value, saying in late September it was under $10 billion. However, many advertisers have returned, with Amazon recently increasing its spending as Musk forged stronger ties with the White House. Investors told the FT that X’s finances seem to be improving, with the company having posted $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year. That figure aligns more or less with the time just before Musk acquired Twitter, the report added, though one source said the number was subject to “significant adjustments.” Meanwhile, xAI and chipmaker Nvidia recently joined the $30 billion AI Infrastructure Fund, an AI infrastructure project backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the goal of raising up to $100 billion for the technology. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs.” Elon Musk's X and xAI 'Intertwined' in $45 Billion Deal Frank Founder Charlie Javice Convicted of $175 Million Fraud Experience Economy Meets Hollywood: Live Events Redefine Movie, Streaming Engagement Lululemon Offers New Products and Events to Draw ‘Cautious Consumer’ We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Cork Con seal their place as Division 1A play-off contenders with win over Ballynahinch

The make-up of the Division 1A play-off contenders has been decided with a round to spare after results contrived to ensure St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Constitution and Lansdowne will contest the semi-finals. Cork Con sealed their place thanks to a 28-5 win in a tough, hard encounter at Ballynahinch which ended the home side’s play-off hopes. Con had first use of a swirling wind and led 14-5 at half time thanks to tries by lock Eoin Quilter and tight head Luke Masters. Entering the final quarter, scrumhalf Adam Maher rewarded sustained pressure, and a try five minutes from time by the Ireland Clubs captain Jack Kelleher sealed a bonus point. That also sealed a play-off place ahead of next Saturday’s concluding game at home to Terenure, who suffered a fourth defeat in a row at home by 20-12 to Young Munster. A try by Evan O’Connell gave “Munsters” a 7-5 lead at half time after playing into the wind, and two second half-tries by another Munster player, Shay McCarthy, secured the win. St Mary’s ensured their semi-final place with a 40-12 win at home to City of Armagh and unexpectedly went top by dint of Garryowen’s gritty 19-18 win at home to Clontarf. Gordon Wood scored tries in either half as the Light Blues recovered from a 13-7 deficit to win through a Mikey Veale try converted by Dylan Hicks. Despite this Garryowen’s relegation was mathematically confirmed. Clontarf now need to beat St Mary’s at home next Saturday to ensure a home semi-final or else they could be overtaken by Cork Con. UCD remain two points adrift of City of Armagh in the relegation play-off place after their 25-7 loss at home to in-form Lansdowne, and have the tougher last game away to Young Munster, whereas Armagh host Ballynahinch. Nenagh Ormond sealed a home semi-final in the 1B play-offs with 21-17 win over third-placed Blackrock, who next host fourth-placed Old Wesley, while UCC could overtake the losers at home to champions Old Belvedere. Shannon’s 1B status hangs by a thread after their 34-5 loss to Old Wesley. The nine-time champions sit tenth and last, and trail Highfield and Trinity by five points ahead of next Saturday’s last round when Shannon host Queen’s, Highfield go to Naas and Trinity entertain Nenagh. Greystones overtook Corinthians on points difference in the final 2A play-off place by dint of beating the Galway side 45-15 at home. Wanderers secured the 2B title and promotion with a 42-7 home win over Clogher Valley, while Midleton will take a two-point lead into the final round ahead of Enniscorthy atop 2C.

Title: Ireland secure record-breaking eight-try victory over Italy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/30/ireland-secure-record-breaking-eight-try-victory-over-italy/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T16:52:37Z

A superb win and a great performance underscored by eight tries, there was plenty to celebrate for Scott Bemand’s team as they bounced back from their opening day defeat to France with an impressive victory in Parma. Ireland’s Aoife Dalton was a deserved player of the match, not only a try scorer, but also consistently excellent on both sides of the ball, making 15 tackles and nine carries. Although Ireland’s right wing Anna McGann might feel it’s not often that a hat-trick of tries is overlooked in handing out the laurels. There were others too that stood out. Stacey Flood added value every time she touched the ball, Eve Higgins had an eye for a gap, and outhalf Dannah O’Brien’s kicked brilliantly out of hand and off the tee, from which she landed seven from eight conversions. Up front the pack were excellent to a player, Aoife Wafer, Erin King and Linda Djougang especially prominent. Italy got off to the worst possible start as they lost their secondrow Valeria Fedrighi to a yellow card for a shoulder to the head of Ireland captain Edel McMahon after less than a minute. The subsequent bunker review adjudicated it should remain a yellow, but by the time she returned the home side had conceded 14 points. O’Brien kicked the penalty to touch. Ireland mauled the ball and after a couple of carries from the pack, pursued a wider option. Despite the fact that Higgins had her pass deflected, Dalton scooped up the ball and demonstrated speed and strength to force her way over. O’Brien’s conversion was unerring. It got even better for Ireland on seven minutes when Higgins deceived the defence with a dummy and accelerated through a gap. Both the timing and accuracy of her pass enabled Anna McGann to cross for her first try in Test rugby. The work of the Irish backrow at the breakdown was first class in the opening quarter, Wafer and King especially prominent, so too hooker Neve Jones. The Italians had served notice with some enterprising back play before scrumhalf Sofia Stefan profited from soft Irish defence to scamper over for a try. Ireland’s determination to drift without closing the space inside was costly. The visitors then dodged one or two more defensive lapses without conceding further points before Higgins, once again, cut the Italian defence asunder. Amee-Leigh Costigan still had work to do but accomplished it with a lovely in-and-out swerve to cross for Ireland’s third try. The fourth and bonus-point try was a brilliant team effort. Wafer and Djougang were direct and powerful to guarantee front foot possession, before fullback Stacey Flood glided on to the ball, straightened, and gave McGann the space to squeeze over in the corner for her second try. O’Brien kicked a superb touchline conversion, her fourth from as many attempts. A gutsy goal-line stand in the final moments of the half enabled Ireland to take a 28-5 interval lead. Wafer had a try disallowed soon after the restart Niamh O’Dowd pinged for blocking. Britanny Hogan and Dorothy Wall made an immediate impression off the bench, their energy and power conspicuous in the build-up to a deserved try for the hard-working Djougang. Unfortunately for the Irish tighthead prop her next involvement resulted in a yellow card, which stayed at that level of censure on review. It meant that Christy Haney had to come on for flanker McMahon. Hogan and Wall collaborated for Ireland’s sixth try on 64-minutes, the latter powering over from close range. O’Brien failed to convert for the first time. Italian centre Beatrice Rigoni was awarded a try after a TMO review, a strange decision on the basis that she didn’t get to her feet before playing the ball for a second time. Her right knee remained on the ground/back of the Irish player. She maximised her good fortune by adding the conversion, but it was merely window dressing in scoreboard terms. Given a glut of changes on both sides the contest lost a little of its shape as the teams struggled to maintain cohesion. Replacement scrumhalf Emily Lane might have added to Ireland’s tally, but lost control of the ball just shy of the Italian line following a sharp break. The visitors did get that seventh try, Hogan barging past a couple of lacklustre tackles, which O’Brien improved upon and with the last play of the match McGann grabbed her hat-trick, outflanking and outpacing the Italian defence. O’Brien’s conversion a fitting epitaph for a stellar placekicking display.

Posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a calculated consolidation of power under the guise of public health....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: leftism 1 posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Some conspiracy theories turn out to be true. 2 posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:35 AM PDT by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Title: ‘I was 34 and all my friends were having kids... I was like: what am I waiting for?’

Karen Heffernan wouldn’t know the father of her child if he passed her on the street. What she does know is what he looked like as a baby, his height, that he is Danish, and has a clean bill of health. That’s because when Heffernan, a 37-year-old hairdresser from Blackrock in Co Dublin was in her early 30s, she began to explore the idea of intrauterine insemination (IUI), using donor sperm. “I always knew I wanted a child, but my last long-term relationship ended when I was 25. I told myself, if I didn’t meet anyone I would be happy to have a child by myself, and then I hit 30 and gave myself two years to look into the option of using a donor properly. But then Covid hit,” she recalls. “That put a stop to socialising and going on dates. When restrictions were lifted I was around 34 and all my friends were having kids at the same time and I was like ‘what am I waiting for?‘” Before she went for the first consultation at a fertility clinic to discuss her options, Heffernan sat her parents Paula and Alan down to explain her plans. “I knew that taking this on as a single mother would require support. From the outset, they were 100 per cent behind my decision and my mum came with me for my first consultation,” she says. At a new Thérapie Fertility Clinic in Carrickmines, Heffernan was told of her options. Learning about women’s fertility and how rapidly it starts to decrease in their 30s, she knew she would be taking a chance on the donor route. She purchased three “straws” – three IUI rounds with the donor’s sperm, at a total cost of around €5,000. Under the Children, Family and Relationships Act (CFRA) 2015, which commenced in Ireland in May 2020, all imported donations – sperm or eggs – must be from a non-anonymous, or traceable, donor. Donors must agree to open contact with a donor-conceived child once that child reaches 18 years of age. “The donor was listed under the European Sperm Bank. In Ireland, there’s a lot of rules and regulations, so only three women in Ireland can use the same donor, and we can only use what is termed ‘open donors’, who can be contacted at a later stage by the child,” Heffernan explains. “I was only looking for a healthy, happy baby so that meant a donor [with] no health issues. It didn’t matter if they had brown or blonde hair, or [were] a boy or a girl.” [ The meaning of motherhood in a world that devalues, judges and polices itOpens in new window ] When her first attempt with IUI failed, Heffernan decided to go for a second round, but this time she kept what she was doing under wraps. In October 2022, she found out she was pregnant. “I live alone so I was sitting in my house in shock and happy-crying. I couldn’t believe it had happened for me so quickly. I hadn’t told my parents that I had gone for the second round It was my mum’s birthday on the day I was getting the blood tests to confirm my pregnancy, so I wrote on the card ‘Love from baby H’,” she adds. “When I told people I was pregnant, some would ask if I was going to say how it happened. My reaction was always, of course I will, because getting pregnant from a donor is nothing to be ashamed of.” In June 2023, her daughter was born. Heffernan sees her own family in the looks and traits of her child, now 21 months old, but has noticed some characteristics that are probably from the donor. “She’s quite a tall baby. Her skin is more sallow than mine too, but she looks like my family and she’s quite active in the way I was at her age.” Aimee Crinion wasn’t thinking about having children when she married her partner Dave in 2009. Then aged 32, and with both of them working full-time – she as a professional dog walker and he in IT – there was plenty of time to start a family, but first they would travel, enjoy plenty of nights out and long lie-ins. When the couple from Glasnevin in Dublin 9 decided to have children, they expected it to happen naturally. Except it didn’t. At 36, Crinion shared her concerns with her doctor and the couple subsequently opted for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to try to help them to conceive. Crinion knew there were no guarantees. I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that “We went for one round at the Merrion Fertility Clinic in Dublin 2, and in our minds we were thinking, we’ll do it once. We were baffled why I couldn’t get pregnant. We were both healthy and neither of us had fertility problems – I simply wasn’t getting pregnant naturally, even with an egg reserve that wasn’t bad for my age,” she explains. “We did our first round of IVF against a background of people telling us that it never works the first time, which I thought was really pointless advice. But they were right, it didn’t work and I was desperately upset because all of my friends were married and had children or were pregnant and it consumed me – all I could see were babies everywhere. And that was all I wanted, to bring a child into the world.” Crinion credits the strength of her marriage as the reason for getting through the first failed round. Dave was a constant support and they had each other at the end of it all. [ ‘When our last embryo failed, the clinic told us there was nothing more they could do for us’Opens in new window ] Crinion’s father Michael became very ill during the same period, and died in October 2013. It was an incredibly stressful time. “I found it so hard to lose him and not have been able to let him meet my kids because I always believed he would,” she says. In 2014, the couple decided to go for one last round of IVF. “I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that. I remember that day in May in the Merrion Clinic and one of the nurses there turned to me and said ‘this is going to work, you’ve done everything you can and I’m telling you, this is going to work’. She mentioned my dad, just a passing comment, and something felt different, almost like he was watching over me.” Having never done a pregnancy test herself for the fear of disappointment, one morning just after a blood test at the clinic while out walking her dogs, she took their call. “I was on Killiney Hill with six dogs running around me and all the clinic said at the other end of the phone was ‘yes’. I started screaming, ‘Finally, finally’. Me and all these dogs [were] running towards the car park to get to my van. It was magical,” she says. Her son Hugo was born in February 2015. Content with her life, Crinion still had the option to pursue IVF, but didn’t know if she could go through the process again. Two years after her son was born, she went to the doctor with a urinary tract infection (UTI). “I gave the doctor a sample for the UTI test and she said, ‘Do you know you’re pregnant?’ I couldn’t process that. I remember saying something like ‘Okay ... but can you give me something for the UTI’ and then very quickly adding that I couldn’t be pregnant because I couldn’t have children naturally.” Arabella was born in November 2017, and there was no question of IVF again. “I do consider myself lucky. I’m 50 now with two beautiful children, a husband, a dog, and a lot of grey hair. As difficult as that path was to get here, I am very grateful for it all. I do believe my father has watched over every step.” Having raised three birth children of her own, Mags Murphy from Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is now a foster mother. Since 2018, she and her husband Danny, who also have three grandchildren, have taken in 10 foster children over short and long-term periods, with ongoing check-ins with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and support from Foster Care Ireland (FCI), an organisation that places children with foster parents. There were 5,595 children in the care of the State last year, according to Tusla, with 91 per cent of those children in foster homes. For Murphy, these figures are heartbreaking. “All of these children deserve a parent, or a caring adult that can make a difference. They have done nothing wrong, and yet many carry this feeling of guilt that it was something they did,” says the 57-year-old. “Even when they come into care, the children try so hard to please. They ask, ‘am I being good?’ and you’re thinking, ‘you are a child of four or five, you shouldn’t be worrying about having to be good or trying to figure out what is expected of you from adults.’ It’s very, very hard on them.” Murphy says her house has always been a lively, loud, and busy home. Her children – now 31, 35, and 37 – often had friends over. For 30 years, she ran her own childcare business for preschoolers, and over a 10-year period had 12 children from Belarus stay at Christmas or during the summer months under the Chernobyl Children’s Project International, founded by Adi Roche. When they call you mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them A self-confessed nurturer, it was after her children left home that she and Danny began to discuss fostering. Following assessments, vetting and training, they were accepted, and in April 2018 got their first placement under the “respite fostering” programme, where a child already with foster parents would come for a weekend or a week to give them and their foster parents a break. “At first it was like I was a doting granny because I would take this little child in on a Friday and they would return to a foster parent on the Monday, and you could really have fun with them and take them places. You didn’t have to deal with homework or the stress of school and all that goes with full foster care,” says Murphy. [ Fostering: ‘The children’s situation is so precarious – while we may not have everything to offer, we offer everything we have’Opens in new window ] “You would also see their behaviours and ask yourself if you could deal with that on a daily basis. But then we got our first boy and he was with us for four years. He was really lucky because he was reunited with his mum. It was a happy story. That often doesn’t happen for children in foster care.” It has been a challenging experience at times, too, but FCI’s link workers have offered a lot of support to the Murphys over the years. Murphy has maintained contact with many of the children who stayed with her, and has framed photographs of them all on the wall in her home. Some of the children have referred to her and Danny as “Mam and Dad” when speaking about their new family in school or with friends. “When they call you Mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them,” Murphy says. “You also want them to become comfortable and confident enough to just be children.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
