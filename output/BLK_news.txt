By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Assets in actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) worldwide hit a record $1 trillion at the end of August, according to data provider ETFGI, boosted by easier regulations and a wave of product innovation. Active ETFs seek to outperform the indexes they are benchmarked to, including the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 1000 Growth Index. Bear Stearns launched the first active ETF in 2008. While they make up just 7% of all global ETFs, active ETFs have accounted for 30% of all inflows into the funds as a whole for the last several years, Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street (NYSE:STT) Research, told Reuters in the latest episode of Inside ETFs. A key growth catalyst, analysts said, was the 2019 regulation popularly known as the “ETF rule,” which streamlined the complex process of winning approval for active ETFs from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Assets in the active ETF category have grown about 10-fold since 2019, according to data from ETF.com. Growth has continued this year. As of Aug. 31, active ETF assets soared 42%, data from ETFGI showed. The more relaxed regulations have also fueled innovation, Bartolini said, encouraging issuers to take novel approaches to products as they vie for investor dollars. Active ETFs run the gamut from the plain vanilla, such as the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Large Cap Value ETF to more niche offerings, like the AdvisorShares Vice ETF, which invests in shares of companies involved in the alcohol, tobacco and cannabis industries. "These regulatory rule changes have actually accelerated some of the more novel approaches that ETF issuers can bring to the marketplace," Bartolini said. Active ETFs include products that have been wildly volatile, such as Ark Innovation ETF, which soared 152% in 2020, only to slump 23% the following year. So far in 2024, it has lost 9.74%, compared with a 20% gain in the S&P 500. Some can also magnify risk, such as leveraged ETFs tied to the performance of individual stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nor are all active ETF issuers faring well. The 10 largest issuers accounted for 75% of active ETF assets, according to a Morningstar report from earlier this year. The bottom half of active equity ETFs have only 3% of all the group's assets. "ETFs that repackage old-fashioned stock-picking have struggled to attract assets," said Jack Shannon, manager research analyst at Morningstar, in a report published on Tuesday. Tim Huver, senior vice president of ETF Servicing at Brown Brothers Harriman, said active ETFs may require investors to do more due diligence. Nonetheless, he believes the category has reached a turning point. A Brown Brothers survey found that more than 90% of ETF investors intended to increase their allocation to active ETFs, Huver said. "I think the second trillion is going to arrive much more rapidly than it took us to get to the first trillion," Huver said.

Title: Report: Connected TV Ad Platform MNTN Considering Early 2025 IPO
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2024/report-connected-tv-ad-platform-mntn-considering-early-2025-ipo/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T20:50:47Z
Full Content:
Connected TV advertising platform MNTN is reportedly considering going public in early 2025. The firm, whose chief creative officer is actor Ryan Reynolds, selected Morgan Stanley to work on its initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Friday (Sept. 27), citing unnamed sources. Deliberations around the IPO are ongoing, and details could change, according to the report. MNTN did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. The company’s advertising software includes targeting, measurement and automated optimization technology designed to help brands promote themselves on connected TVs, according to the report. In 2021, MNTN acquired Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort, and raised $119 million in a Series D financing round, per the report. The company’s Series D round closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and was announced by the firm in a February 2022 press release. The round was co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management and Research Co. MNTN said in the release that the number of viewers making streaming their preferred way of watching television had exploded, that large advertisers were moving to connected TV because of this growth in consumption, and that MNTN’s software enables advertisers to buy connected TV inventory and measure its performance in real time. Patrick Pohlen, chief financial officer at MNTN, said in the release: “I’ve worked in venture and technology for over 25 years but this company and our new partners are special. Connected TV is transforming the advertising landscape and MNTN is leading the charge.” In a blog post announcing MNTN’s acquisition of Maximum Effort, MNTN CEO Mark Douglas and Reynolds wrote that the combination brought together tech and creative to simplify and accelerate advertising. “We believe the meteoric rise of Connected TV presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring media and creative closer together,” they wrote. “The demand for easy-to-use tech and superb, fast-turn creative is certain to climb thanks to an increase in inventory and advertisers new to TV — many of whom can’t afford upfronts. Independently, our companies have embraced and excelled because of our commitment to simplicity and speed. Together, we think the opportunities are endless.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock Buys Massive Amount of Bitcoin

U.Today - As recently reported by Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) - the giant hedge fund with over $10 trillion in assets under management - bought more Bitcoin (BTC) this week than any ETF issuer has sold in the past three weeks. The purchases were made for BlackRock's own IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF and totaled the equivalent of $388.19 million over the past four days. As of today, the hedge fund's total cryptocurrency holdings amount to 362,193 BTC, or the equivalent of $23.79 billion. For comparison, this is over 100,000 BTC more than the amount held by the nearest competitor, Grayscale. There is no mystery behind such groundbreaking activity from BlackRock's side toward the major cryptocurrency. As the fund's head of digital assets recently revealed, for them, Bitcoin is not a risky gamble, but rather a scarce, global, decentralized, nonsovereign asset that has no country risk and no traditional counterparty risk. From the perspective of a $10 trillion asset management firm, BTC is more like digital gold than a beta to the NASDAQ and tech stocks in general. BlackRock's interest in cryptocurrencies does not end there, however, as the fund recently launched its spot Ethereum ETF solution. These ETFs have not seen the same hype as those focused on Bitcoin, but the number of ETH in BlackRock's wallet is growing regardless. It remains to be seen if we will see the appropriate level of acceptance for Ethereum from the financial giant, but at least the trend seems to be there.

Title: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman branded "podcasting bro" for his reportedly absurd plan to "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers" to fulfill his ambitious AI vision

Lack of sufficient computing power and AI chips limits AI advances, but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly has an "audacious plan" to bypass these issues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. While Generative AI allows significant tech corporations like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google to tap into new and unexplored opportunities, it demands a ridiculous computing power and cooling water. Reports indicate that the world could be on the brink of the most significant technological breakthrough with AI, but there won't be enough electricity to power its advances by 2025. Google and Microsoft consume more electricity than 100 countries to power their AI advances. Last year, we learned that Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT use up to 1 bottle of water for cooling per query. Recent research by the University of California further built on this premise, revealing that OpenAI's GPT-4 model (often considered mildly embarrassing at best) consumes up to three water bottles to generate a mere 100 words. OpenAI and Microsoft have openly highlighted their plans to address some of the issues preventing further advancement in AI, including investing $100 billion in a new project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overreliance on NVIDIA for AI chips. Microsoft recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams. Aside from looking at nuclear fusion as an alternative power source for AI advances, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly been curating an "audacious plan" to address the firm's computing power needs (via The New York Times). These plans are closely tied to investors in the United Arab Emirates and chip makers in Asia. According to sources with knowledge of Altman's ambitions, he reportedly pitched a multitrillion-dollar plan to investors, which would help build chip fabs and data centers worldwide. These plans would set OpenAI in a unique position to push its AI advances to the next level with unlimited computing power. As you may know, investors in the AI landscape recently raised concern over Microsoft's spending on AI efforts after its latest earnings call, citing difficulty in establishing a clear path to profitability in the category. Interesting;y, market analysts and experts claim OpenAI's reported bankruptcy claims in the next few months, with projections of $5 billion losses, are part of any startup's growing curve. With Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple lining up to participate in the ChatGPT maker's latest round of funding, pushing its market capitalization to over $150 billion, OpenAI could become the world's dominant AI company, given its unique enterprise and consumer position. As part of Sam Altman's plan to develop next-gen AI models, he'd require the United Arab Emirates to fund his ambitions by building multiple chip-making plants worldwide that cost up to $43 billion each. This plan would allow chipmakers like NVIDIA to meet the high demand for AI chips, especially in the Emirates, which has access to electrical power. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. To put Altman's plans into perspective, he told TSMC executives that it would "take $7 trillion and many years to build 36 semiconductor plants and additional data centers to fulfill his vision." According to a TMSC spokesman, the company is open to discussing expanding semiconductor development. However, it's more concerned about its current global expansion projects. TSMC execs reportedly found Altman's ambitions for AI absurd, branding him a "podcasting bro." An OpenAI spokesman responded to the claims that OpenAI pitches multi-trillion-dollar projects by refuting them and indicating that the firm isn't considering following that path for its AI ventures. What OpenAI is specifically exploring is on the scale of hundreds of billions," the spokesman added.

Title: Bitcoin climbs to $66,000, marking best September performance in history

The rally comes amid market optimism driven by the Fed's rate cut, economic stimulus in China and sustained demand from institutional players in the US. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $66,000 on Sept. 27 as New York opened for trading, reaching a two-month high to record its best September performance on record. The rally comes amid economic stimulus measures in China and the US Federal Reserve policy decision to cut interest rates, which have helped sustain recent market optimism. The surge is also driven by sustained institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to CryptoSlate data, Bitcoin was trading at $66,200 as of press time after bears failed to pull the price back to lower levels immediately after the surge. However, the ensuing trading hours have seen subdued momentum, with a pullback to retest support at $65,000 likely in the coming hours. Institutional demand played a significant role in Bitcoin’s latest rally, with major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments recording significant increases in their holdings following the rate cuts. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of $365 million this week, the highest in over two months, indicating a sustained appetite from investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. The demand for Bitcoin ETFs has surged as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets amidst economic uncertainty. Many institutions are positioning themselves ahead of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts expected later this year. Several other institutional players have followed suit, with hedge funds and pension funds increasing their allocations to Bitcoin amid a broader search for yield and diversification. The appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value has strengthened as inflationary concerns grow and traditional assets such as bonds deliver lower returns. The upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price has also been supported by developments in China, where a wave of economic stimulus measures has boosted confidence in global markets. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, providing further momentum for Bitcoin’s rally. The digital asset has mirrored these gains, rising over 3% week-to-date, as capital flows from both institutional investors and favorable macroeconomic conditions continue to push its value higher. As traders speculate on the possibility of another Fed rate cut in November, optimism has grown across global markets, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs alongside Bitcoin’s rise. The CME Group’s FedWatch Tool places the odds of another 50-basis-point cut at 52%, boosting hopes of further liquidity in the market. Lower interest rates are seen as favorable for Bitcoin and other risk assets, as they reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets and inject more liquidity into financial markets. With institutional demand remaining robust and macroeconomic conditions continuing to evolve in favor of risk assets, Bitcoin’s strong September performance could pave the way for further gains in October, a month historically positive for the crypto market. Analysts remain bullish, with some pointing to familiar patterns of strong price action following periods of institutional accumulation. As economic uncertainty persists and both central bank policies and global financial markets remain in flux, Bitcoin’s recent price movement highlights its evolving role as a key player in the financial landscape. At the time of press 6:32 pm UTC on Sep. 27, 2024, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.69% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.61 billion.

Title: Leaders That Mislead – Manipulators and the Manipulated

Time Published: 2024-09-27T17:29:48Z
Full Content:
In modern times, governments joined at the hip with the ‘world order’ of mega-corporations and mega-banks have lost sight of what is actually needed for the wellbeing of the population. For decades, various ‘world order’ type policies emanating from the likes of the United Nations (UN) and the World Economic Forum (WEF); and debt-packages emanating from private international banking have been adopted by national governments Worldwide supposedly for the wellbeing of the populace. We are told this is to save us: However, these policies and economic ‘bailouts’ that were launched are more like chains around the neck, or ‘boats of stone’ that are slowly sinking, taking the general populace down with them. This is evident in policies that affect the lives of almost everyone on the planet. Policies that invariably mean you have to pay for the ‘fixing of the latest concocted problem’, via a new tax, a new regulation, or a change in your freedom or lifestyle. Take for example policies based on the bogus science of CO2-induced or methane-induced climate change; including the nonsense that dairy farmers must reduce cow numbers to combat climate change (i.e. reduce methane emissions). As more small farmers go bankrupt due to increased expense and regulation, mega-corporations buy more land and increase their control of the food system, unleashing more genetically-modified foods, while local farming, local resilience suffers. Who can forget the fake Covid-19 pandemic, the lockdowns and mass injurious vaccination that ensued, see also the book No Worries No Virus. Then there is the ongoing deceptive United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals involving Agenda 2030, which dictates how the entire world population should live their lives, and which ideologies they must accept. See also this article. There is also the fact that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested (EROEI) for solar and wind energy is too low to be viable in most locations and scenarios, and therefore to repurpose and rebuild the world energy and industrial system to de-carbonise the economy is a waste of vast amounts of fossils fuels (no wonder the sector seeks subsidies). Despite decades of government subsidies wind power provides less than 5% of the world’s energy, and solar just 1%. Another deception is in relation to electric cars, see also the article Electric Cars are Fake Environmentalism. Electric cars are still driven by electricity produced from fossil fuels and will most likely continue to be. The manufacture of potentially hundreds of millions of new electric cars and electric car batteries involves a continuation of widespread mining and processing of rare earth metals, such as lithium, rhodium and cobalt, which are a limited resource. The mining and processing of rare earth metals has been shown to be polluting to land, air, and water systems, such as rivers. Furthermore, there are even instances of electric cars going on fire and exploding, due to battery issues or short circuits, see these videos The Shocking Truth About EV Fires You Need to Know and How to Survive an Exploding Electric Car. Society has also experienced decades of economic trickery via debt money banking, as well as fake science or perverse ideology being taught in schools worldwide, etc. Europe and the western world has also been subject to decades of increasingly unvetted mass immigration, and masses of so-called asylum seekers being funded and planted into European countries from faraway countries where there is no war at all. What could possibly go wrong? See also this article describing the conflict Over Hundreds of ‘Unvetted Migrant’ Centres Being Planted Throughout Ireland and the UK. For more details on these hoaxes and deceptions see also the books available here on the Reality Distinguished From Illusion website. The boats of stones are built by ulteriors hidden from the public eye, and launched by unelected institutions such as the UN and the World Economic Forum. Then big-salaried national and international politicians (‘Yes’ men of the institutional moneyocracy) tell the public they must climb aboard the stone boats or drown. (Who can forget the Covid lockdown and vaccination mandates purported to save us all from impending death). Upon closer inspection, one can see that the underside of the boat is made of stone, however, hardly anyone wants to dive into the water and look underneath the boat, because everyone else is walking up the gangway, and a loudspeaker is blaring “Come aboard – get your free vaccination here, and we have great finance deals on new electric cars”. “Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction are in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those whose who blindly follow them… those who mislead people go to hell… humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone” – Ancient Vedic scripture (Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 7 Text 14, translated from Sanskrit by Srila Prabhupada) While the mega-corporate elites enact material or political power plays that advance their economic domination and political power, much of the general populace becomes more confused, weakened, poverty stricken, controlled or frustrated by endless regulations or government policies. Yet, many are, understandably, reluctant to jump off the boat, or do not know how to swim, i.e. few people know how to live independently of the government and corporate ‘system’. Thus, almost everyone is dependent on the increasingly authoritarian and restrictive government ‘system’ that has been imposed upon them. I spoke with a local farmer recently who tells me he spends so much time doing nonsensical paperwork and spending money to meet ridiculous regulations that the profession is hardly worth his time anymore, and none of sons would consider taking on such a time- and labour-intensive profession. However, not all the people are fooled or manipulated by the manipulators. Those with a stronger consciousness see through the lies. Nothing significant occurs by chance in a corporate-controlled world. Without money, planning and organisation, none of the above events would be possible. It is a question of power. There are those who manipulate to advance a certain agenda or self interest, and those who allow themselves to be manipulated. This is most effective when the targeted people are not aware they are being manipulated. Voluntary cogs in the machine are easier to deal with than forced ones. Who were the key players or misleaders that promoted the climate crisis hoax? My books CO2 Climate Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Real Environment Movement and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability delve into this topic, including the role of the private banking sector, President Obama, Al Gore, various institutions, and academics. Linked to this agenda are the deceptive UN Sustainable Development Goals. Also aligned with UN climate change agenda is the World Economic Forum ‘reset’ agenda that was officially launched in 2020. The WEF reset agenda has been sold as a solution to the fabricated problems of climate change and Covid-19. This is the Hegelian Dialectic tactic: fabricate a problem to be perceived, foster a public reaction, and then provide the solution. The solution is actually the implementation of original objectives that would have faced public resistance, but now the policy or agenda can be implemented publicly as the ‘solution’ to the ‘perceived problem’. Modern day governments subservient to mega-corporations and private mega-banks, rather than the people they are supposed to serve, have also become morally degraded. In modern times, the fabricated matrix of economy, government, banking and corporate power is a reflection of a dominator culture. The entire ‘mainstream reality’ is made up by the so-called elites who own or control the mega-corporate media, mega-banks, and the mega-corporate industry. Via government funded schooling, TV shows, and corporate control of mass media we have been indoctrinated into a type of corporate-communist-consumer culture. We are meant to become dependent on the system, via the work treadmill or social welfare, pay more taxes, and be shackled to debt, rather than become independently self-reliant in our communities and local regions. Self-reliant communities are a threat to the control culture of the socalled ‘powers that be’. Furthermore, we have been trained into accepting that certain aspects of our society are untouchable truths that should not be debated. Life is focused around the pursuit of illusions fed by bogus mantras, such as “we must reach net-zero by 2050”, or “becoming rich will bring you happiness”. The masses are compelled to enter the treadmill of the ‘rat race’ and wake, eat, work, sleep, repeat, die, without ever examining we are actually here on Earth, or what our true purpose in life actually is. Obedience to institutions and ideas, which are not at all what they seem, is ‘expected’. Being manipulated means that one is, unfortunately, part of the manipulation, having accepted that role within a contrived social construction without questioning it. A social construction that twists reality in order to twist you. When we try to change the current system for the better by forming adversarial political movements and seeking votes, however well-intentioned this may be, we are actually playing into a rigged game in which the money masters or so-called elites always win. This is because in current times the entire political democratic system itself is a sham, a sort of punch and judy show for the masses. Notwithstanding the various valid issues facing the populace, both the so-called left and so-called right of the political spectrum are also to a large extent manifestations of a divide and conquer strategy. When one follows the money one may see that both ‘sides’ are typically controlled, funded by, or beholden to, the same orthodoxy of money masters, private bankers, or financial elites that control the economy and the debt money system itself. In the U.S., this was exemplified when President Obama, a Democrat, administered over a massive bailout of private banks (read orchestrated muti-trillion transfer to private banks) in 2010; and then President Trump, a Republican, administered a multi-trillion bailout (wealth transfer to asset management corporation Blackrock) in 2020, under cover of a fake pandemic. In reality both are beholden to, not the voters, but to a private banking cabal. The books Demonic Economics and Transcending the Climate Change Deception also cover this topic. Furthermore, President Obama has been a champion of the Climate CO2 Hoax; and President Trump has been a champion and supporter of the Covid-19 vaccines, which have been injurious to many people. Injuries due to vaccination are documented in many articles including this article by Professor Michel Chossudovsky The Covid “Killer Vaccine”; and in my book No Worries No Virus. While politicians pay well scripted lip service to their respective voter bases with powerful scripted speeches and sound bites, the voters, understandably desperate for a hero, are led to believe if their party can just win the next election then everything will be change. Meanwhile, ‘behind the scenes’ ulteriors that have the actual political power implement their plans to shape society, regardless of which party gets elected. The elections are just window dressing, or a mirage of change. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: These 5 Stocks Grew More than Bitcoin Over the Last Year
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/stocks-that-grew-more-than-bitcoin-8716756
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:44:00Z
Full Content:
While Bitcoin's 130% surge grabbed headlines this past year, a select group of stocks outpaced the cryptocurrency behemoth. AppLovin (APP), MakeMyTrip (MMYT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Powell Industries (POWL), and TG Therapeutics (TGTX) all rode waves of market demand to deliver eye-popping returns. These five companies found remarkable success in their sectors, from AI breakthroughs to fronting an industrial boom. Moreover, their stellar performance wasn't just a flash in the pan. Standing behind their stock price increases are robust fundamentals and impressive metrics like revenue growth and return on equity (ROE), which suggest these stocks could keep outshining Bitcoin, one of the most volatile assets. Below, we dig into how they did it. Over the past year, BTC has had one of its best years, more than doubling in price. This was driven by the start of trading for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), market sentiment, and other major financial catalysts. In late October 2023, BTC pierced the $30,000 level in a rally spurred by anticipation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the spot BTC ETFs. The approval of ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity significantly increased the institutional demand for BTC, increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. By January 2024, BTC's price surged to $49,000. There was also anticipation for the upcoming BTC halving event. However, the cryptocurrency didn't climb upwards all year. In late January 2024, BTC corrected, dipping 20% to a low of $38,500. This was only a pullback, and by mid-February 2024, the cryptocurrency had rallied past $50,000. The BTC spring halving was another major catalyst for the cryptocurrency, as halving events reduce BTC's supply by cutting mining rewards in half, usually leading to a spike in its price. By mid-March 2024, BTC reached an all-time high of $73,835, fueled by solid demand, particularly from ETFs. Despite this peak, BTC began consolidating, trading between $49,000 and $73,895 for the following months. In the preceding 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose 150%. The gauges for the stocks selected below are as follows: Below, we discuss the criteria further, but let's get to our analysis first: Among the top performers, APP led the pack with an impressive one-year return of 227.6%, supported by robust revenue growth of 37.3%. NVDA was close on its heels, delivering a 180.7% price return, kickstarted by extraordinary revenue growth of 194.7%. This was primarily thanks to surging demand in AI and data center sectors. TGTX stood out with its remarkable revenue growth of 1,341.6%, though its one-year price return of 160.1% was comparatively modest. POWL Industries and MMYT had consistent performance, with one-year returns of 179.7% and 182.1%, respectively. POWL's growth was particularly noteworthy at 44.8%. Regarding profitability and valuation metrics, NVDA emerged as a leader with an impressive return on equity (ROE) of 123.77% and a strong price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, indicative of its market dominance. TGTX was also quite strong, with a high ROE of 87.8%, though its P/B ratio at 21.0 was more modest. AppLovin's ROE of 70.7% was solid, but its particularly high P/B of 52.2 suggests investors are placing a significant premium on its expected growth. POWL appears lower in risk as a stock, given its P/B of 5.9 and steady ROE of 34.2%. MakeMyTrip rounded out the group with an ROE of 22.2% and a relatively high P/S of 14.4, reflecting a balanced growth trajectory and investors' optimism about its future in the expanding Indian travel market. AppLovin Corporation specializes in mobile app development and marketing products. The company provides a platform where developers can review metrics on their growth, work to increase user engagement, and review their mobile app revenues. AppLovin has demonstrated strong growth, with its stock price increasing by 228% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: AppLovin's high P/B ratio suggests that investors are placing a premium on the company's assets, likely because of its strong growth prospects and market position in the mobile app industry. That said, the company is in the highly competitive mobile technology sector. Its suite of tools and strong AI capabilities have positioned it as a leader in helping developers monetize their apps, particularly game developers. Holders of APP shares should be aware of potential risks: Despite these potential drawbacks, AppLovin's recent performance and strategic position have made it a standout in app development, allowing it to outpace even the impressive gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. MakeMyTrip is a major online travel company primarily serving the Indian market. Founded in 2000 and based in Gurgaon, India, the company offers the typically comprehensive range of travel-related services travelers expect from today's major platforms. MakeMyTrip has shown significant growth, with its stock price increasing by 182% over the past year. Several factors have driven this performance: MakeMyTrip is a dominant player in India's online travel space, benefiting from the country's large and growing middle class, increasing internet availability, and rising disposable incomes. The company's strong brand recognition and wide service offerings have helped it maintain a leading position in a competitive market. The company's high P/S and P/B ratios suggest that investors are optimistic about its future growth in the rapidly expanding Indian travel market. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, MakeMyTrip's strong market position and the robust growth of India's travel sector have contributed to its impressive stock performance, NVDA is one of the dominant companies producing advanced computer graphics processors, chipsets, and multimedia software. Founded in 1993 and based in Santa Clara, California, the company plays a significant role in AI, autonomous technology, and high-performance computing, helping to shift the evolution of visual computing and AI. NVIDIA has achieved record-breaking quarters recently, which has been driven by several key factors: NVIDIA is dominant in the GPU market, particularly in AI and high-performance computing. The company's technology is driving advances in many industries, including autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and scientific research. However, investors should be aware of potential risks: Despite these risks, NVIDIA's strong market position and growing demand for AI and high-performance computing products have contributed to its exceptional stock performance, outpacing even the significant gains seen in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin over the past year. Powell Industries, Inc., based in Houston, Texas, develops, designs, and manufactures custom-engineered systems and products for the energy and industrial sectors. The company is known for providing engineered products for electrical power infrastructure. Powell Industries has seen significant growth driven by several factors: The company's focus on custom products for critical infrastructure has helped it maintain a competitive edge. However, investors should consider the following risks: Despite these risks, Powell Industries' strong performance in recent quarters and its strategic position in essential infrastructure markets have contributed to its impressive stock performance. TG Therapeutics, Inc., founded in 1993 and based in North Carolina, is a biopharmaceutical company that acquires, develops, and brings to market therapies for B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. TG Therapeutics has had excellent growth, driven by several key factors: The company's focus on novel therapies for B-cell-mediated diseases positions it well in areas where critical medical needs are unmet. However, investors should be aware of the following risks: Despite these risks, TG Therapeutics' recent commercial success and strong pipeline have contributed to its impressive stock performance. In identifying the stocks that outperformed bitcoin in the past year, we used measures that would highlight companies with strong growth potential, financial health, and market performance. By focusing on the key indicators below, we pinpointed stocks that showed both impressive past performance and had the strength in fundamentals to continue their upward trajectory: Market Capitalization Greater Than $300 million (Small Cap and Higher) Companies with the market capitalization described above are established but still have significant potential for growth. Small-cap and mid-cap stocks often outperform larger companies because of their potential for rapid revenue growth while still being large enough to withstand some economic changes. This ensures that the stock is less prone to extreme volatility when compared with microcaps, which can be highly speculative. In addition, larger companies provide more liquidity, making buying and selling shares easier. TTM Revenue Growth More Than 25% Consistent high revenue growth is a crucial indicator of a company's ability to expand its market share, innovate, and meet consumer demand. Revenue growth of more than 25% yoy indicates that the company is rapidly increasing its earnings. Strong revenue growth often leads to growth in earnings and stock price increases. TTM ROE Greater Than 15% ROE measures a company's profitability relative to its equity. An ROE of over 15% is an excellent figure, showing that management effectively turns shareholder equity into profits. High ROE companies are typically well-managed, competitive, and able to reinvest earnings effectively. P/B of 5 and Above A high P/B typically signals that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's assets because they believe it will continue to generate superior returns. While a lower P/B is considered more value-driven, a higher P/B reflects increased expectations for growth and market confidence in the company's future performance. In high-growth stocks, a P/B of 5 or more suggests the company is well regarded for its potential. 1-Year Performance of More Than 150% A one-year price appreciation of over 150% demonstrates strong momentum, indicating that the stock has significantly outperformed the broader market. High performance over a year is often driven by strong earnings, revenue growth, and positive investor sentiment, all of which are necessary when selecting stocks that could outpace BTC's gains. Investors should focus on strong and consistent revenue growth and profitability metrics such as return on assets and ROE to identify stocks that may outperform cryptocurrencies like BTC. You should also review valuation ratios that show market confidence in future growth, such as high P/E or P/B ratios. Targeting industries with disruptive potential, such as AI or green energy, and selecting stocks with strong momentum and positive analyst reports are also worthwhile when selecting high-growth investments. Indeed, investing in stocks that could outperform BTC carries several risks, such as above-average market volatility. Valuation risks can also arise when stocks with high P/Es or P/Bs become overvalued. Industry-specific risks, such as regulatory challenges in sectors like technology and biotech, may hinder growth. In addition, stocks are sensitive to economic shifts like changes in interest rates and inflation. Company-specific or idiosyncratic issues, such as poor management or legal challenges, increase risk, requiring investors to look carefully before investing and diversifying their portfolios once they do. To diversify an investment portfolio with stocks and cryptocurrencies, investors should pick their holdings based on risk tolerance. Most investors will want to hold much of their portfolios in stable blue-chip stocks and other safer assets, with only a small portion for volatile cryptocurrencies. Over the past year, APP, MMYT, NVDA, POWL, and TGTX have had exceptional growth, outpacing even the stellar 150% rally in bitcoin's prices. Key drivers for these companies include strong revenue growth, high ROE, and market momentum. NVDA, in particular, capitalized on AI demand, while TGTX succeeded with its Briumvi therapy. APP and MMYT leveraged strategic new products, and POWL benefited from industrial sector growth, positioning these stocks as strong performers with robust fundamentals across very different sectors of the economy.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $66K as it records its best September in history

Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:15:16Z

Share this article Bitcoin surged to $66k today, setting a fresh two-month high and marking its best performance ever in September. This rally comes as global economic factors and institutional demand combine to drive the token price upward. Bitcoin’s price increase mirrors the sharp rise in Chinese stocks, fueled by China’s recent economic stimulus measures. The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its best week since 2008, thanks to the stimulus, which also boosted BTC by 3% week-to-date. “This feels frighteningly familiar,” commented trading resource The Kobeissi Letter on the sudden market rise. In the US, the FED’s recent 50-basis-point rate cut, announced on September 18, provided further momentum. The S&P 500 has set repeated all-time highs following the announcement, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print for August met market expectations. The next Fed meeting in November could see another rate cut, with the odds of a 50-basis-point cut standing at 52% according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, further fueling market optimism. Institutional demand remains strong. BlackRock has purchased more Bitcoin this week than any ETF has sold in the past three weeks. Positive inflows continue across other institutions offering Bitcoin ETFs, with yesterday’s ETF inflows reaching $365 million—the highest in over two months. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) will be released from jail today. With China printing money, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, and institutional interest at an all-time high, Bitcoin’s strong September could pave the way for continued bullish action in October, which has historically been the best month for Bitcoin.

The rise in capacity would be necessary to address the expected growth in consumption as the current capacities are already being optimally utilized, Crisil Ratings noted. “Most of the capacity addition would be brownfield expansions to cater to demand for end products, thus lowering the project risks,” said Adds Joanne Gonsalves, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings. “Further, the sector benefits from its strategic importance to the government”. Over the past decade, India’s domestic consumption of petroleum products rose by 4% per year, with transport fuels, accounting for around 56% of consumption, growing by 4% each year, according to Crisil. “We expect overall petroleum product consumption to slightly moderate and register ~3% CAGR over the next six years, primarily due to slower growth of 2-3% in transport fuel consumption,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings. India will drive up to 35% of global energy demand growth over the next 20 years, petroleum minister Hardeep Puri said at the Gastech conference in Houston last week. “If you say that global demand is increasing by one percent, ours is increasing by three times that,” Puri said. “In the next two decades, 35% of the increase in global demand will come from India.” By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Pemex Oil Output Dips as Outgoing Mexican President Fails to Bolster State Giant Next Post WTI Houston Crude Prices Gain Prominence as U.S. Oil Exports Jump Charles is a writer for Oilprice.com More Info Saudi Arabia Cuts Oil Prices Oil Net Short For First Time in History Africa’s Top Refinery Could Soon Upend Global Gasoline Markets Chinese Refineries Go Bankrupt Amid Plummeting Margins The Refining Supercycle Is Coming to an End ADVERTISEMENT Oil Prices Plunge on OPEC+ Production Cut Speculation Oil Prices Set for Monthly Decline as Demand Concerns Grow Analysts Cut Oil Price Forecasts for Fourth Consecutive Month Solar Cars: The Next Big Thing in Green Transportation? © OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

The milestone comes after the $9 trillion asset manager recently acquired another $35 million worth of Bitcoin and $6.4 million of Ethereum earlier this week. With the latest acquisition, the asset manager’s Ethereum reserves now stand at 350,000 ETH, worth around $989 million, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are managed primarily through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which allows institutional investors direct exposure to Bitcoin. BlackRock's holdings now represent approximately 1.70% of the total available Bitcoin. BlackRock’s recent acquisitions have set it apart from other major asset managers, particularly Grayscale, which currently holds around 258,671 BTC valued at $16.45 billion. However, Grayscale continues to hold a stronger position in Ethereum, with over 2.104 million ETH valued at roughly $5.45 billion—more than five times that of BlackRock’s current Ethereum holdings. On Sept. 25, BlackRock saw a surge of $184.4 million in inflows into its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the highest single-day inflow of any fund during the month, according to Farside data. This influx came shortly after the Federal Reserve’s decision to reduce interest rates by 50 basis points—a move that has been a focal point of the financial markets throughout 2024, potentially influencing crypto investment and sentiment. While BlackRock’s increased crypto investments signal growing institutional interest, some observers have raised questions about the physical custody of these assets. Rumors have circulated online alleging that Coinbase, the exchange serving as a custodian for BlackRock and several other Bitcoin ETF issuers, is not acquiring the actual Bitcoin requested by the funds but instead issuing "paper Bitcoin" or IOUs. Baldilocks here. Not sure what this is all about TBH. All ETF mints and burns we process are ultimately settled onchain. Institutional clients have trade financing and OTC options before trades are settled onchain. This is the norm for all our institutional clients. All funds… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 14, 2024 To address these concerns, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to clarify that all transactions involving the ETF are settled on the blockchain. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas further confirmed that BlackRock maintains its own blockchain node and consolidates its Bitcoin balances nightly, which are then reported to Coinbase Prime.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows cross $365.7 mln – Did China help?

What is driving the recent surge in Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin’s price? After facing weeks of uncertainty, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are once again gaining momentum. Despite September’s bearish reputation for BTC, both the cryptocurrency and its associated ETFs have defied expectations with a trend reversal. As of the most recent data on the 26th of September, total inflows for all Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive $365.7 million. Leading the charge was Ark’s ARKB with $113.8 million, followed by Blackrock’s IBT at $93.4 million. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded $74 million, while Bitwise’s BITB sits at $50.4 million. VanEck’s HODL, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin’s EZBC also contributed inflows of $22.1 million, $6.5 million, and $5.7 million, respectively. Although two more smaller ETFs showed modest inflows below $5 million, the overall surge underscores the renewed investor confidence in BTC ETFs. Notably, on the 25th of September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, witnessed an extraordinary surge of $184.4 million in inflows for its spot Bitcoin ETF, making it the highest single-day inflow of the month for any fund. This spike comes amid growing market speculation, potentially influenced by developments in Asia. For those unaware, Chinese stocks rallied following reports that the Chinese government may inject up to ¥1 trillion($142 billion) into its major state banks, aimed at boosting an economy that has faced challenges recently. Earlier in the week, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) took easing measures by cutting the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points and lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. These actions have seemingly fueled optimism, which may be playing a role in the inflows seen in global markets, including Bitcoin ETFs. Remarking on the matter, Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, said, Source: Ki Young Ju/X He further added, “The U.S. is regaining dominance in #Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand. Only known entities are included.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Meanwhile, on the price front, BTC’s price action has shown remarkable resilience. After struggling to break past the $60,000 barrier for days, the leading cryptocurrency surged, reaching $65,642. This marked a 2.89% gain in the last 24 hours. As the month draws to a close, Bitcoin has exhibited a strong bullish trend with an impressive monthly rise of 10.98%, signaling sustained upward momentum in the market.

"We now have a Labour government whose number one priority is wealth creation," U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive broadcast interview Thursday. "We are a Labour party that is proud to say we are pro business just as much as we are pro worker." In July, Starmer became the first leader from the center-left Labour party to win a U.K. national election since Tony Blair — ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Since being elected, he has said his top priority is economic stability. During his visit to New York City amid the United Nations General Assembly, Starmer met with business leaders including Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Blackstone President Jonathan Gray. This week, Blackstone committed to investing $13 billion to build a data center in the northeast of England. The investment aims to create 4,000 jobs and lead to one of the largest data centers in Europe to power the surging demand for artificial intelligence. "It's a big signal of confidence," Starmer told Sorkin about the deal. "It's also in the northeast of England, which matters to us, because I want economic drive outside of London." Starmer said the industries in particular he's working to attract investment in include renewables, artificial intelligence and life sciences. This call for investment comes as the Labour government is getting ready to unveil its budget plan in October, while dealing with a stagnant economy. Starmer's government, in the early days of its tenure, flagged a £22 billion ($29 billion) financing shortfall after his administration performed an audit. Former Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, for the Conservative Party, in July wrote to Simon Case, the head of the British civil service, labeling Labour's claims about the public finances "deeply troubling." Starmer has, more recently, been accused of being too negative on the U.K economy, and Labour's plans to ax the U.K.'s non-dom tax regime has also been criticized. "We will stabilize the economy," said Starmer Thursday. "There are going to be more hard decisions to be made when it comes to the budget." Earlier this week, Starmer's plan to cut payments that offset fuel costs for pensioners was rejected by his own party in a symbolic vote at the Labour Party's Annual Conference. "No one wants to change the winter fuel allowance for pensioners. But by doing that, we stabilize the economy," Starmer told Sorkin. "We can commit to what we call the triple lock, which means that they get more money year-on-year." The U.K.'s "triple lock" is where the state pension rises each year by either 2.5%, the inflation rate, or earnings growth — whichever is highest. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record best day since July with $365 million inflow

Ark's ARKB ETF leads with $113.8 million inflow, marking a significant turnaround. On Sept. 26, Bitcoin ETFs recorded substantial inflows totaling $365.7 million, marking the highest single-day inflow since July 22, when $530 million entered the market. According to Farside data, Ark’s ARKB ETF led with $113.8 million, marking a significant shift after recent outflows seen earlier this month. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF added $93.4 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC ETF reported inflows of $74 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF also saw strong participation with $50.4 million, and VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $22.1 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC reported smaller additions of $6.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued its trend of outflows, losing $7.7 million, while its smaller BTC ETF gained $2.9 million. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows of $0.1 million, continuing the recent trend of mixed investor sentiment in the Ethereum space. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw the most significant movement with outflows of $36 million, contrasting with BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $15.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. Inflows were also recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW, Invesco’s QETH, and 21Shares’ CETH, albeit in smaller amounts. Other funds, including those from VanEck and Franklin, remained relatively flat. The contrasting flows highlight evolving trends. Bitcoin ETFs attract substantial inflows across major funds, mainly driven by Ark and BlackRock, while Ethereum ETFs face continued outflows, primarily from Grayscale. The flows coincided with Bitcoin also breaking $65k for the first time since August. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: BlackRock Highlights Bitcoin’s Unique Properties as Approved IBIT Options Could Cement Risk-Off Status
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/blackrock-highlights-bitcoins-unique-properties-believes-btc-is-risk-off-in-the-long-term/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T09:51:00Z
Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock released a report last week, titled "bitcoin as a unique diversifier." The investment giant identified four key points from the report. First, how to analyze bitcoin (BTC) in relation to traditional financial assets due to its fundamental properties, such as not having a quarterly earnings report or a CEO. Second, bitcoin's high volatility can be perceived as a "risky" asset, which contributes to the discussion that whether it is a "risk-on" or "risk-off" asset. The token could be considered a flight-to-safety option because it is scarce, non-sovereign, and decentralized. Lastly, BlackRock pointed out that the long-term adoption of bitcoin may come from global instability. Bitcoin's realized volatility continues to trend downwards over time, indicating increased stability. In the early years of bitcoin, its realized volatility used to trade over 200%; however, as the asset matured, so did the volatility. Since 2018, realized volatility has not exceeded 100% and is currently at 50%. As realized volatility decreases and liquidity increases through financial instruments such as the spot and futures market, this may bring in more sophisticated investors such as options traders. This seems to be on the horizon with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. BlackRock also asked the question: Is bitcoin risk-on or risk-off? While short-term trading may suggest that bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, the data reveals a different narrative over a longer time horizon. According to data from bitcoin custody service Unchained, "almost all holders (99%+) are in profit if they held for just three years. All bitcoin holders in this class are in profit if they held for at least 5 years". We can see this type of mentality on-chain among investors, where over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for more than one year, according to Glassnode. This trend suggests that many investors tend to hold bitcoin because they believe in its store-of-value narrative and view it as a risk-off asset, even though bitcoin has faced multiple 20% corrections in 2024. BlackRock also showed that bitcoin has a very low correlation to U.S. equities. A graph shows the trailing 6-month S&P 500 correlation with bitcoin; the average correlation is 0.2 since 2015. Sometimes, assets will trade near one-to-one with one another due to external macro factors, most likely in risk-off or liquidity events. The report notes, "These episodes have been short-term in nature and have failed to produce a clear long-term statistically significant correlation relationship." Continuing with the theme of having a long-term time preference, BlackRock noted that bitcoin tends to outperform other risk-on assets after 60 days following a major geopolitical event. The U.S.- Iran escalation in 2020 saw bitcoin return 20% after 60 days, outperforming gold and S&P 500. This was also the case for Covid-19, the 2020 U.S. election challenges, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. regional banking crisis, and most recently, the Yen Carry trade unwind on Aug. 5. During the recent Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which was now 53 days ago, major assets experienced declines on the day. However, bitcoin has risen by 22% since then, with gold and the S&P 500 up roughly 11%. Edited by Parikshit Mishra.

Title: Google to invest $3.3 billion building two data centers in South Carolina
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-invest-33-billion-building-two-data-centers-in-south-carolina/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T07:52:02Z

Google has announced its plans to invest $3.3 billion in two new data centers in South Carolina. The news comes as rivals, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing heavily in infrastructure upgrades for use in AI, as they provide the necessary computing power, data storage, and network connectivity, all essential for processing vast amounts of data efficiently. Out of the $3.3 billion, a significant portion of the investment, $2 billion, will be allocated for campuses at Pine Hill Business Campus in Ridgeville and Winding Woods Commerce Park in St. George. The other $1.3 billion would be used to expand Google's existing data center in Berkeley County and is expected to create 200 operational jobs in the region. Google is not the only big tech company that is expanding its data centers. Microsoft recently announced a massive $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure which includes building data centers, energy projects, and more, in partnership with BlackRock and an investment firm. Google is itself investing €1 billion (around $1.1 billion) in expanding its data center in Finland and $2 billion in an AI data center in Malaysia. Amazon is also investing $11 billion in new data centers in Indiana and even includes four solar farms and a wind farm, with a combined capacity of more than 600 MW for the data center's energy needs. Energy demand is likely to soar as big tech companies continue to build and expand energy-hungry data centers across the globe to meet their AI capabilities. However, they are likely to be run on green energy in the near future. A notable example is Microsoft's recent announcement to revive the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. The facility, infamous for a significant nuclear accident in 1979, will now supply 835 megawatts of power to support Microsoft's data centers, as the company aims to run all its data centers on clean energy by 2025.

Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings. Can it surpass Satoshi Nakamoto by year-end? After a period marked by minimal activity, BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBIT) has regained momentum, recording substantial inflows starting on the 23rd of September. Notably, on the 25th of September, IBIT saw an impressive influx of $184.4 million, while the total inflow across all Bitcoin ETFs amounted to $105.9 million. In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC, which usually experiences outflows, reported zero movement on the same day. However, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark’s ARKB experienced outflows of $33.2 million and $47.4 million, respectively. This resurgence in ETF activity has propelled the U.S. BTC ETF to an astounding $17.944 billion in inflows for 2024, marking a record-breaking year-to-date accumulation of 916,047 BTC—only about 84,000 BTC shy of the coveted 1,000,000 BTC milestone. Seeing this impressive growth, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst took to X and noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, is estimated to hold approximately 1.1 million BTC, a figure that institutional BTC ETFs are rapidly approaching. Recent data indicates that these ETFs have now accumulated about 83% of Satoshi’s holdings, and if the trend of increasing inflows continues, it could soon surpass him. Currently, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the list of the top Bitcoin holders, closely trailed by Binance with 673,783 BTC. Notably, major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale collectively hold a significant 901,101 BTC through their ETF products, with individual holdings of 359,271 BTC, 287,153 BTC, and 254,677 BTC, respectively. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In contrast, the remaining five asset managers with BTC ETFs possess a combined total of just 14,946 BTC. Sharing a similar line of thought was Spencer Hakimian, Founder of Tolou Capital Management who said, “ETF’s going to be bigger than Satoshi by Christmas Day.” Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, ranks sixth with 252,220 BTC and is on a path to potentially join the top tier of Bitcoin holders. Thus, as BTC ETFs continue to capture attention, Bitcoin itself has seen a resurgence in price. After facing challenges in breaking through the $60,000 barrier, BTC was trading at $64,358, reflecting a modest increase of 0.91% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Rebound as BlackRock Acquires 2,913 Bitcoin (BTC)

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock made headlines by purchasing 2,913 Bitcoin, worth $184.3 million. This marked their highest single-day acquisition in September. The news shows a renewed demand for Bitcoin, especially in the exchange-traded fund (ETFs) market. With this purchase, BlackRock solidified its position as the leading Bitcoin holder, surpassing other firms. BlackRock’s latest acquisition represents a significant shift in market dynamics. The firm now holds a total of 359,279 BTC, valued at approximately $23 billion. This amount far exceeds holdings by other firms like MicroStrategy, which has 107,059 BTC less than BlackRock. This massive investment also signals a rebound in the Bitcoin ETF market. The U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs debuted in January, sparking a wave of demand. Bitcoin ETFs recorded a massive single-day inflow of $1.05 billion in March and a total net asset of $62.5 billion in June. However, the market saw a decline in demand during July. Interestingly, recent trends show that inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have picked up again. According to Farside Investors, BlackRock’s $184.3 million Bitcoin Purchase contributed to $105.8 million in single-day inflows for U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BIBT) experienced positive inflows that day. BIBT saw a net inflow of $2.07 million, while other funds like the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) sold 525 BTC, worth $33.2 million. Also, the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) offloaded $47.41 million in Bitcoin. Other issuers, such as Grayscale, reported zero inflows. Amid these developments, an X user shared that the 30-day flow indicator for Bitcoin ETFs has turned positive. This is a welcome change after a period of negative trends, and it shows that issuers have seen an average net inflow over the past month. #Bitcoin spot ETF demand has rebounded, with the 30-day net change in total holdings turning positive. pic.twitter.com/c0C8BaFPDq — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) September 26, 2024 These funds have received new money for five days, totaling almost $500 million. Additionally, they have received more money in nine out of the last ten days. “The U.S. is regaining dominance in Bitcoin holdings. Its ratio compared to other countries is rising, driven by spot ETF demand,” says Ki Young Ju. Historically, the U.S. has dominated Bitcoin holdings among public firms. The recent surge in inflows has helped restore that dominance, which had dipped due to previous lackluster performance. The renewed interest in the market is evident in BTC’s price. On September 25, Bitcoin declined to $62,700. However, after this BlackRock purchase, BTC’s price has now been around $64,000. Also, BTC is trading above its 50-day and 200-day SMA lines, suggesting a bullish sentiment. Looking at its chart, BTC is closer to breaking its primary resistance at $64,700. A cross above this level will boost the bullish momentum in the market. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) CEO Lisa Su Announces That Their Next Phase Would Not Be A Transition Away From GPUs But Rather A Broadening Beyond Them

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss. AI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds. Tom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor manufacturer. Lisa Su, the CEO of the firm, recently said that graphic processing units (GPUs) might not be the architecture of choice for companies working on AI within the next five years because they did not offer the level of programmability tech firms wanted. The CEO was contextualizing earlier statements in which she said that GPUs right now were the architecture of choice for large language models, because they were very efficient for parallel processing. Su further noted that the next phase would not be a transition away from GPUs but rather a broadening beyond them. Custom AI chips, tailored to company-specific AI tasks, are already gaining traction in the tech world, highlighting the broadening away from GPUs. Overall AMD ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Pendle Foundation, BitMEX Co-Founder Moving PENDLE To Binance—What’s Going On?

PENDLE, the native token of Pendle, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, may be steady at press time. However, looking at CoinMarketCap data, the token is up 130X from its November 2022 lows and 41% from all-time highs registered in 2024. As prices cool off, there are emerging concerns. According to trackers, the Pendle Foundation, tasked with promoting the RWA platform, has been offloading tokens. At the same time, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, one of the first crypto perpetual trading platforms, is selling. Specifically, over the last three weeks, a big chunk of PENDLE transfers have been moved to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, a net negative for sentiment. On September 16, the foundation’s governance wallet moved 600,000 PENDLE worth over $2.4 million to Binance. Over the past year, the wallet has moved 3.72 million PENDLE worth over $11.95 million to Binance. Meanwhile, Spot on Chain has also picked out transfers from Hayes. On September 24, the BitMEX co-founder deposited 240,000 PENDLE worth over $958,000 to Binance. Over the last four days, Hayes has moved more than $6.5 million of the token to Binance. Hayes is one of the PENDLE whales. Although there is no direct proof that the former BitMEX executive has been selling, moving tokens to Binance could signal his intention to sell. Currently, Hayes owns over 253,00 PENDLE worth nearly $990,000. This holding represents around 4% of his overall crypto portfolio. Despite the exchange transfers, the token continues to shake off Q3 2024 weaknesses. Buyers are back in the equation after sinking to as low as $1.7 in early August. At press time, the token is up 100% from August lows, and buyers are bent on reclaiming the April 2024 highs at around $7.2. For the uptrend to remain, buyers must hold steady above $3.5, or August highs, and sustain the current upside momentum. Looking at the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB–a volatility indicator–suggesting that the underlying momentum is strong. If buyers build on this, PENDLE could register fresh all-time highs, incentivizing more whales to HODL. Currently, CoinMarketCap data shows that over 58% of all tokens in circulation is held by whales. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

Title: EXCLUSIVE: Investment Giants Leveraged Red State Universities’ Endowment Funds To Back Anti-Oil Agenda, Report Finds

Several asset managers leveraged two major Texas university systems’ endowment funds to advance anti-fossil fuel shareholder proposals in 2022 and 2023, according to a report from the conservative watchdog group American Accountability Foundation (AAF). BlackRock-owned Aperio Group, Cantillon, former Vice President Al Gore-chaired Generation Investment Management, GQG Partners and JP Morgan Asset Management collectively manage approximately $4 billion for The University of Texas/Texas A&M Investment Management Company (UTIMCO) as of July, which handles the university systems’ endowments. Despite the company’s policy against it and Texas’ status as the leading crude oil and natural gas-producing state, UTIMCO’s asset managers backed over 150 shareholder resolutions under the environmental, social and governance (ESG) umbrella, including proposals that could undermine the oil and gas industry, according to documents AAF obtained through a public records request and shared exclusively with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Once again, woke ESG ideology has infected a public institution and hijacked its money for their own purposes. This is an outrageous betrayal of the public’s trust,” AAF president Thomas Jones told the DCNF. “[Republican Texas] Gov. Greg Abbott must take immediate action to end this nonsense. He must shake up the leadership at UT/A&M that let this happen and use his influence with UTIMCO to ensure that it never happens again.” UTIMCO told the DCNF that the ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related votes violate “a long-standing policy that prohibits using the endowments’ economic power to advance social or political agendas” and that a review found they consist of 0.3% out of around 45,000 proxy votes in recent years. The endowment manager added that it has since modified its guidelines after finding the violative votes and will impose them on all of its third-party investment managers before future proxy votes, and revoking voting authority for those that cannot follow them. 🚨EXCLUSIVE🚨Swing State’s Pension Funds Used By Wall Street Titans To Push ‘Racial Equity’, Climate Agenda, Report Finds from @jasonJournoDC https://t.co/LXx3y4WZPV — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) January 25, 2024 The company’s asset managers voted in favor of a total of 159 shareholder proposals between them that include “racial and gender pay gap reports, efforts to defund conservative candidates and pro-business trade associations, radical climate policy, targeting of gun purchasers, and proabortion initiatives,” according to the watchdog. UTIMCO oversees the largest public endowment fund in the U.S., managing over $76 billion as of Aug. 31. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Swing State’s Pension Funds Used To Advance ‘Racial Equity,’ Climate Initiatives, Report Finds) “UTIMCO’s mission is to ‘generate superior long-term investment returns to support The University of Texas and Texas A&M University Systems,’ yet these votes endorse political agendas that run contrary to the Systems’ best interests,” American Energy Institute CEO and former Republican Texas state Rep. Jason Isaac told the DCNF. “By supporting proposals that harm American energy producers, UTIMCO’s fund managers are violating their fiduciary responsibility.” Texas leads the nation in crude oil and natural gas production and in 2023 was responsible for 43% of crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, AAF found many examples of UTIMCO’s asset managers voting in favor of proposals aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions and other actions to mitigate so-called climate change, which the watchdog alleges comes at the expense of producing value for investors. For instance, at ExxonMobil’s May 2023 yearly shareholder meeting, Aperio Group voted in support of a proposal to recalculate its GHG emissions to account for the assets it has sold. The resolution asserted that “the economic risks associated with climate change exist in the real world rather than on company balance sheets” and argues that the investments ExxonMobil sells may lower emissions on paper but that they fail to actually help achieve the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by 1.5 degrees Celsius — which is an objective of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement — potentially exposing the company and its stakeholders to what it calls “climate risk.” Some of Aperio Group’s clients have access to customize their individual proxy voting policy, according to BlackRock. BlackRock itself voted against this ExxonMobil proposal on behalf of most of its clients. AAF’s “report on UTIMCO’s investment practices should alarm every Texan who values our state’s proud oil and gas industry,” Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian told the DCNF. “It’s outrageous to see Texas university investments being used to support radical ESG agendas, decarbonization, and dangerous policies like Net Zero and the Paris Accord, which threaten our energy independence and economy. We must put an end to the woke political agendas that undermine the very foundation of Texas’ success and ensure our investments align with the values of hard-working Texans.” Moreover, at defense contractor Raytheon Technologies’ yearly shareholder meeting in May 2023, J.P. Morgan Asset Management backed a proposal urging the company to publish a report on efforts to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement. “Raytheon Technologies creates significant carbon emissions from its value chain and is exposed to numerous climate-related risks,” it states. “Failing to respond to this changing environment may make Raytheon less competitive and have a negative effect on its cost of capital and shareholders’ financial returns.” Isaac told the DCNF that UTIMCO’s “managers are discriminating against fossil fuel” companies through ESG investing based on the definition of “boycott” in Texas’ Senate Bill 13, which Abbot signed in 2021 and the former representative said he helped create. The bill defines boycotting energy companies as refusing to engage or ending business with a company involved in fossil fuels “without an ordinary business purpose.” It also specifies actions aimed “to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with a company because the company” does business related to fossil fuels and fails to “pledge to meet environmental standards beyond applicable federal and state law.” Isaac added that the asset managers “should be held accountable and placed on Texas’ list of “financial companies that boycott energy companies,” which mandates Texas public investment entities subject to SB 13 “avoid contracting with, and divest from, these companies unless they can demonstrate this would conflict with their fiduciary duties.” The S&P Global Clean Energy Index, which includes companies that engage in energy production from renewable sources, has fallen about 7% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 Energy Index, which features many oil and gas companies, has risen close to 3% in that same time. Louisianans’ pension funds were similarly leveraged to push climate-related proposals within publicly traded companies, the DCNF reported in April, based on another public records request by AAF. “UTIMCO’s asset managers’ apparent promotion of leftist objectives, including ESG, is extremely troubling and contrary to Texas law banning boycotts and discrimination against fossil fuels. The legislature must exercise oversight and hold UTIMCO accountable,” Republican Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison told the DCNF. “Governmental bodies, including their proxies, should not pursue objectives that harm the Texas economy and go against our values.” Cantillon, GQG Partners, Texas A&M and Abbot’s office did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

The financial consulting firm tapped the services of the qualified investors-focused tokenization platform AmpFi.Digital. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

Guggenheim Treasury Securities (GTS), a subsidiary of financial consulting firm Guggenheim Capital, has issued $20 million worth of Digital Commercial Paper (DCP) on Ethereum. The DCP received a P-1 credit rating from Moody’s. According to a Sept. 26 statement, Guggenheim will issue the paper via a blockchain platform developed by Zeconomy called AmpFi.Digital, which offers tokenization services for qualified investors. Zeconomy CEO Giacinto Cosenza stated: “With tens of billions of dollars locked in DeFi and corporate treasuries, we are thrilled to partner with GTS to address a clear need for more trusted and secure blockchain solutions.” The move comes as the tokenized US treasuries market surpassed $2 billion in market cap, with the participation of traditional finance heavyweights such as asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. BlackRock’s tokenized fund BUIDL has a market cap of over $513 million, while Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX trails close with $435 million. Additionally, AmpFi.Digital stated in the announcement that it aims to address key decentralized finance (DeFi) challenges such as poor credit quality, high fees, and compliance issues. Cosenza added that the approval of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the US and the substantial growth in the tokenization market this year highlighted institutional demand for crypto. Notably, nearly $1.6 billion of all tokenized U.S. treasuries are issued using Ethereum as an infrastructure. In addition to BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo’s USDY and OUSG and Hashnote’s USYC significantly increase the blockchain’s participation in the tokenized government securities ecosystem. Moreover, CoinDesk reported on Sept. 25 that Visa plans to create a platform that will help institutional firms issue fiat-backed tokens. Ethereum’s infrastructure will also power the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP). Solana holds just 5.5% of the tokenized US government securities market as of Sept. 26, with $122.7 million in tokens issued on the network. However, Franklin Templeton and Citigroup recently announced they are eyeing Solana for their next financial products exploring blockchain technology. During Solana’s ecosystem-focused event Breakpoint, Franklin Templeton revealed its plans to launch a mutual fund natively on Solana. Meanwhile, Citi is considering tapping the network for money programmability through smart contracts aimed at cross-border payments.

The SEC Chair will "certainly" not maintain his role under a Trump government, but a Harris presidency might also end his term. Howard Lutnick claimed that regulators have "no idea what they are talking about" when is comes to define crypto. The FBI affidavit reveals that Iza allegedly used fake warrants and intimidation tactics to exploit his victims. Despite breaking the $65,000 area this afternoon, Bitcoin still needs to hold its price above it to confirm the bullish sentiment. SEC Chair Gary Gensler reaffirms Bitcoin's non-security status while criticizing industry non-compliance amid SEC scrutiny. Analysts highlight the convergence of Bitcoin and altcoin momentum as a promising sign for broader market recovery. A decline in Solana DeFi ecosystem incentives is likely driving the fall of PayPal's stablecoin from $1 billion to $712 million market cap.

Title: Why Solana Is Poised To Smash $330 Price Milestone And Capture 50% Of Ether’s Market Cap
URL: https://zycrypto.com/why-solana-is-poised-to-smash-330-price-milestone-and-capture-50-of-ethers-market-cap/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T21:33:41Z
Full Content:
According to data from CoinGecko, among the top ten major cryptocurrencies by market value, Solana (SOL) has registered considerable gains over the past seven days (7.5%), even surpassing Bitcoin’s 1.8% growth. According to VanEck, at press time, SOL is trading for $155 and appears ready to extend its bullish momentum to hit $330 and reach 50% of Ether’s market capitalization. In a Sept. 25 report, VanEck’s research department, MarketVector, noted that Solana has beaten Ethereum in several important areas. For instance, the report’s authors observed that Solana has a high throughput and can process thousands of transactions per second, which is roughly 3,000% higher than Ethereum’s TPS. Moreover, Solana boasts 1,300% more daily active users than Ether, and its transaction fees are “5 million percent cheaper”, making it a more efficient and scalable network. The report highlights decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and payments as key areas where Solana can challenge Ethereum. Solana’s ability to transcend Ethereum in terms of speed and costs gives it an edge in the fast-growing sector. “Another major use-case is lending and borrowing within the DeFi space, a sector expected to continue growing at a rapid pace. Payments and remittances also hold massive potential, especially with Solana’s lower fees and faster transaction times. If institutions and everyday users can save money through cheaper, faster transactions, Solana’s user base could grow even more rapidly”, VanEck stated. The authors wonder why we haven’t yet witnessed a massive exodus toward Solana from Ethereum, particularly from institutions, despite these impressive SOL statistics. In terms of institutional adoption, Solana trails behind its older rival, which won further validation in July this year when United States regulators gave the nod to nine spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Although demand for these ETH instruments is rather lackluster, the approval indicates that institutional investors now have more appetite for ether. The landscape around a U.S.-listed spot Solana ETF, remains in limbo. While other countries, like Brazil, have already greenlighted such products, BlackRock execs recently asserted that “it will be a while before we see” a SOL ETF in America. Nonetheless, the VanEck analysts observed that retail investors are “slowly waking up” to Solana’s potential to challenge Ethereum’s status as the smart contracts king. VanEck further pointed out that Solana’s market cap remains only 22% of Ethereum’s. The report attributes this huge gap to Ether’s first-mover advantage and the wider institutional trust brought on by the ETFs. However, the researchers believe these advantages won’t guarantee Ethereum’s reign forever. Solana should focus on its strengths to ultimately close this wide gap. Meanwhile, the report suggested that Solana is grossly undervalued owing to its technical achievements and could potentially reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap. Should this materialize, the price of SOL could rocket to $330, given ETH’s present price and market cap of $2,635 and $315 billion, respectively.

Season of Discovery Phase 5 allows players to venture into the Blackwing Lair and Zul’Gurub raid dungeons, collect new Tier 2 armor sets, and more— all waiting for you to discover. In the dark recesses of the mountain's peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of different dragonflights with horrific results. Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon. Step into Blackwing Lair as a reimagined 20-40 player raid dungeon with a host of new mechanics including a swappable difficulty system allowing you to engage in greater challenges by activating new raid-wide effects based on each of the five dragonflight’s unique abilities. Leave no raider behind. Tuned as a 20-player encounter, players can bring additional friends to the adventure, with up to 40 players! As you make your way through the depths of the lair, keep a sharp eye out for some additional drops and their rewarding discoveries. Similar to Tier 1 sets from the Molten Core raid, Tier 2 armor sets are expanding to include multiple variations for different talent specializations and playstyles. The alternate versions of these new Tier 2 sets have new appearances and increased stats from the previous version of the Tier 2 sets and utilize Tier 1 set bonuses. This allows players more options to choose from when selecting the gear they would like to use while fine-tuning their playstyle. Players can also exchange Firelands Embers from the Blackrock Eruption event by visiting with Lokthos Darkbargainer in Blackrock Depths for elemental essences. Pix Xizzix now has additional new items such as Tier 2 bracer tokens for all classes available to purchase along with relics for druids, paladins, and shaman. Deep within the jungles of Stranglethorn, an ancient troll city full of untold peril awaits. Do you have what it takes to delve into its mysteries? Assemble a band of hardy explorers and make your way to Zul’Gurub, a max-level, up to 20-player raid instance with many epic items to procure from its verdant tree-lined avenues and lost temples. Zul’Gurub invites 10-20 players into this raid dungeon. Rewards and difficulty are tuned for 10, with room for 20 to join in the hunt for treasures untold. Players will be able to earn updated and redesigned rewards. Hakkar also offers new encounter mechanics and rewards for defeating him while all Zandalari Priests alive. Defeating Zandalari Priests now also grants access to buffs from powerful loa spirits like Hethiss and Shirvallah. Players will need to figure out the best route through Zul’Gurub to maximize the the effectiveness of these powerful spells. Players may also manually choose which boss they would like to face in the Edge of Madness Encounter. To fight a specific boss, click on their specific tablet and activate the brazier with Gurubashi Mojo Madness while the aura is active. In Season of Discovery Phase 5, many rune abilities have their discoveries streamlined to allow players to more easily complete those discoveries and obtain their runes. Pix Xizzix in Booty Bay now also makes bind-on-account tokens available for characters who have finished certain shared discoveries such as the Dark Riders, Wild Gods, Ley Lines, or Illari Duskfeather. Simply purchase the relevant emblem and mail it to an alt character to redeem at a special Rune Broker in Stormwind and Orgrimmar for their appropriate class rune. We have more discoveries for you to make in Phase 5, including new class-specific items for every class to find. For now, our lips are sealed on more details. The new phase ushers in additional Honor updates along with an increase to PvP ranks over time beginning with the release of Phase 5, allowing characters to continue earning ranks above rank 10, to a new cap of 13. Players earn more honor in battlegrounds along with gaining more honor with Marks of Honor turn-ins, and will earn slightly more Marks of Honor from losses in Warsong Gulch and Arathi basin. Queue restrictions for Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin are also removed, so that players can get into these battlegrounds faster. Season of Discovery Phase 5 adds a few other surprises in the form of a new raid boss and new dungeon boss, complete with all new loot! We look forward to seeing you engage with these new encounters. Good luck and may your blades never dull and your mana bar be plentiful!

Title: Bitcoin Peaks At Highest Value In 2 Months Above $65,000: Bull Run Predictions
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-peaks-at-highest-value-in-2-months-above-65000-bull-run-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T19:00:09Z
Full Content:
For the first time in nearly two months, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $65,000 mark, marking a significant recovery following two notable downturns in August and September. During these crashes, Bitcoin experienced a steep decline of 20% on two separate occasions, specifically on August 5 and September 6. However, as October approaches—a month often associated with a bullish resurgence for Bitcoin—market predictions are increasingly optimistic, suggesting that the cryptocurrency might be gearing up for another major uptrend. On Thursday, Bitcoin recorded a 3% increase within a 24-hour period, reaching a price of $65,500. This upward movement has sparked discussions among analysts about whether this signals the start of a parabolic bull run. Crypto investor Scott Melker expressed this sentiment, emphasizing that Bitcoin is currently attempting to establish its first higher high since peaking at $74,000 in March of this year. Melker noted that closing above $65,000 would confirm a new upward trend, transitioning from the lows of $50,000 observed in August. This pattern—a low, high, higher low, and higher high—suggests a bullish market structure replacing the previous bearish trends. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, with analysts like Lark Davis pointing out that the average return during this month is approximately 22.90%. If Bitcoin were to experience a similar increase this year, it could potentially rise to around $79,000, surpassing its previous all-time high and overcoming key resistance levels. Such a move would set the stage for a powerful rally into November according to Davis’ analysis. In a further analysis, Rekt Capital provided insights into Bitcoin’s recent performance. He noted that September, often viewed negatively, turned out to be the best September for Bitcoin on record, with a 9% increase. Rekt also highlighted historical patterns related to Bitcoin’s Halving cycles, indicating that Bitcoin typically breaks out from its re-accumulation range approximately 154 to 163 days post-Halving. Currently, Bitcoin is 159 days past its last Halving that took place in April of this year. Based on previous cycles, Rekt believes that this timing suggests that a breakout could be imminent, reinforcing the idea that Bitcoin is well-positioned for significant gains in the near future. The current resurgence can be attributed to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) dovish stance and recent 0.50% basis point (bps) interest rate cut on September 18, which was seen as a notable bullish catalyst not only for BTC but also for the broader market, which has followed Bitcoin’s performance to the upside in recent days. In addition, last week saw a resumption of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF market, following steady outflows throughout August and early September. For instance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs had a total net inflow of $106 million on Wednesday, continuing their net inflows for 5 consecutive days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF had an inflow of $184 million. Overall, there seems to be a combination of bullish catalysts in place for the market’s largest cryptocurrency to continue its recovery, with massive gains expected in the last half of the year and early 2025.

Full Content:
Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has recently increased its stake in the company with the purchase of additional shares valued at over $312,000. The investment firm, known for its active management in closed-end funds, executed the buy transactions on September 24 and 25, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The transactions involved the purchase of 9,482 shares at a price of $7.54 each, followed by an additional 31,988 shares at $7.52 per share. This price range reflects Saba Capital's continued confidence in the BlackRock-managed trust, which focuses on innovation and growth opportunities. Following these purchases, Saba Capital Management's holdings in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust have risen significantly. The firm's investment moves are closely watched by market participants, as Saba Capital is recognized for its strategic positions in the market. BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, trading under the symbol NYSE:BIGZ, is a term trust that aims to provide growth and income to its investors by investing in a portfolio of equity securities. The trust's performance and management strategies have attracted the attention of institutional investors like Saba Capital Management. Investors and market observers often look to the buying and selling activities of major shareholders for insights into a stock's potential direction. The recent purchases by Saba Capital Management could be interpreted as a positive signal for the trust's future performance. The disclosure of these transactions provides transparency and allows investors to make informed decisions based on the actions of significant shareholders. As BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust continues to operate within the dynamic innovation sector, the investment decisions of firms like Saba Capital Management will remain under scrutiny for indications of market trends and confidence levels. In the wake of Saba Capital Management's increased stake in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), it's noteworthy to examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that could shed light on the company's current market position and future prospects. With a market capitalization of $1.7 billion, BIGZ appears to be a sizeable player in the trust space. An attractive feature for investors is the trust's substantial dividend yield, which stands at 13.85% as of the last recorded date, indicating a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. The trust's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is currently at 7.87, which may suggest that the stock is undervalued compared to industry peers, especially when coupled with a high dividend yield. This could be part of the rationale behind Saba Capital Management's recent share purchases. Additionally, the trust's performance over various time frames presents a mixed picture, with a one-week total return of -1.45%, but a more positive one-year total return of 23.71%, reflecting longer-term investor confidence. InvestingPro Tips for BIGZ indicate that while the trust pays a significant dividend to shareholders, it also suffers from weak gross profit margins and a valuation that implies a poor free cash flow yield. These insights might be particularly relevant for investors looking to balance the immediate income generation potential with the long-term financial health of the trust. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available for BIGZ, which can be accessed for further strategic investment considerations. The comprehensive tips on InvestingPro could provide valuable context for understanding both the opportunities and risks associated with investing in BIGZ.

Share this article Ethena Labs, the startup behind the synthetic USDe dollar, has announced a new stablecoin called UStb that will be fully backed by BlackRock’s on-chain BUIDL fund. The move expands Ethena’s stablecoin offerings and aims to provide additional stability options for users and exchange partners. https://x.com/ethena_labs/status/1839259051030630757 UStb will function similarly to traditional stablecoins, with its reserves invested in BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The BUIDL fund itself holds US dollars, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, providing a stable backing for the new stablecoin. According to Ethena, UStb will exist as an independent product with a different risk profile compared to USDe. While USDe is a synthetic stablecoin that maintains its $1 peg through cash-and-carry arbitrage, UStb aims to offer a more traditional stablecoin structure backed by real-world assets. The company stated that UStb can support USDe during challenging market conditions. Ethena’s governance structure allows for the reallocation of backing assets from USDe to UStb when needed, potentially mitigating risks associated with negative funding rates. “UStb can also help USDe better weather difficult market conditions,” Ethena Labs claimed in a press release. “During periods of negative funding, the company can close hedging positions underlying USDe and reallocate its reserve assets to UStb.” Ethena plans to list UStb on centralized exchanges like Bybit and Bitget, where USDe is already used as margin collateral. The addition of UStb will provide exchange partners with a choice between two distinct products for margin collateral, potentially broadening the adoption of Ethena’s stablecoin solutions. Following the announcement, Ethena Labs’ ENA governance token experienced a significant price surge. Over the past 24 hours, ENA’s price increased by approximately 14%, climbing from $0.307 to $0.378. Trading volume also saw a notable uptick, reaching around $196.1 million. However, the market capitalization of USDe, Ethena’s flagship product, saw a slight decline of $13 million to $2.54 billion on the day of the announcement. This decrease comes after USDe had previously surpassed $3 billion in market cap in June. The introduction of UStb represents Ethena’s continued efforts to innovate in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The company aims to transform Ethereum into a crypto-native yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystem that operates independently of the traditional banking system. Ethena’s approach involves leveraging delta-neutral strategies, on-chain custody, and derivatives to manage volatility and improve scalability and stability. The addition of UStb to its product lineup demonstrates the company’s commitment to providing diverse stablecoin options for users and exchange partners in varying market conditions. Earlier this month, Ethena suffered a frontend attack, although its team has confirmed that no funds were harmed or stolen, with the damage limited to its user interface.

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Paul Singer’s Elliott Management, a hedge fund known for its aggressive activist tactics, is diving deep into office real estate, going into contract for $450 million to buy an office tower in Miami’s financial district, Bloomberg reported. The building, 701 Brickell, is home to some of the biggest names in finance, including Apollo Global Management, BlackRock and Point72 Asset Management. Last year, Pura Vida, a popular fast-casual chain, opened a 5,000-square-foot cafe on the ground floor. In April, Nuveen Real Estate put 701 Brickell up for sale, seeking $500 million. JLL is brokering the sale of the 32-story high-rise. The New York-based investor purchased the 1.1 million-square-foot tower for $172 million in 2002, according to property records. If the deal closes, it would mark Miami’s largest office sale this year. In 2023, Nuveen sold 801 Brickell, a nearby office property, for $250 million. Elliott Management, which moved its headquarters from New York to West Palm Beach in 2020, has been making inroads in Miami real estate this year. The firm and Adi Chugh launched Tyko Capital, which has emerged as one of the city’s largest lenders in recent months, providing $565 million to refinance the 830 Brickell office building and $527 million to build the St. Regis-branded luxury condo complex, also in Brickell. The district’s office asking rents — which average $93.73 per square foot, the highest in Miami-Dade County — have jumped since the pandemic hit, thanks to a slew of high-profile, new-to-market companies that set up shop. Asking rents also got a boost from the arrival of 830 Brickell, which is nearing completion and set a new benchmark for rates. Representatives for Nuveen and Elliott Management did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Bitcoin options interest "has been building mostly around the round figure of $100,000," Geoffrey Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailed comments. "Notably the build out has come at a more rapid pace than can be explained just by the fact that bitcoin prices are higher. Indeed the jump in open interest at the $100,000 strike that has come this week indicates something else is driving participants." The bitcoin price rally comes after U.S. vice president and 2024 Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris said that if she wins the White House in November, she would "encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting our consumers and investors," according to a Bloomberg report of a Wall Street fundraiser. "The most likely, from a timing perspective, is vice president Harris' comments on Sunday where she said she would encourage crypto businesses. These comments suggest either outcome on 5 November will end up being bitcoin positive," Kendrick wrote, pointing to the bitcoin and crypto market leading "the pack in terms of performance for the first time in a while" following the Fed's historical interest rate cut last week as evidence of growing positive sentiment. Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will surge to $125,000 per bitcoin if former U.S. president Donald Trump wins the election but will still climb to $75,000 if Harris wins. Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, promising to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if he's elected and backing his a crypto project led by his sons Don Jr and Eric.

Harris' muted endorsement of crypto failed to spur much support from the crypto community, with Galaxy Research's Alex Thorne posting to X that he doesn't "see any material difference from Harris (or her advisor Brian Nelson a few weeks ago) that offers cause for celebration."

Title: Aid to Ukraine is Hurting Europe. Irresponsible Pro-Ukrainian EU Trade Policy Destroying Bulgarian Agribusiness. European Farmers Going Bankrupt
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pro-ukrainian-trade-policy-destroying-bulgarian-agribusiness/5868745
Time Published: 2024-09-26T16:05:25Z

The irresponsible policy of aid to Ukraine is hurting Europe in every possible way. It is not only the arms shipments that are causing harm to EU nations, but also the current trade rules that prioritize Ukrainian products in order to expand “economic cooperation” with Kiev. Farmers’ dissatisfaction is only going to get worse and worse, paving the way for a major crisis in the future. Bulgaria has begun to show its dissatisfaction with the EU’s pro-Ukrainian trade policies. The country’s government has asked the European Commission to adopt a new resolution proposing to ban Ukrainian chicken eggs from the European market. The measure is intended to protect the European market from cheap Ukrainian products, ensuring the participation of native farmers in the commercial competition. Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Georgi Tahov said during a meeting with the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels that Bulgarian farmers are having severe difficulties competing with Ukrainian products, as the latter have “invaded” the European market at low prices and in massive quantities. This not only jeopardizes the economic stability of the Bulgarian agricultural sector, but also threatens to bankrupt thousands of farmers, leading to unemployment and social crises. Ukrainian eggs are causing controversy and are a particularly sensitive topic in the current European scenario. Egg production is one of the main activities of Bulgarian farmers, who have always had strong support from the state and the local market to maintain stable production levels. However, since the beginning of the special military operation, the EU has adopted an irresponsible policy of easy import of Ukrainian products with the alleged aim of boosting Kiev’s economy. As a result, Ukrainian eggs, which are 30% cheaper than Bulgarian ones, have simply “invaded” the European market. Ukraine exported more than 2,600 tons of eggs in the first half of 2024 alone. This figure is already five times higher than in the corresponding period last year, and an even greater rise is expected for the coming months. As a result, Bulgarian poultry producers are going bankrupt, and a big number of farmers are abandoning their activities due to lack of profit. “[This situation] puts serious pressure on prices on the domestic market (…) We firmly support the people of Ukraine, but this should in no way cause bankruptcies and violate the rights of our farmers,” the Bulgarian minister said. This is not the first time that demands have been made for changes in European import policy for Ukrainian goods. Since 2022, there has been strong pressure from European farmers to review the rules that facilitate the purchase of Ukrainian food products. Just as the Bulgarian egg sector is being affected, producers of grains, meat, milk and other items are going bankrupt in several European countries. The crisis affects countries from the most eastern areas, such as Poland and Bulgaria, to the most Western, such as the Netherlands, Germany and France. Farmers across the entire European continent are suffering from the EU’s irresponsible attitude of favoring Ukraine. The strong protests by farmers have led to expectations of changes in the trade situation. A report published by the Financial Times in June predicted that the bloc would resume tax obligations on Ukrainian products. However, the current tax exemption rules will remain in place until at least the second half of next year – which is enough time to bankrupt thousands of European farmers. In the same vein, it is unlikely that the European Commission will approve the Bulgarian request, given that most European officials are currently in favor of maintaining all policies supporting Ukraine, no matter how irresponsible they are. For the EU, the impact of anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian policies on European citizens is not important. The only thing that really matters is maintaining the levels of aid to Kiev, regardless of the consequences. It must also be emphasized that this process is a real “ticking timebomb” for the entire European food stability. While European farmers are going bankrupt to favor Ukrainian agribusiness, Ukrainian arable land itself is being handed over to Western private investment funds, such as Blackrock, as a method of payment for NATO’s billion-dollar support. In a few years, Europe will not be able to count on either its own production or Ukrainian products, entering a major supply crisis and dependence on imports – while having to impose sanctions that limit imports. Consciously or not, EU decision-makers are creating a problem that will not be solved so easily. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Solana And Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/amorsexton/2024/09/26/solana-and-ethereum-how-these-cryptocurrencies-stack-up-in-2024/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T15:24:04Z
Full Content:
Solana and Ethereum: How These Cryptocurrencies Stack Up In 2024, Part 1 In 2008, Bitcoin Bitcoin was introduced as the world's first provably secure peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. Ethereum Ethereum , announced in 2014, built on Bitcoin’s vision by allowing developers to create their own decentralized applications on a blockchain. Solana Solana , conceived in 2017, was built to address Web3’s scalability challenges, enabling high throughput and low-latency transaction processing at scale. Both Etheruem and Solana have been built to solve problems faced by the previous generation of blockchain technology. Both have also gone from zero to one in bringing new infrastructure to market, unlocking novel use cases, and driving adoption across Main Street and Wall Street alike. But how does one protocol compare to the other in 2024? Today, let’s look at how Ethereum and Solana stack up across three categories: institutional adoption, scalability, and liquidity. Institutional Adoption In 2024, institutional adoption has been driven in part by newly introduced crypto exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S, providing a regulated and accessible way for investors to add digital assets to their portfolios. Most recently, Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, with funds from major institutions such as Blackrock and Grayscale. This followed the successful launch of eleven Bitcoin ETFs in January, after approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). By August, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust was the first to surpass $1 billion in net inflows. The debut of both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has paved the way for a potential Solana ETF. Solana ETFs are not currently listed in the U.S., although they are available in some international markets. There are, however, applications under review by the SEC, with VanEck being the first American company to file for a U.S. Solana ETF, and 21Shares also submitting an application. It has been reported that the SEC rejected the 19b-4 filings submitted by Cboe BZX on behalf of the two institutions, raising a question around the deadline for an ultimate decision on a Solana ETF. Staking is notably excluded from Ethereum ETFs, leading some to believe a Solana ETF would follow suit, Solana also being a Proof of Stake blockchain. If so, this would indirectly transfer value to those who stake both SOL and ETH through each respective protocol’s inflation rate, meaning those who self-stake or choose to stake with a third party would receive more value from their staking. Scalability Both Ethereum and Solana pursue a vastly different, yet equally ambitious, scalability roadmap. Today, the Ethereum network faces throughput limits, with transactions ranging from 15-30 per second (TPS). These transactions are bundled into blocks, which are then processed by validators. Ethereum scalability relies on a strong Layer 2 (L2) ecosystem, a roadmap it has pursued since 2020. In March 2024, Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade was launched, introducing proto danksharding and dramatically reducing fees for L2s. These L2s, such as Optimism Optimism and Arbitrum Arbitrum , are separate blockchains, fully compatible with Ethereum, that take transaction load off the main network. L2 solutions have grown in popularity due to their high speeds and low fees, with institutions, such as Kraken, Sony, and Coinbase, as notable examples looking towards L2s for a number of use cases. Solana is faster than Ethereum, with a theoretical max of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), and it aims to be even quicker. Yet historically, Solana’s mainnet has had to overcome some uptime challenges. Firedancer, a Solana validator client built by Jump Trading, aims to deliver up to a theoretical TPS that is orders of magnitude higher, while improving reliability. Built from the ground up, Firedancer uses a concurrency model, borrowed from the low latency trading space, with high performance implementations of Solana’s core primitives. Firedancer’s testnet, Frankendancer, is a combination of Agave, developed by Solana Labs, and Firedancer. At this year’s Solana Breakpoint, Frankendancer was announced as live on mainnet, with Firedancer live on testnet. Liquidity Liquidity is important for an efficient Web3 economy, as it determines how quickly assets can be traded without impacting price. Trading volumes on Solana have historically been much lower than Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or more. However the speed and low-fee properties of Solana has led to a recent catch up, when Solana trading volumes briefly surpassed Ethereum (July and August 2024). Both ecosystems see real-world use cases and tokenization, particularly with stablecoins which are prime trading assets, has strong drivers for increased liquidity. Staking also impacts the levels of liquidity in both Ethereum and Solana, as both ETH and SOL require tokens to be locked in order to stake. Today, only 28% of the overall supply of ETH is staked, yet liquid staking has claimed the top spot in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. Liquid staking provides stakers with a Liquid Staking Token (LST) of their assets, one which is available to hold, trade, or participate in DeFi. The availability of liquid staking solutions is key to Ethereum’s economy: without a centralized marketplace, buyers and sellers must provide liquidity in pools to allow for assets to be bought, sold, and swapped across DEXes and DeFi platforms. Liquid staking providers, such as Liquid Collective, allow greater capital efficiency for stakers wishing to receive rewards, while also giving them the liquidity to participate in Ethereum DeFi. Similarly, liquid staking has become the largest portion of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, yet lags behind Ethereum significantly. The total market cap of staked Solana tokens is $57B. However, the market cap for liquid staking tokens is $3.8B, a liquid staking ratio of 6.60%. Conclusion While Ethereum holds a lead in terms of deeper liquidity, institutional trust, and a thriving L2 ecosystem, Solana’s momentum as a high-performance L1 is clear. Ethereum is building an increasingly modular stack, while Solana believes in the highly optimized, monolithic structure. The institutional confidence in ETH as an asset is highlighted by the recent introduction of ETFs, and initiatives such as the recently introduced Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS) certification establishes an objective benchmark of excellence for professional Ethereum node operators. But Solana’s achievements, and future potential, cannot be understated. Solana is actively scaling its mainnet infrastructure, creating a superhighway for future growth without fragmenting liquidity across L2s. Furthermore, Solana’s institutional interest has been signaled by a number of major players, including Franklin Templeton. While Ethereum’s advantage as a first mover is evident, both networks will play important roles in shaping the future of finance in both 2024 and beyond.

Title: Binance CEO Richard Teng on Navigating Crypto Regulation and Accelerating Adoption

Time Published: 2024-09-26T15:21:57Z
Full Content:
In a candid interview on CoinDesk TV, Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, opened up about his role at the world’s largest crypto exchange, the company’s relationship with global regulators, and his outlook on the future of cryptocurrency adoption. Over the course of the discussion, Teng shared insights into the challenges and successes Binance has faced, his commitment to innovation, and the broader implications of crypto’s evolution. Since taking on the role of CEO at Binance, Teng has been focused on building a robust and compliant platform for its 220 million users worldwide. Teng noted that Binance has made significant strides in expanding its presence and gaining regulatory approvals across multiple jurisdictions, including Indonesia, India, Kazakhstan, Thailand, and Dubai. Reflecting on the company’s journey, Teng emphasized that Binance’s primary mission is to support the “freedom of money” and foster a vibrant blockchain ecosystem. He acknowledged the challenges Binance faced when he took over, such as regulatory fines, but emphasized that the platform’s strong foundation and user trust, built over seven years, have allowed it to continue thriving. Teng was clear in addressing the regulatory hurdles Binance has faced, particularly the skepticism from global regulators. He highlighted that the regulatory landscape has shifted dramatically in the last few years, with more countries enacting clearer frameworks for cryptocurrency. As a former financial services regulator himself, Teng understands the importance of balancing innovation with risk mitigation. He stressed that regulation should not be one-dimensional and must support both the protection of users and the growth of the crypto sector. In terms of the broader industry, Teng mentioned that crypto has been misunderstood by regulators and the public alike. He urged policymakers to better educate themselves about blockchain technology and the benefits of cryptocurrencies. According to Teng, the perception that crypto is primarily used for illicit activities is outdated, with the actual amount of crypto-related money laundering being minuscule compared to traditional fiat currencies. One of the most significant developments Teng highlighted is the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. He described 2024 as a landmark year for crypto adoption, with increasing regulatory clarity and institutions like BlackRock moving from crypto skepticism to advocacy. Teng believes that institutional involvement is critical to driving mainstream adoption, marking a pivotal shift in how cryptocurrencies are perceived by traditional financial institutions. According to Teng, the rapid growth in Binance’s user base is a testament to the increasing pace of crypto adoption. The platform gained its first 100 million users in five years, the second 100 million in just two years, and Teng expects the next 100 million users to come even faster. Binance remains committed to supporting this accelerated growth by continuously improving its products and services. Security and compliance are two of Binance’s top priorities, according to Teng. He noted that Binance’s compliance spending has increased significantly, with $230 million allocated in 2023, up from $158 million the previous year. Binance has also invested heavily in expanding its compliance team, with over 500 staff dedicated to ensuring regulatory adherence. In terms of security, Teng discussed the importance of protecting users’ assets and highlighted the company’s efforts in recovering funds lost to scams and fraud. Binance has helped users recover $73 million in stolen funds in 2023 alone. The company also maintains a $1 billion insurance fund (the SAFU Fund) to safeguard users’ assets in the event of a security breach. Teng touched on one of the biggest challenges facing the crypto industry: the lack of global regulatory harmony. Different jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies differently—some as commodities, others as securities or payment tokens. This inconsistency makes it difficult for companies like Binance to operate seamlessly across borders. Teng advocated for a global regulatory framework that could streamline compliance and protect users more effectively. However, Teng acknowledged that achieving such a framework would require significant political will and collaboration among regulators. Despite the challenges, he remains optimistic that, as the industry matures, there will be greater convergence toward standardized regulations. When asked about his personal journey into the crypto space, Teng recalled how he first encountered cryptocurrency in 2017, a time when institutional investors were not involved in the space. He admitted that he never imagined himself leading Binance, given his background in traditional finance and regulation, but his belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology ultimately drew him into the industry. Looking forward, Teng is bullish about the future of cryptocurrency. He envisions rapid growth in adoption and continued technological advancements, particularly in areas like asset tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi). His goal is to position Binance at the forefront of these developments while maintaining the company’s commitment to security, compliance, and user protection. As for challenges, Teng acknowledged that crypto is a highly dynamic industry where new obstacles arise daily. However, he remains focused on sustainable growth and ensuring that Binance continues to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape.

CEO Satya Nadella highlighted a plan to invest in Mexico over the next three years to build its AI and Cloud infrastructure. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is doubling down on its cloud computing and artificial intelligence investment. Earlier this week, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlighted the company's plan to invest up to $1.3 billion over the next three years to build its infrastructure in Mexico to foster these advances. The tech giant plans to use its $1.3 billion investment to enhance broad adoption of AI technology across small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Microsoft aspires to reach up to 5 million Mexicans and 30,000 SMBs in three years through the initiative. This happens as OpenAI just unveiled OpenAI Academy — the program is designed to make generative AI more accessible to developers across low and middle-income countries with up to $1 million in API credits. According to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: “We are entering a new era of AI with the promise to create inclusive economic growth and opportunity across every role, industry, and country, including in Mexico. Our investments in AI infrastructure and skilling in Mexico will help ensure people and organizations across the country realize the benefits of this technology shift.” Microsoft marks 38-years in Mexico with companies like Grupo Bimbo, Tec de Monterrey and Cemex onboard its AI train. With its new initiative, the tech giant hopes to address emerging health concerns, connectivity issues and promote sustainability as part of its broader plans to become a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company. It's apparent that it takes an arm and a leg to keep AI operations running. For instance, OpenAI spends up to $700,000 to keep ChatGPT running. Still, the payoff isn't allowing the AI firm to break even. Reports hitting mainstream media indicate that the ChatGPT maker could be on the brink of bankruptcy, with projections of $5 billion in losses over the next year. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. However, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Apple will reportedly participate in the firm's latest round of funding to keep its operations afloat, pushing its market cap well beyond $150 billion. Market analysts and experts are confident that OpenAI will become the world's dominant AI company, further citing that it's in a unique consumer and enterprise position. Incidentally, Microsoft is having the same issues, with some of its investors raising concerns over its high expenditure on AI projects, citing its difficult to establish a clear path toward profitability in the category. Last year, the tech giant partnered with OpenAI and invested $100 billion in a project dubbed Stargate to free themselves from an overdependence on NVIDIA for AI chips. Similarly, the company recently partnered with BlackRock to raise $100 billion to 'emancipate themselves from the shackles' of insufficient power and increase data centers for their ambitious AI dreams.

As investors seek ways to harness Bitcoin’s volatile and often unpredictable nature, BlackRock argues that Bitcoin’s prices may be uncorrelated to stocks and other traditional assets in a new report. The authors call Bitcoin a “unique diversifier” because its behavior is difficult to analyze within traditional economic frameworks. While Bitcoin prices may correlate with established markers like the S&P 500 in the short-term, the report says, they often rally higher than others over time. “We view this pattern as instances of fundamentals eventually prevailing over short-term leveraged trading reactions,” the report said. Iván Rodríguez, an associate professor of finance at Eastern Michigan University, has come to a similar conclusion in his own research. “There are periods where the correlation seems to be really high and these periods where these correlations kind of decouple, like the correlation disappears, or it’s negative,” he said. “So when you look over the long-term it seems like they’re uncorrelated.” Rodríguez points to a concept called intermarket flows to explain why Bitcoin and other traditional assets tend to correlate in the short-term. During times of volatility, an investor might choose to sell S&P 500 and invest in Bitcoin or vice versa. “So it can induce a negative correlation. It can induce a positive correlation,” Rodríguez said. “But those decisions that I’m making, or the market’s making on aggregate, that’s going to drive prices.” As its proponents like to point out,, Bitcoin is decentralized, open-source and detached from fiat-currencies and major geopolitical risks. Because of this, the BlackRock report says, some investors have embraced it as a “flight to safety” over the last five years. This means it is viewed as a safe bet amid times of political and economic instability, similar to gold. “When we think about Bitcoin, we think about primarily as an emerging global monetary alternative,” Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets and one of the report’s authors, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. As concerns over the U.S. national debt rise, Bitcoin becomes an attractive, alternative reserve asset, detached from the value of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock’s report claims that because of this, Bitcoin can be valuable in helping investors diversify their portfolios. “I think people are taking that idea to heart, and they are investing in Bitcoin to safeguard their money,” said Rodríguez, the Michigan professor. But, he cautions investors against overestimating Bitcoin’s diversification power. “I do think, from a diversification point of view, for example, because they are related fundamentally, because investors are investing both in that and in the stock market, it’s not going to have as good of a diversification effect as the authors’ claim,” Rodríguez added. At the moment, cryptocurrencies and other assets are showing high correlation. A recent Bloomberg study reported that the largest one hundred digital assets and the S&P 500 have been fluctuating together at a level only exceeded once before, in 2022. This could, of course, change based on new developments in the world. “Over the long term, bitcoin’s adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the degree to which concerns rise and fall over global monetary instability, geopolitical disharmony, U.S. fiscal sustainability and U.S. political stability,” the report said. The new BlackRock report comes at a time when the world’s biggest asset manager has moved into digital assets in a major way following a shift in the regulatory environment. BlackRock became one of around a dozen firms offering Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year, an unprecedented step for both the company and the stock market. An ETF is usually a collection of stocks, bonds or other assets that can be listed as shares on a major exchange. In the case of Bitcoin, ETFs are a way to package cryptocurrencies and offer them on the stock market, making them accessible to a broader group of people. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is known as iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT. Today, IBIT has $22 billion in assets under management and is trading at $36. The ETF reached its highest volume in mid March, almost hitting $4 billion before settling around $1.5 billion. All of this suggests how Bitcoin is becoming an integral part of BlackRock’s business, and why understanding its complex cycles will be important in coming years. In June, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that Bitcoin is “digitizing gold.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Why Financial Institutions Need to Engage in ESG

As the world becomes increasingly aware of the climate crisis, social inequalities, and corporate governance issues, consumers are demanding more responsibility from businesses, including banks and financial institutions. This shift didn't happen overnight, but the evolution of consumer attitudes towards environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, accelerated by global challenges like COVID-19, is forcing industries to reimagine their impact on the world. Evolving consumer expectations Consumers have always prioritized convenience, service quality, and product offerings when selecting a bank or financial institution. However, a growing awareness of social and environmental issues has transformed this rationale. Consumers today are looking beyond products and interest rates; they are scrutinizing how financial institutions align with their personal values around sustainability, social justice, and ethical governance. The data shows that 40% of US households would sacrifice some return to invest in companies that reflect their values. The rise of social media, instant access to information, and global movements like Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, etc. have amplified this shift. Younger generations, particularly those under 40, are leading the charge, placing pressure on businesses to not only serve their financial needs but also contribute meaningfully to societal challenges. For these consumers, it is no longer enough for a bank to avoid harmful practices – banks must now actively engage in sustainable and responsible initiatives to earn their trust. The data shows that 42% of US households would only do business with financial institutions that they believe are committed to improving social issues. The banking sector's response to ESG Recognizing this shift, many financial institutions in the US have started embracing ESG principles, although the degree of commitment varies. Large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, have begun implementing sustainability goals, with some pledging to achieve net-zero carbon emissions within their lending portfolios by 2050. These moves signal that ESG has become a core consideration, not just a marketing tool. Banks are investing in renewable energy projects, issuing green bonds, and offering products like ESG-focused investment funds to cater to this evolving consumer base. The investment sector's response to ESG Investment firms are also adapting by offering their clients portfolios that prioritize ESG-conscious companies. BlackRock, for example, has publicly committed to making sustainability a core component of its investment strategy. This is not just about meeting regulatory requirements but also about attracting a consumer base that is increasingly selective about where their money is invested. However, while some financial institutions have made strides in embracing ESG principles, others have been slower to act. For many, the process of integrating these considerations into their business model requires a significant cultural and operational shift, which can take time to realize. The impact of COVID-19 on ESG initiatives The COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in the momentum for many businesses looking to invest in and roll out ESG initiatives. With the economy in crisis mode, many companies diverted resources toward more immediate concerns, such as maintaining liquidity, preserving jobs, and meeting short-term financial obligations. This resulted in delays in launching or expanding ESG-related programs. In the banking and finance sectors, the focus shifted to stabilizing operations and responding to customer needs during unprecedented financial uncertainty. Banks had to prioritize lending and support for small businesses and vulnerable communities affected by the pandemic, while ESG initiatives often took a backseat. The pandemic also reinforced the importance of ESG. It exposed systemic vulnerabilities, from economic inequalities to the need for stronger corporate governance, prompting a reevaluation of long-term strategies. As the immediate crisis subsides, businesses are finding that ESG commitments are more important than ever in building resilience for future challenges. Like businesses, consumers’ attentions were also redirected and focused on immediate needs such as healthcare, employment, and financial stability. The emphasis on ESG temporarily decreased, as consumers' attention was drawn toward personal survival rather than the ethical and sustainable practices of corporations. This shift in focus highlights the fragility of ESG priorities during times of crisis but also sets the stage for a renewed and stronger commitment post-pandemic. ESG across industries The banking sector is not the only industry where ESG has become a significant driver of consumer decision-making. Across sectors such as retail, technology, and automotive, ESG has become a vital part of brand identity and product development. For example, electric vehicle manufacturers like Tesla have positioned themselves as leaders in sustainability, making environmental responsibility central to their value proposition. In retail, companies like Patagonia and Nike have embraced sustainability and ethical labor practices, responding to consumers who are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and socially responsible products. The trend is clear: consumers are increasingly expecting companies to align with their values, and this mindset carries over when choosing financial products or providers. How financial institutions can better support ESG and social initiatives For banks and financial institutions, the path forward is clear: engaging deeply with ESG principles is no longer optional. Those that fail to prioritize these areas risk losing relevance, particularly among younger, values-driven consumers. So how can financial institutions better support ESG, local communities, and social initiatives? 1. Product innovation: Develop products and services that support ESG goals, such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and ESG-focused mutual funds. By aligning their offerings with consumer values, banks can attract customers who are committed to social and environmental change. 2. Community investment: Support local communities through targeted investments in small businesses, affordable housing, and renewable energy projects. This not only builds goodwill but also strengthens long-term customer relationships. 3. Transparency and accountability: Consumers demand authenticity. Financial institutions should provide clear and transparent reporting on their ESG commitments, offering measurable goals and progress updates. Establishing trust is key to maintaining consumer loyalty. 4. Employee engagement: Foster a culture of social responsibility within the organization by encouraging employees to participate in ESG-related initiatives, from volunteer programs to corporate sustainability efforts. Employees who feel connected to these values are more likely to be engaged and contribute to the company's long-term success. Why financial institutions need to engage in ESG The financial sector wields significant influence over the broader economy and has the ability to drive meaningful change. By embracing ESG principles, banks and financial institutions not only meet consumer expectations but also contribute to solving some of the most pressing global challenges, from climate change to social inequality. As consumers continue to hold businesses to higher standards, the financial sector must recognize that its role is evolving. ESG is no longer a "nice to have" – it has become imperative to long-term success. Financial institutions that embrace this reality will not only meet the demands of today’s consumers but also help shape a more sustainable, equitable future.
