The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Fusion startups have raised $7.1 billion to date, according to the Fusion Industry Association, with the majority of it going to a handful of companies. With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc’s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. Now in its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The company, based in Richmond, British Columbia, was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. The company is currently building its first demonstration plant, LM26, which it hopes will hit scientific breakeven by 2026. Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. Based in Everett, Washington, Helion has raised $607.64 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Founded in 1998, TAE (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: After the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. TAE has raised $1.32 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Alphabet, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Venrock. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squishes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy has raised $285.65 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. Based in Oxfordshire, U.K., First Light has raised $179.94 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $109.3 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Across three days straight of losses so far in October, investors have cashed out a total of $361.2 million from such products, data from London investment firm Farside Investors shows. The outflows come after a week of solid inflows: Investors last week plugged over $1 billion into the funds. October—dubbed “Uptober” by some traders—is a month generally known for having high crypto prices in the past following what has historically been a chilly September for Bitcoin and other top assets. However, Bitcoin ultimately had a strong September this year after a rough initial start to the month. Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped below $60,000 on Thursday; now it stands at about $62,200, up more than 3% on the day. Bitcoin ETFs—approved for trading in the U.S. in January—led to the rise of the biggest and oldest asset this year. In March, the coin touched a new all-time high of $73,737 as investors previously unwilling to handle crypto assets threw cash at Bitcoin via the new regulated investment vehicles trading on stock exchanges. Wall Street titans such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck all have Bitcoin funds available to investors via brokerage accounts. But the fast-flowing cash has stalled in recent months. The reason? Geopolitical tensions aren’t helping, analysts told Decrypt this week. During times of political instability, investors tend to eye-up “safe haven” assets like gold or treasuries. We’re only in the first week of “Uptober,” though. Will investor sentiment change?

Title: Giant Banks Struggle, But Private Credit Is Soaring

Time Published: 2024-10-04T17:14:45Z

“It’s simple supply and demand” said the President of Monroe Capital. “When banks go through crises, there’s more regulatory oversight and they pull back, which shifts market share from banks to the private credit arena.” This rings especially true in Silicon Valley. I’ve experienced it firsthand through Arc’s capital marketplace, where hundreds of private credit investors like Monroe have been inundated with billions in loan demand since we launched in January. But why? Too Big to Fail banks struggle with reams of regulations and high reserve requirements. Regional banks tread cautiously past the bellyflops of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic. In their wake, loans to high-tech outfits in the valley are now harder to find. Venture capital investment in Silicon Valley peaked in 2021 and took a dive. Private equity has followed a rocky path, with leveraged buyouts posting only an 8% return last year, the lowest in over a decade. In the public debt markets, rising interest rates have made borrowing costs untenable for issuers seeking financing. Prolonged economic uncertainty has stretched timelines for issuers. As a result, the market for publicly traded high-yield debt has shrunk by almost 25% in three years says M Capital Group. With crisis comes opportunity: private credit is soaring. The asset class features loans that lie outside the heavily regulated banking system, never to be traded publicly. This ~$2 trillion market is up 50% in the same three years in which public high-yield debt has fallen. Private debt gained $400 billion in that period, while public debt declined the same amount: a telling shift. That fat sum, in effect, left banking giants like J.P. Morgan Chase and flowed to the likes of Blackstone and Apollo. Supply and demand indeed. Private credit outpacing other asset classes Even more surprising: on top of that 50% growth since 2021, the private debt business is set to grow another 87% in the next five years. According to Ashwin Krishnan, co-head of North America Private Credit at Morgan Stanley, the private debt market will soar to $2.8 trillion by 2028. As he writes here, “private credit has filled a lending void” since the global financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting stiff rules imposed on banks for capital requirements, loan terms, and disclosure. This turned the biggest, richest banks in the world into timid lenders, even as demand for loans surged on a rise in infrastructure projects (public and private) for clean energy, new chip plants, electric cars, and, more recently, vast spending on the AI wave. BlackRock has an even more aggressive forecast. It says the private-credit market will double in size to $3.5 trillion in 2028, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, KKR and State Street, the Journal says, now are competing for the next big prize in private debt: “full access to mom-and-pop investors when many sophisticated institutions are filing up on private credit.” The non-bank giants are “jostling to launch private-credit exchange-traded funds and other retail products,” the WSJ states. Apollo, which manages almost $700 billion in assets, expects to originate more than $200 billion a year in private loans eventually, doubling up on $97 billion in debt deals it did last year, the Financial Times reported. The firm sees “large demand to issue high-rated loans that will be purchased by its insurance arm Athene and other independent insurers,” the paper says. In a similar manner, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman recently announced the integration of its private credit and insurance groups in its effort “to reach $1 trillion in the next ten years.” No wonder Jamie Dimon is taking shots at private credit. In his letter to shareholders last month, he wrote: “Frequently, the weaknesses of new products, in this case private credit loans, may only be seen and exposed in bad markets, which private credit loans have not yet faced.” When you can’t beat ’em, impugn their creditworthiness. Jamie wishes his rivals in private credit had to endure the same burdensome regulations that J.P Morgan does. Yet, the ability to sidestep this tangle is precisely why private credit is thriving—and why corporate borrowers are lining up to get it. Unencumbered by a restrictive regulatory framework, private credit investors can move fast and price in risk in a way that banks simply cannot compete. This must be why Citigroup just announced a $25 billion private credit deal with Apollo to better serve Citi’s capital-starved clients. Last month, KKR extolled the private credit business to investors, describing a “structural shift away from the traditional commercial banking model,” and holding up a truly stunning figure: $40 trillion in future opportunity. Apollo, Blackstone and other private market heavyweights have synthetically replicated the traditional commercial banking model. But instead of highly-regulated bank deposits, they’re tapping deep pools of insurance capital, unlocking speed, flexibility and liquidity for the private markets at a time when equity remains expensive. Can you imagine all that business bypassing the likes of J.P. Morgan? As a fintech guy, I surely can. In fact, the upstarts of fintech already are making inroads into the private credit industry. The money center banks are Too Big to Call if you are running a tech company seeking, say, only $10 million to $100 million in financing. Yet, it can be hard to find lenders. The trick lies in how to match up an assortment of lenders, business borrowers, and investors willing to buy into a deal. And for private credit investors, the challenge is sifting through mountains of unstructured private company data to capitalize on the multi-trillion dollar market opportunity. Artificial intelligence, now advancing almost by the hour, can help a lot in this effort. At my company, Arc, we have been working on this, and the early results are exciting and encouraging.

Full Content:
Terenure host Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s taut semi-final at Lakelands Park in the standout tie of the Energia All-Ireland on Saturday afternoon. The two sides are among the cluster of six Division 1A teams who have won one and lost after two rounds. Each took two bonus points from their respective defeats but even so at least one of these big hitters will likely have ground to make up by teatime on Saturday. In light of Peter Sylvester’s departure, Terenure juggle their midfield again, with Jules Fenelon, a close-season capture from Trinity, making his first start, while Chris Cosgrave reverts to inside centre and Aran Egan to outhalf. Notable inclusions on the bench are Marcus Hanon, fit-again captain Luke Clohessy and the highly regarded Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel. Lansdowne give winger Todd Lawlor, part of Newbridge’s SCT last season, his debut and recall brother Donough at number eight. Harry O’Riordan at centre, outhalf Steve McMahon, flanker Clive Ross and tighthead Tom Connolly are all named. Clontarf, with a maximum 10 points, go to UCD at a time when Emerging Ireland and Leinster call-ups have weakened the students. Young Munster face a searching test of their unbeaten start away to champions Cork Constitution, who bounced back from an opening day loss to Terenure by beating Ballynahinch 51-21 last week. After unluckily returning empty-handed from Clontarf, Garryowen will look to build on their encouraging return to 1A at home to winless City of Armagh and ditto St Mary’s, significantly reinforced over the summer, when they head north to Ballynahinch. The two promoted sides have quickly set about supporting the view that they have raised the bar in 1A this season. The 1B pacesetters, Old Belvedere and Nenagh Ormond, will be in proximity when the former host Blackrock in Ollie Campbell Park while the Tipp club face Old Wesley in Energia Park. The 2A quartet with a maximum 10 points are all on the road, with Barnhall in Ballymena, Greytones in Instonians, Navan in Corinthians and Cashel away to Buccaneers. The early leaders in 2B, Wanderers and Skerries, are away to Malone and Dungannon respectively. In the Women’s Division, last season’s dominant two meet as champions UL Bohemians host Railway Union in a reprise of last April’s final at the Aviva Stadium, which the Limerick club won by 48-38. Men’s Division 1A: Ballynahinch v St Mary’s College, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v Young Munster, Temple Hill; Garryowen v City of Armagh, Dooradoyle; Terenure College v Lansdowne, Lakelands Park; UCD v Clontarf, Belfield. Division 1B: Highfield v Dublin University, Woodliegh Park; Old Belvedere v Blackrock College, Ollie Campbell Park; Old Wesley v Nenagh Ormond, Energia Park; Queen’s v UCC, Dub Lane; Shannon v Naas, Thomond Park. Division 2A: Ballymena v MU Barnhall, Eaton Park; Buccaneers v Cashel, Dubarry Park; Greystones v Instonians, Dr. Hickey Park; Navan v Corinthians, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Banbridge, Takumi Park. Division 2B: Dungannon v Skerries, Stevenson Park; Galwegians v Clogher Valley, Crowley Park; Malahide v Sligo, Estuary Road; Malone v Wanderers, Gibson Park; UL Bohemian v Rainey, UL4G. Division 2C: Bruff v Belfast Harlequins, Kilballyowen Park; Clonmel v Dolphin, Ardgaoithe; Midleton v Ballyclare, Towns Park; Omagh Academicals v Monkstown, Thomas Mellon Playing Fields; Tullamore v Enniscorthy, Spollanstown. Women’s Division (5.0 unless stated): Ballincollig v Suttonians, Tanner Park (3pm); Cooke v Tullow, Shaws Bridge; Old Belvedere v Blackrock College, Ollie Campbell Park; UL Bohemian v Railway Union, UL4G; Wicklow v Galwegians, Ashtown Lane.

By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - A high-stakes corporate earnings season kicks into gear next week, with bullish investors hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in a U.S. stock market near record highs. The case for strong U.S. economic growth got a boost on Friday, after labor market data came in far above expectations. The S&P 500 is up 20% year-to-date and stands near record highs despite recent tumult spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. A key test for the rally will arrive as corporate results begin rolling in next week. Companies need to post healthy profit growth and strong outlooks for next year to sustain valuations that have crept up in recent months: At 21.5 times future 12-month earnings estimates, the S&P 500 is trading near its highest level in three years and is well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. "One of the few rationales that the bulls can make for these lofty (valuation) multiples is that earnings growth keeps coming in at high levels," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "With prices having run up, you really do need that earnings growth to come in probably at much better than expected levels." S&P 500 earnings are expected to have climbed 4.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, UBS equity strategists said in a report on Wednesday. However, earnings likely grew 8.5% when factoring in the historical rate of positive earnings surprises, the UBS strategists said. Such profit beats may be needed to fuel more gains in stocks. Since 2010, the S&P 500's total return has closely tracked the increase in company earnings and dividends, according to Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. But the index has run ahead since early 2023, and is now about 18% above expected levels, based on current earnings and dividends, Ablin found. "The market's a little bit over its skis here," Ablin said. "It's certainly anticipating some pretty strong earnings and dividend growth." Data on U.S. consumer prices due next week will give investors another snapshot of the economy. A stronger than expected number, on the heels of Friday's jobs data, could further curtail expectations for how much the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates in coming months. Futures tied to the fed funds rate on Friday showed pricing of a 50 basis point cut at the Fed's November meeting falling to 5%, from over 30% on Thursday, according to CME FedWatch. BANKS IN SPOTLIGHT Major financial firms highlight next week's earnings reports, with JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) due on Oct 11. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the state of delinquencies and loan demand, said Bryant VanCronkhite, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. More broadly, VanCronkhite will be looking for signs that the Fed's initial 50-basis point cut - delivered at its monetary policy meeting last month - is already having an effect on the economy through such channels as rising auto sales and other big ticket purchases. Ideally, such activity will be sustained even if expectations for further rate cuts fall further following Friday's strong jobs report. Following the first rate cut, companies ideally will show leading demand indicators are strengthening, VanCronkhite said. "That would probably give me confidence that we're heading more towards that soft landing," he said.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Jio Financial and U.S.-based BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) got in-principle approval from India's markets regulator to act as co-sponsors and set up a mutual fund business in the country, the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group company said on Friday. Jio Financial said the Securities and Exchange Board of India will grant the final approval after the two companies fulfil certain requirements, on which it did not elaborate. Days after its demerger from Reliance Industries in July 2023, the company had announced the formation of a 50:50 joint venture with BlackRock to launch asset management services in India. The companies signed a second joint venture in April to set up a wealth management and broking business in the country.

Title: Irish women’s team braced for another tough WXV 1 assignment as Canada await on home soil

Ireland face one of the most difficult challenges in rugby late on Saturday night (Irish time) in trying to follow up beating the World Cup winners New Zealand with another win over hosts Canada on home soil. Currently ranked the number two side in the world rankings, Canada are also seeking their second win in the WXV 1 tournament in Vancouver, having beaten France in their first match. Both unbeaten sides go into the game with wind in their sails and with a weather eye on the World Cup next year in England. That, at least, is how Canada’s head coach Kevin Rouet is thinking. “We made some adjustments to the team after France because it is important that we continue to build depth in our squad,” said Rouet. “The Rugby World Cup will be a long journey and if we want to accomplish our ultimate goal, we will need a squad full of experienced and talented players. It will take more than just a group of 23 players.” Ireland coach Scott Bemand and his side go into the match with forced and unforced changes, and importantly without their captain Edel McMahon, who has been ruled out after sustaining a knock in training earlier in the week. That is a blow to Ireland, not least of all for McMahon’s leadership qualities on the pitch. Blackrock College’s inside centre, Enya Breen deputises and leads Ireland out for the first time. Breen’s Blackrock team-mate Emily Lane is another adjustment to the starting side and makes her Irish debut at scrumhalf beside Dannah O’Brien to complete the halfbacks. Olympic Sevens player Erin King, who came up big from off the bench in the game against New Zealand, is rewarded for her two tries. She starts this week at blindside flanker with Aoife Wafer, who also scored two tries last time out and was named player of the match, switching to openside in the absence of McMahon. The Kiwis did not know Wafer’s name before their game and referred to her as the red scrum cap. After two tries against Australia a few weeks ago and two against them last weekend, they do now. If Ireland can back up their win with even a draw against Canada, they will climb one place to fifth in the world so long as the current fifth-placed Scotland fail to beat Japan in their meeting this afternoon at The Athlone Sports Stadium in Cape Town. Ireland have not played Canada in eight years, but in beating France and scoring seven tries, Bemand is in no doubt about the difficulty of facing the hosts. France defeated Ireland 38-17 in their last meeting in this year’s Six Nations Championship. Like Ireland, two players scored twice for Canada last week including right wing Fancy Bermudez, who won the silver medal with the Canadian Sevens team in Paris last summer, and Laetitia Royer. Asia Hogan-Rochester is another one of the five Sevens players in the team, who also touched down last week. Of the double scorers just Burmudez starts against Ireland with Royer selected among the replacements. After breaking the all-time Canadian women’s cap record in May with her 68th cap, captain Tyson Beukeboom will hit another significant milestone against Ireland with her 70th. “A number of players have earned their opportunity in a green jersey on Saturday having worked hard to compete across the week and it will be a special moment for Enya to lead the team for the first time, supported by our leaders,” said Bemand. “A strong Canada outfit will provide a different challenge for us and we’re looking forward to testing ourselves against one of the best teams in the world.” The likelihood is Canada will defend with much more aggression than New Zealand did last week with several of the Irish tries, including King’s score at the end of the match, coming from passive defending on their line. It is a rare opportunity for Canada to play in front of home support, and this week their intentions could not have been made clearer. Ireland: Stacey Flood (Railway Union); Eimear Considine (UL Bohemian/Munster), Eve Higgins (Railway Union), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Emily Lane (Blackrock College); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Clíodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Erin King (Old Belvedere), Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College/Leinster), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster). Replacements: Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Siobhán McCarthy (Worcester Warriors/Munster), Andrea Stock (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (Old Belvedere/Munster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster), Nicole Fowley (Galwegians/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster).

Title: BlackRock Calls Bitcoin 'Global Monetary Alternative'

U.Today - The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has changed its official perspective on Bitcoin, now referring to it as a global monetary alternative. This is according to Jay Jacobs, the U.S. Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at BlackRock, during a recent digital assets conference. The presentation described the features of Bitcoin in comparison to conventional financial assets like U.S. gold and Treasuries. The presentation's main conclusions indicate that in contrast to the U.S. markets' variable supply, BlackRock views Bitcoin's supply as fixed. S. Treasury bonds and the gold supply are somewhat fixed. But in contrast to the relatively low volatility of U.S. stocks, volatility for Bitcoin is still high. The short track record of Bitcoin, in contrast to the medium and long histories of gold and Treasuries, is another significant distinction. However, Bitcoin differs from U.S. currency in that it is a decentralized asset akin to gold's money reserves. The presentation's second section concentrated on Bitcoin's volatility and relationships with other assets, especially gold and stocks. Since Bitcoin and the stock market have little historical correlation, Bitcoin is a desirable portfolio diversifier. Even though it is highly volatile, its volatility has declined over time, which has added to its increasing market maturity. The last section focused on the potential effects that even modest Bitcoin holdings could have on a conventional portfolio. Proposed were scenarios in which Bitcoin was allocated 1% to 5% of the portfolio. The results indicated that despite higher volatility, portfolios with Bitcoin experienced better returns and risk-adjusted metrics. Better returns are achieved with higher Bitcoin allocations, but risk metrics such as drawdowns are sharper. The wider market may continue to develop, bridging the divide between cryptocurrency and more established financial systems, as institutional players like BlackRock begin to include Bitcoin in their portfolios and see it as a viable alternative to traditional assets.

Title: Hurricane Helene and the ‘Known Unknown’ of Climate Costs

Time Published: 2024-10-04T14:58:41Z

(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.) Hurricane Helene is a significant human tragedy with more than 200 deaths reported as of Oct. 4. Thousands more have been left homeless, with North Carolina hit particularly hard. And the property damage will be difficult for the thousands of homeowners to manage without adequate flood insurance. Estimates of the economic damage vary. Moody’s initially put the price tag as high as $34 billion. Others, which take into account lost economic output, say the toll could top $100 billion. Despite the magnitude of these numbers, it’s easy to let them go in one ear and out of the other. After all, historically a mix of government institutions and insurance companies have absorbed the cost of a few of these disasters every year, paying out to rebuild. But past results are not necessarily indicative of future outcomes. As the number of billion-dollar disasters rises as a result of climate change, the economic toll of extreme weather will be increasingly difficult to absorb. Governments may hesitate to pay yet another disaster relief bill and insurers will likely continue to drop coverage in vulnerable areas. The result is a grim reality: many communities, individuals, and companies are susceptible to climate-driven economic tumult. This is a “known unknown.” We know it’s going to happen; it’s just a matter of when, and, to some degree, where these challenges will hit. When they do hit, investors, businesses, and individuals will want to ensure that they’re not left holding the bag. To understand the known unknowns of climate risk, it’s helpful to look at the numbers. In 2023, climate-related disasters cost the U.S. about 0.4% of GDP, according to a report from reinsurance giant Swiss RE. As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, those costs are only expected to grow. This cost represents a drag on economic growth that affects every corner of the economy, but not every community, company, or firm will be equally hit. Repeated disasters in one area may result in a dramatic spike in insurance prices for the local community or for insurers to pull out altogether. In either case, residents may choose to leave an area, driving down asset prices and depressing the local economy. Local firms will be affected directly and indirectly. A 2023 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research looks at the effect of climate events on counties across the country. Severe storms, the study found, lead to a capital depreciation shock that drives down the value of local assets. Meanwhile, heat waves lead to a negative productivity shock that contributes to lower output. Both contribute to localized economic stagnation in the long-term. Some of this may already be reflected in the price of assets, but much of it likely isn’t. After all, it’s hard to know when, where, and how extreme weather events will play out—even if we have a general understanding of the contours of a climate-driven downturn. This is a reality that insurance companies and asset managers have been grappling with for years now. “The degree of capital reallocation and the speed of that is going to be larger and happen more quickly than most market participants expect,” Brian Deese told me in 2020 when he was the head of sustainable investing at BlackRock. At a national level, the most important solution to climate risk is to cut the emissions that are causing the problem. But with significant warming—and resulting climate disasters—already baked in, governments also need to double down on adaptation. Swiss RE says that one dollar invested in adaptation can save $11 in avoided climate disaster down the road. With those figures in mind, it would be foolish to wait for the government to get to work on adaptation. Companies can look at ways to harden their physical infrastructure where it works—and, in some cases, to move to safer locations. Investors, too, can help nudge portfolio companies and assets to adapt. And anyone located in a risky area should have appropriate insurance—at least for as long as they can get it.

Title: Through the Lost City of Tol’vir and onto Coren Direbrew

Time Published: 2024-10-04T14:15:49Z

We had one normal mode dungeon left to do when we logged on last weekend. The Lost City of Tol’vir was all that was left to be checked off the list. Ready for the last normal mode dungeon For that final normal mode mission we had the same group as the last time around. The group this week Ula was still a ways from level 85, so we couldn’t queue for Coren Direbrew as an opener, so it was off to Uldum for the dungeon. A few of us went there directly as Ula wanted to get a tabard from the expansion to earn a bit more faction, so she took the Stormwind portal to get the Ramkahen tabard, it being handy and on the way. I assume they have something nice at revered, but at exalted you can get a riding camel. The Lost City is clearly visible on the map and just south of the Ramkahen settlement that forms the nexus of the zone, so she and Potshot flew down to the summoning stone to grab Liftkit and myself. We’ll figure out how to summon some day… We went on in, got ourselves setup, and started into the instance. Relative to the previous week’s run at the Halls of Origination, the lost city was simplicity itself, the whole thing on just one map with all bosses clearly marked. The Lost City of Tol’vir Sure, there is a bit of a winding path and some points where you can go left or right and Lockmaw, the second boss, who is off on his own dead end path… but it is all right there to see. There were even a couple of quests to do… which was not always the case in Cata dungeons. You had to, as an example, do pretty much all of Vashj’ir in order to get the dungeon quests for Throne of Tides, and I still have a Stonecore quests that I finished but can’t find the NPC to turn it in to. The whole things starts off with clearing some mobs, including a mass of tigers, in order to get to General Husam. Guide to the Lost City of Tol’Vir We cleared everything, if only for rep and some xp for Ula, even though it felt like we could skip some of it. And so we landed at the General. Hi General! I looked through the guide briefly and concluded that we could just “get him” and so we did. And we won, ignoring whatever special mechanics he had going for him. General mayhem For the first boss in an instance, that seems normal enough, though I was also interested to see if our recent burst of trying to gear up via Wintergrasp was going to trivialize normal mode for us. I mean, we struggled a bit back at Grim Batol, and had to go back for a second run to get the last boss. But here we were headed on across a bridge and down an open area clearing trash before realizing we were headed for the third boss. So we backtracked a bit because the second boss, Lockmaw, is off on a side path across another bridge. Eyeing Lockmaw and his herald Augh You start with Augh, who looks like he might be a mini boss, but then he disappears mid fight and you just move on to Lockmaw, during which Augh pops in to call in some adds. This put me into my favorite moment of pally tanking, which is “AOE all the things!” I move my attention to that section of my hotbar and unleash. In fact, it is hard to restrain me from that and I have broken more than my allowance of crowd control situations by trying to hit everything. I should tank for randoms on Dungeon Finder. All you need to do is keep running and hitting your AOE skills, right? I mean, that is my observation. Anyway, this time it worked and Lockmaw was done. I like the alignment of his jaw on death That done, we explored the building at the end of the path, just to be sure… and it was all just there for show. So we went back the way we came and looped around to High Prophet Barim, who happens to be about in the location where you start off in Uldum, having to escape from the Lost City. I appreciate a call back like that. The guide had all sorts of things to say about the fight with the High Prophet, including stuff to stay out of, things to run away from, and an add you will need to battle mid-fight. I was trying to digest that, but the voice in the back of my head, still high on the Lockmaw fight, was all, “Shoot them. Shoot them both.” So we just did it… and won. The High Prophet at a loss So yeah, maybe we had geared up a bit. And then it began to rain. Way to confuse people from California. But the sudden change in the weather was all part of the theme of the final boss, Siamat, Lord of the South Wind. And the weather also created some twisters we could jump on to ascend to his platform. We sent Liftkit in first, he having the most experience with this mechanic Up there we beheld the final boss on his raid slick domain. There he is… also, time for health stones This fight was lively, involved adds and a shocking number of special abilities. Literally shocking that is… some chain lightning going on there In the end however, we were able to outmatch him and he was defeated. Roll the achievement. These should be bumper stickers… Time for a victory shot… pity about the rain. We have been to the lost city Once done we were able to take the twister down the other side and head to the front of the instance to turn in the quests. Time to turn in With the quest turn in, Ula hit level 85… and you know what that meant. Time to go see Coren Direbrew… once I queued us up for the right instance. I accidentally queued us for a random dungeon, then quit that and got it right. Queued up for the Brewfest battle That put us once again in the Grim Guzzler in Blackrock Depths where this time Coren was waiting for us. Coren ranting about Brewfest There isn’t much to it… I went to speak to Coren, delivered the insult, refused to apologize, and it was on. It was also another “AOE All the Things!” fight, so I was happy to let loose. Battling Coren That went quickly and soon we had defeated him. Then there was some discussion about how, in past years, each one of us could insult him so we were allowed to battle him five times to get five shots at the best drops… those being the Brewfest mounts in my opinion. That didn’t seem to be an option… but then I queued us up again for him and we reloaded and there he was again. Core still on about Brewfest So we battled him again, and then once more for good measure. Some lolo put me in a barrel No mounts this time, but we can queue up again. Ula opened up a portal to get us to Brewfest to turn things in… and then another portal to get us to where Brefest is actually located. TIL: Mages can have multiple portals running Of course, now that we’re done with normal mode dungeons, we have only heroic options before us. Personally, I am not too keen to re-run things we did on normal, but there are a few heroic only instances like Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep that we do want to peek into. Of course, I checked on that before the group parted for the evening… and we have a bit of gear work to do. Ula is so close So we’ll get to that before we… you know… just jump into heroic. TIL: Mages can have multiple portals running Uh… ::blink:: I used to do that all the time back in Vanilla Classic. I didn’t realize people thought that wasn’t a thing. LikeLike I didn’t think about it at all until I saw Ula put up two. Not a mage player here. LikeLike “AOE All the Things!”: a strategy I can get behind ;) LikeLike Indeed one of the most devious things you can do as a mage is open two portals without moving in between. It looks like you’re going to place A, but IIRC, it would send people randomly to either A or B. Hilarity would ensue, naturally. LikeLike If I’m remembering it correctly, you can still zone in to a heroic if you walk in the front. It’s only group finder that gatekeeps you by ilevel. I could be wrong, though, as there’s so many changes to this stuff over the years. I just remember doing it that way early on in expansions when we were undergeared, but were trying to get everyone ready for raiding. It was painful at times, but we managed to make it through eventually. LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Register Net Outflows for Third Straight Day

Election 2024 coverage presented by The U.S.-listed bitcoin (BTC) and ether {ETH}} spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are doing their part in contributing to the downward price pressures of crypto this week, with bitcoin down 6% and ether down 10%. Investors drained $54.2 million from bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 3, the third consecutive day of net outflows, taking the three-day tally to $361.2 million, according to Farside Investors. The main contributions on Thursday were Ark's ARKB, at $58.0 million, and Fidelity's FBTC, at $37.2 million. BlackRock's IBIT saw an inflow of $36.0 million. Grayscale's GBTC remains relatively muted, with just $5.9 million in outflows this week. That said, the 11 ETFs have amassed a total of $18.5 billion in investor money since inception. Besides, investors are up on average on their investment around 3-10% with an average deposit cost basis between $54,911 and $59,120, according to Glassnode data. The methodology used by Glassnode uses price stamping of bitcoin deposits to ETFs for the top three ETF issuers, which provides a rough break-even point for ETF investors. The data suggests, investors in Fidelity's FBTC has a cost basis of $54,911, Grayscale at $55,943, and BlackRock $59,120. In 2024, these cost basis have provided excellent price support for bitcoin, testing the lower bound multiple times during bull market corrections. At the same time, ether ETFs experienced a net outflow of $3.2 million Thursday. Outflows came from Grayscale's ETHE of $14.7 million, which has now seen a total of $2.9 billion in withdrawals. BlackRock ETHA saw a $12.1 million inflow. Ether ETFs now have a total outflow of $555.4 million, according to Farside Investors data. Still, the performance of BTC and ETH ETFs is impressive compared to industry standards, according to Nate Geraci, President of the ETF store. "Out of 525 ETFs launched in 2024, 13 of the top 25 are either bitcoin or ether related," Geraci said. As of press time, bitcoin was trading at $61,608, while ether was changing hands at $2,391, according to CoinDesk data. Edited by Omkar Godbole.

Title: Take Five: Rate cuts and politics, say no more

(Reuters) - It's a packed week ahead with U.S. inflation data, the start of Q3 earnings, a French budget and possibly a big rate cut from New Zealand. Investors are also on edge as Middle East tensions escalate, while Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is in the spotlight. Here's all you need to know about the week ahead in global markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo. 1/ ONE YEAR OF WAR One year on from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the region looks on the brink of a sprawling war that could potentially reshape the oil-rich Middle East. The conflict, which has killed more than 42,000 people, the vast majority in Gaza, is spreading. Israeli troops are now in neighbouring Lebanon, home to Iran-backed Hezbollah; Iran launched a large scale missile attack on Israel earlier this week. Global markets have remained broadly unfazed. Oil prices, the main conduit for tremors further afield, have jumped about 8% this week, but soft demand and ample supply globally have kept a lid on gains. A further escalation between Iran and Israel could change that, especially if Israel strikes Iran's oil facilities, an option that U.S. President Joe Biden said was under discussion. The scars of the conflict are visible on Israel's economy, which has suffered a number of sovereign downgrades and seen its default insurance spike and bonds slide. 2/ BUSY TIMES U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, posing a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at elevated valuations. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report on Friday. Other results earlier in the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased Q3 earnings by 5.3% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. Thursday's September U.S. consumer price index, meanwhile, will be closely watched for signs that inflation is moderating. Investors are already anticipating hefty rate cuts, after the Federal Reserve kicked off its easing cycle last month. Elsewhere, investors will seek to gauge the economic fallout from a dockworker strike as U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports reopened on Thursday. 3/ A RECKONING France's new government presents its long-awaited budget to parliament on Thursday. It's planning a 60-billion-euro belt-tightening drive, around 2% of GDP, next year. It reckons spending cuts and tax hikes should bring the deficit, seen rising to 6.1% this year in the latest upward revision, to 5% by end-2025. The target date for reaching the euro zone's 3% deficit limit is also being pushed back to 2029 from 2027. That's bad news just ahead of rating reviews kicking off with Fitch next Friday. Markets are not impressed. Having eased slightly, the extra premium France pays for its 10-year debt over Germany's widened back to just under 80 bps, near its highest since August. Ultimately, what may matter more is whether Prime Minister Michel Barnier can pass the budget, given a divided parliament that has investors questioning how long his government will last. 4/ FEELING SHEEPISH A reluctant joiner to global easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is catching up fast. It meets on Oct. 9 and traders reckon the central bank could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The RBNZ cut rates by 25 bps to 5.25% in August, a year ahead of its own projections. Markets price in a drop below 3% by end-2025. This will still be above where traders think U.S. and euro area rates will be. Shorter-term investors are neutral towards the kiwi, but hedge funds have lapped it up this year. Positioning and potentially higher rates than others might insulate New Zealand's currency. So could the return of so-called carry trades and in this case, essentially a bearish bet on the yen in favour of bullish ones on high-yielders such as the kiwi. 5/ POLL POSITIONING When Shigeru Ishiba surprised markets by winning the contest to become Japan's prime minister, investors rushed to re-position themselves for higher interest rates. A week on and the landscape looks different, as Ishiba back-flipped not just on monetary policy, but on prior market-unfriendly support for higher corporate and capital gains taxes. It's perhaps not surprising for a hawk to hide his talons with a snap election looming on Oct. 27. Even so, Ishiba was unabashedly blunt, saying after a meeting with the Bank of Japan - whose independence Ishiba has pledged to honour - that the economy is not ready for further rate hikes. The yen, which had been surging, slid past 147 to a six-week trough by Thursday. Japanese stocks rebounded from their steepest slide since early August. Check back in a month from now for any further policy flip-flops. (Graphics by Kripa Jayaram, Pasit Kongkunakornkul, Vineet Sachdev; Compiled by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Sonali Paul)

Title: BlackRock and Fidelity lead the ETF market despite multiple challenges

While Fidelity and BlackRock dominate the performance charts, which ETFs are lagging behind? As the cryptocurrency market grapples with a broader downturn, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are not immune to the prevailing trends. Recent reports from Farside Investors reveal that BTC ETFs experienced significant outflows, amounting to $52.9 million on 2nd October. However, amidst this challenging landscape, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, has identified two standout Bitcoin ETFs—BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC—as top performers of the 2020s. Both funds have achieved “stud level” status, boasting over $10 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM), highlighting their resilience and appeal to investors even in turbulent times. In his X (formerly Twitter) post, Balchunas noted, Source: Eric Balchunas/X Echoing Balchunas’ sentiment, an X user added, Source: Charles/X This trend was further confirmed by data from Farside Investors, revealing that since its launch, BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed a staggering $21.5 billion in total inflows, while Fidelity’s FBTC has attracted $9.9 billion. These two ETFs have set the pace, leaving other funds trailing. However, October, traditionally viewed as an “Uptober” month following a declining September, has brought mixed results. On the 1st of October, IBIT experienced an inflow of $40.8 million, contrasting sharply with FBTC, which faced outflows of $144.7 million. IBIT recorded outflows of $13.7 million on the 2nd of October, while FBTC rebounded with inflows of $21.1 million, illustrating the volatility and shifting dynamics within the ETF landscape. Conversely, the performance of Ethereum [ETH] ETFs has also been underwhelming. On the 1st of October, cumulative outflows for ETH ETFs reached $48.6 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA experiencing no inflows or outflows, while Fidelity’s FETH saw outflows of $25 million. ETHA continued to struggle, posting outflows of $18 million on the following day. Whereas FETH maintained a steady position with no flows recorded. This trend highlights the challenges facing Ethereum ETFs in the current market environment. Amidst there was another X user who asked a very concerning question, “Would this not then make #GBTC one of the worst performing ETFs of this decade?” This observation is further substantiated by the latest update from Farside Investors, revealing that Grayscale’s GBTC has experienced a staggering total outflow of $20.1 billion since its launch. Similarly, Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF, ETHE, had faced significant outflows totaling $2.93 billion, which surpassed the combined outflows of all other ETH ETFs. On the price front, both cryptocurrencies were experiencing a downward trend, with Bitcoin trading at $60,480.03, reflecting a decline of 0.98% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum was trading at $2,347.81, showing a more substantial dip of 4.35% over the same period.

Title: ‘Bitcoin is the exit door’ – Jack Mallers warns of USD fall

The Fed easing cycle will devalue USD but not BTC or gold, cautions Jack Mallers. Jack Mallers, CEO and founder of Bitcoin [BTC]-focused payment platform Strike, has urged investors with U.S. dollar savings to be cautious as the Fed easing cycle begins. According to the executive, the Fed liquidity injection, or money printing, will dilute USD-based savings, rendering them less valuable. He said those saving in USD would be better off in BTC. “The Fed has begun cutting rates. What does that mean? Financial authorities have decided who is paying for their mistakes: those holding US dollars. Get out of dollars. #Bitcoin is the exit door for everyone.” He added that the Fed’s money printing will eventually boost assets like BTC, but not USD savings. “Printing money, isn’t printing growth. In reality, it destroys those holding the currency. So, if you’re living off the USD value, your life will worsen over the next few years. It will only benefit those that can afford assets like Bitcoin.” Mallers noted that anyone should own BTC, even a fraction, since gold and BTC values will explode during the Fed easing cycle. The Strike executive is one of the major BTC bulls that have championed alternative savings to cushion from USD devaluation amid rising inflation. Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz is another champion in the space and has sounded the alarm about unsustainable US debt and its impact on inflation. Early in the year, Novogratz stated that if the U.S. doesn’t put its fiscal house in order, BTC and digital growth will continue. BlackRock recently echoed the same sentiment in a September report. The firm praised BTC as a ‘unique diversifier.’ Part of the asset manager’s report read, “Over the long term, bitcoin’s adoption trajectory is likely to be driven by the intensity of concerns over global monetary stability, geopolitical stability, U.S. fiscal sustainability, and U.S. political stability.” That being said, BTC has been behaving like a ‘risk-on’ asset, with high negative sensitivity to geopolitical tensions, unlike gold. According to Presto Research, BTC was a blend of risk-on and risk-off properties, with ‘risk-on’ dominating in the near term. The asset was valued at $60.5K at press time, down 6% in the past seven days of trading.

A huge influx of immigrants into our country, without the ability to quickly build housing resulted in horrid living conditions for those immigrants and poor Americans. But the reality is, we can’t solve all the world’s problems. And bringing people from the 3rd world, who don’t respect our freedoms, social norms, and laws, in addition to the heightened demand for housing, AND low availability, will cause extreme havoc on our culture and way of life. These people need to stay in their own country and improve their own country if they want to live in better conditions. Making our lives worse doesn’t fix any of these issues. 15 posted on 10/03/2024 6:52:57 PM PDT by GeorgianaCavendish (Beam me up Scotty. There's no sign of intelligent life down here.)

Land deals and permit approvals will be made behind closed doors and America will be told that there’s nothing they can do about it. At the same time, they drive down wages for the lowest earning jobs. I think the corporate ownership and attempts at destroying neighborhoods are certainly problematic, BUT, it is just like how things were in the turn-of-the-century. A huge influx of immigrants into our country, without the ability to quickly build housing resulted in horrid living conditions for those immigrants and poor Americans. But the reality is, we can’t solve all the world’s problems. And bringing people from the 3rd world, who don’t respect our freedoms, social norms, and laws, in addition to the heightened demand for housing, AND low availability, will cause extreme havoc on our culture and way of life. These people need to stay in their own country and improve their own country if they want to live in better conditions. Making our lives worse doesn’t fix any of these issues. Those who work do . . . and certain businesses love it because the public is subsidizing their artificially low wages with Section 8 housing, EBT benefits and the like. **I know a number of single persons. NONE would support your idea.** If the SHTF in any way they might have to.

Home » Artificial intelligence » OpenAI Gets $6.6 Billion in Funding and Other Big AI News Big news this week in AI, AI startups, AI research and AI funding. This is the first sections. See the rest at Nextbigfuture substack. 1. AI Data center plans and nuclear power. 2. OpenAI DevDay. 3. AI Research 4. Blackrock and Microsoft have a new $30 Billion AI Infrastructure fund 5. Aptos partners with Ignition AI Accelerator (backed by NVIDIA and others) 6. Major recent AI funding announcements including OpenAI 1. AI Data center plans and nuclear power. OpenAI’s Infrastructure Needs: OpenAI has discussed with the US government administration the need for massive AI data centers. Plans hinting at data centers each with a capacity of up to 5 GW (gigawatts), would scale AI data centers that are several times the current capacity of large cities. OpenAI wants to bjuild 5-7 of the super large AI data centers. Oracle’s Zettascale Plans Oracle announced at an event (#OCW24) the creation of the first zettascale OCI Supercluster, powered by NVIDIA’s Blackwell platform. This supercluster aims to allow customers to train and deploy next-generation AI models at an unprecedented scale. It could be years away. AI and Nuclear Power: There’s a trend towards integrating AI data centers with nuclear power. META’s AI chief mentioned building data centers next to nuclear power plants, suggesting a move to secure stable and high-capacity energy sources for AI operations. This comes alongside Microsoft’s power purchase agreement for nuclear energy, signaling a broader industry move towards nuclear power for sustainability and capacity reasons. 2. At OpenAI DevDay. Realtime API: This new feature allows for nearly real-time, speech-to-speech interactions, providing developers with the tools to create seamless voice-based applications. This API supports low-latency multimodal experiences, making voice interactions more natural and accessible. OpenAI announces Vision fine-tuning This allows developers to use images to fine tune models and improve results. OpenAI announces Prompt caching This makes developing your apps a lot cheaper, automatically giving a 50% discount for every input the model has already received. Model Distillation: This process allows developers to create smaller, more cost-effective models by distilling the knowledge from larger, more complex models like GPT-4o into smaller versions like GPT-4o mini. This makes deploying AI in resource-constrained environments more feasible without significantly compromising on capabilities. Cost Reductions: There’s been a significant focus on making AI development more affordable. For instance, OpenAI announced a dramatic reduction in costs for using their APIs, which includes free training tokens for a limited time to encourage developers to experiment with the new features. Audio Input/Output in Chat Completions API: For developers not needing the real-time benefits of the Realtime API, OpenAI also enhanced the Chat Completions API with audio capabilities, allowing for voice interactions at a potentially lower cost.

Title: BlackRock sees Bitcoin volatility continuing to fall

Share this article At the Digital Assets Conference held today, BlackRock unveiled its latest insights on Bitcoin’s volatility and future performance, stating that Bitcoin’s volatility has significantly decreased and will continue to do so over time. BREAKING: BITCOINS VOLATILITY HAS DECLINED AND WILL CONTINUE TO FALL – BLACKROCK pic.twitter.com/iCWafcyLyD — marty (@thinkingvols) October 3, 2024 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, emphasized Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial ecosystem. According to BlackRock, Bitcoin’s volatility has been declining steadily, a trend that the firm expects to continue as adoption grows and the asset matures. BlackRock’s data showed that adding Bitcoin to portfolios improved risk-adjusted returns across multiple time horizons. Portfolios with a 1%, 3%, or 5% Bitcoin allocation saw higher returns over one, two, five, and ten-year periods compared to traditional portfolios. While Bitcoin slightly increased volatility in these hypothetical portfolios, the potential for higher returns often outweighed the added risk. For example, portfolios with a 5% Bitcoin allocation achieved a 19.1% return over the long term, significantly outperforming the 11% return from traditional portfolios without Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock’s analysis also emphasized the importance of long-term holding when it comes to Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the firm, Bitcoin’s lowest four-year trailing return is still an impressive 137%, and holding the asset for three or more years has consistently delivered positive returns. Additionally, BlackRock compared Bitcoin to gold and US Treasuries, emphasizing its fixed supply, decentralized governance, and low correlation with traditional assets, positioning it as a hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies. Moreover, BlackRock noted that while Bitcoin’s volatility remains elevated, it has declined as the asset matured. The analysis showed Bitcoin’s low correlation with gold (0.1) and the S&P 500 (0.2), highlighting its role as an independent asset class. Lastly, BlackRock emphasized Bitcoin as a hedge against the declining value of fiat currencies, especially the US dollar. Highlighting the dollar’s drop since 1913, they positioned Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation. By offering Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock signals its trust in Bitcoin’s long-term value and growing role in financial markets. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: CFTC votes on allowing DLT-based collateral in commodities and derivatives trading
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/cftc-votes-on-allowing-dlt-based-collateral-in-commodities-and-derivatives-trading/
Time Published: 2024-10-03T19:53:59Z
Full Content:
In a significant development for the digital assets market, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is reportedly considering a proposal that would enable the use of digital ledger technology (DLT)-based collateral in commodities and derivatives trading. According to Bloomberg, a subcommittee of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee recently voted to recommend this proposal, which, if approved, could streamline transactions and promote broader adoption of digital assets in traditional finance. If the proposal receives final approval from the main committee, it could lead to a paradigm shift in how trading collateral is managed. The adoption of DLT-based collateral would allow traders to settle transactions using digital assets with the same speed and efficiency that digital ledger and blockchain technology offers. This change would enable brokers to accept tokenized assets, such as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) token, through market-embedded systems. While the use of blockchain-based assets as collateral is already gaining traction among major financial institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan, the CFTC’s potential approval would catalyze broader adoption across the industry. As it stands, only large firms have been able to utilize these innovative financial instruments, but this move could open the doors for smaller market participants to access similar benefits. Despite the positive momentum surrounding the proposal, several steps remain before it can be formally submitted for CFTC approval. The main committee must first review and endorse the subcommittee’s recommendation, and there are no guarantees that the CFTC will approve the proposal in its current form. Regulatory concerns may arise regarding which institutions and blockchains are permitted to participate, which could introduce potential restrictions that may limit the scope of the initiative. Furthermore, the broader context of digital assets in traditional finance cannot be ignored. Recent trends, such as strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicate a growing acceptance and interest in digital assets among institutional investors. For instance, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has recently outperformed its peers, witnessing the highest daily inflow of any fund on September 25, marking a five-day streak of inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. This surge in interest may influence the CFTC’s decision-making process as they consider the implications of allowing digital assets as collateral. As this unfolds, stakeholders will be watching closely as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, potentially paving the way for a more integrated future for digital assets in commodities and derivatives trading.

The move by Saba Capital Management could be interpreted as a signal of confidence in the future performance of BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust. The details of the transaction were signed off by Saba Capital Management representative Zachary Gindes and Boaz Weinstein, indicating the legitimacy and formal acknowledgment of the trade. As market participants analyze the implications of this purchase, it's worth noting that the actions of large shareholders can have a significant impact on investor sentiment and the market performance of the stocks they trade. Adding to the recent purchase by Saba Capital Management, BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (NYSE:BMEZ) presents an interesting profile for investors. According to InvestingPro data, BMEZ boasts a substantial dividend yield of 13.36%, with the last ex-dividend date on September 16, 2024.

Title: Investing giants want to offer retail traders access to a booming sector of financial markets
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/etf/private-credit-etf-state-street-apollo-sec-investor-investing-funds-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-03T17:04:35Z

A booming corner of the financial markets that has only been available to institutions might soon be open to everyday investors. According to The Wall Street Journal, some of the biggest private equity and investment management giants want to offer retail investors access to exchange-traded funds backed by private credit. The term broadly refers to loans made to companies and consumers by nonbank lenders. Historically, fund managers have sold "alternative assets" like private debt to institutional investors at a high cost, generating returns of around 10% in recent years — more than they would have seen from investing in the stock or bond markets. Now, as those institutions slow allocations to private credit, the biggest players in the space want to target a new class of investors. According to the Journal, firms like State Street, Apollo Global Management, and BlackRock are working to roll out private credit ETFs to regular investors. The challenge, though, is building a highly liquid ETF out of illiquid private loans. That hurdle is also what will likely draw the eye of regulators as they ensure the ETFs are appropriate for retail investors. But if these ETFs get approved, they will enable regular investors to tap into a booming market, one that BlackRock expects will more than double to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The race to launch private credit ETFs has heated up in recent months. In May, Capital Group and KKR teamed up to start offering funds investing in both public and private assets—including in private credit—starting next year. Last month, State Street proposed a private debt ETF to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ETF would blend public debt with private debt on mortgage, corporate, and consumer loans purchased from Apollo Global Management. Anna Paglia, State Street's chief business officer, said in a statement the ETF would "democratize access to private asset exposures," and make them "more accessible to a wider swathe of investors." "It is our goal to bring these investments to scale and help facilitate the process of making private assets more accessible and liquid over time. We see this as only the beginning of a new wave of innovation as public and private markets increasingly converge," Paglia said. Alternative assets make up a small share—less than 3%—of individual investors' global investments, KKR's head of Global Client Solutions Eric Mogelof, told the Wall Street Journal. But he says there is huge potential for that share to grow by over three times. "We anticipate these allocations to rise to 10% or greater in the future," he told the Journal.

In a recent transaction, Saba Capital Management, L.P., a significant shareholder in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ), has expanded its holdings in the company. The investment firm purchased an additional 25,228 shares of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust at a price of $7.54 per share, amounting to a total investment of over $190,000. The purchase, which took place on October 1, 2024, increases Saba Capital Management's stake in the trust to a total of 55,819,832 shares. This move demonstrates the firm's continued confidence in the performance and growth potential of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust, which focuses on long-term capital appreciation. The transaction was disclosed in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Saba Capital Management's significant share acquisition reflects its strategic investment decisions and the value it sees in the trust's future. Investors often monitor such purchases by major shareholders as they can indicate a positive outlook on the company's prospects. With the additional shares, Saba Capital Management further solidifies its position as a major investor in BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust. Saba Capital Management's recent acquisition of BlackRock Innovation & Growth Term Trust (NYSE:BIGZ) shares aligns with some intriguing financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. One of the most striking features of BIGZ is its substantial dividend yield, which currently stands at an impressive 13.61%. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting that the trust "pays a significant dividend to shareholders." For income-focused investors, this high yield could be a compelling reason to consider BIGZ, especially given Saba Capital's increased stake. The trust's current P/E ratio of 7.87 suggests it may be undervalued compared to its peers, potentially explaining Saba Capital's interest in increasing its position. This relatively low P/E ratio could indicate an opportunity for value investors. However, it's worth noting that InvestingPro Tips also point out some challenges. The trust "suffers from weak gross profit margins" and its "valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield." These factors might explain why the trust trades at a seemingly attractive valuation despite its high dividend yield. BIGZ has shown positive price performance across various timeframes, with a notable 24.18% total return over the past year. This performance, coupled with the trust trading at 91.64% of its 52-week high, suggests that the market has been warming up to BIGZ's potential. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and metrics beyond those mentioned here. The platform provides a total of 8 tips for BIGZ, offering a deeper dive into the trust's financial health and market position.

Title: Texas’ Abbott Touts Dallas Finance Hub as New Bourse Makes Hires

Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the upstart Texas Stock Exchange will help transform Dallas into the country’s top financial center and boost businesses’ access to capital. “Dallas, Texas, is already a massive financial center, but when you put a stock exchange in there, that will make it really the financial heartbeat of the entire country,” Abbott said Tuesday in an interview. “It’s going to completely transform Dallas.” Abbott, a Republican, said he’s working to change perceptions of the US financial landscape outside of New York, noting that Texas now has more people employed in financial services than the Empire State. He said the robust expansion of data centers over the past few years in Texas will help facilitate rapid transaction speeds once the exchange is operational. Abbott spoke a day after meeting with officials from the new bourse, who announced hires from Charles Schwab Corp., Nasdaq Inc. and the New York Stock Exchange to build up its leadership team ahead of plans to begin operations next year. With the backing of BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities and other investors, the Texas Stock Exchange has raised $135 million and plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few months, Chief Executive Officer James Lee said Monday. The Texas governor said he had spoken with Elon Musk about the possibility of listing his closely held companies on the exchange, and received a positive reception. “I think it is the kind of thing that is really up his alley,” Abbott said. “This really dovetails with the way Elon Musk does business.” Musk, whose closely held companies include SpaceX, Neuralink and X, didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment. Companies that list on the exchange won’t need to meet any environmental, social and governance thresholds, in line with a pledge to slash burdensome regulations for businesses, Lee said Monday. Abbott and the Texas Republican Party have been at the forefront of efforts by lawmakers to crack down on so-called ESG investment practices that take into consideration non-financial factors such as environmental risks.

Essential components of our human intelligence, our human forms of expression, are in the process of being discarded and even suppressed. We seem to be happy, even eager, to allow our freedom, our very capacity to think, to be taken from us.’ The lecture will take place on Wednesday 23rd of October in the United Arts Club, 3 Fitzwiliam Street Upper, Dublin 2. Tickets are available here. Irish writers Kevin Power and Sarah Webb are among the judges announced this week by Caffè Nero as judges for the 2024 Nero Book Awards. Last year’s inaugural awards had a distinctly Irish feel. The inaugural winner of the Nero Book Awards Gold Prize was The Bee Sting by Paul Murray. Murray described winning the Nero Gold Prize as “a tremendous honour”. Winning the prize propelled The Bee Sting to a wider audience, with the paperback jumping from #3,724 to #129 in the Amazon book charts the morning after the announcement. Simon Prosser, Hamish Hamilton publishing director, said: “Winning the Fiction Category and Gold Prize was a great extra boost for The Bee Sting as we prepared to launch our paperback edition, and we were delighted when the book went straight into the Top 5 of the Sunday Times paperback fiction bestseller chart.” Belfast author Michael Magee won the debut fiction prize for Close to Home. The Nero Book Awards 2024 judging panels highlight the importance of author participation in the Awards process.

Title: Charging ahead: Key reasons for confidence in a commercial EV trucking future
URL: https://business.edf.org/insights/charging-ahead-key-reasons-for-confidence-in-a-commercial-ev-trucking-future/

Published: October 3, 2024 by Maaz Haider As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the impacts of climate change have become a tangible concern for millions of people. Among the largest contributors to this crisis is transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have an outsized impact. Hence, reducing transportation emissions is essential. Transitioning to zero-emission trucks will slash climate and air pollution everywhere, improve local economies by creating new jobs, strengthen national security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, and save fleets money on fuel – all of which are especially critical now. While certain trucking entities have concerns about the viability of commercial electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., this presents an opportunity for innovative partnerships. By working together to address these challenges, we can accelerate the transition to zero-emission trucks and reinforce the transportation sector’s commitment to a sustainable future. The industry has made significant strides in developing charging infrastructure to support electric trucks. Private investment, as well as support from government programs, is beginning to address the infrastructure challenge. Fueled by public and private funds, there are now around 183,000 public charging ports in operation within the U.S. as of Q2 2024–well on target to meet Biden’s administration goal of half a million public ports by 2030. The funds allocated under the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and the Charging & Fueling Infrastructure (CFI) Discretionary Grants program are actively being awarded and implemented. Three charging sites in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are already operational under NEVI, with 47 additional projects announced under CFI, which will deploy over 5,000 Level 2 chargers and more than 600 Level 3 fast chargers. Efforts led by other private groups solidify the future of public charging in the country. Notably, Forum Mobility will be deploying 1,000 DC fast chargers in California. Furthermore, Greenlane, a partnership between Daimler, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, to develop a nationwide network of high-performance charging stations starting with a 280-mile corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Recently, a group of carriers and shippers, which includes AIT Worldwide, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, PepsiCo, and others, have formed a coalition to pilot heavy-duty charging with Terawatt Infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. Advancements in battery technology are beginning to alleviate unfounded concerns from skeptics that site range anxiety remains a significant barrier to EV adoption in the commercial sector. Companies, including legacy manufacturers and new entrants like Daimler, Freightliner, Nikola, Tesla, and Windrose are leading the way with trucks that offer impressive ranges on a single charge. Tesla’s Semi truck promises a range of up to 500 miles with PepsiCo, one of the early adopters of the Semi, having successfully integrated these trucks into its fleet for regional distribution. Real-world data from Pepsi’s deployment has successfully accomplished a 1000+ mile journey in a single day, surpassing performance expectations and highlighting the vehicle’s long-range capabilities and efficiency. Another new entrant in the market is Windrose with their EV trucks offering upwards of a 400-mile range at full load. As per the Zero-Emissions Technology Inventory (ZETI) tool there are currently 21 different OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) offering 24 different EV van and truck models with a range of 200+ miles. While the sticker price of electric trucks is higher compared to traditional diesel trucks, as per BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2024, due to battery cost reduction and efficiency improvements, zero-emission trucks’ cost parity can be reached even sooner with the urban duty cycle becoming cost competitive before 2030. Furthermore, subsidies and tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act and public grants can help offset the upfront capital costs. Specifically, IRA provision 45W allows fleets to reduce the cost of an electric truck by up to $40,000, while provision 30C enables savings of up to 30% on the cost of installing charging infrastructure. Moreover, the total cost of ownership (TCO) savings outlook for electric trucks is further amplified due to savings on fuel and maintenance. Titan Freight Systems demonstrated these cost savings for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in a presentation at the ACT Expo 2024 showcasing 10% and 7% savings in these applications respectively. The savings will increase as more EVs are deployed since the cost of existing charging infrastructure will be spread across a larger fleet The growth of EVs and charging infrastructure in the U.S. can be likened to the growth of a bamboo shoot. After years growing deep roots with little visible growth above ground, bamboo suddenly shoots up rapidly, symbolizing how foundational work leads to swift, visible progress. Similarly, the EV industry initially experienced slow adoption, focused on building the necessary technology, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness. However, with these strong foundations now in place, thanks to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, NEVI, and other initiatives, the industry is experiencing rapid growth, much like bamboo’s sudden upward shoot. The EV industry’s steady groundwork is enabling companies in the U.S. to quickly expand their EV truck fleets, making significant strides toward sustainable transportation.

Title: Bitcoin advances timeline to replace fiat as the global reserve currency

Mounting global debt and technological advances push Bitcoin closer to mainstream integration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Four years on from the start of the COVID-induced global financial crisis, the global economy stands at a pivotal moment, characterized by moderate inflation and low unemployment yet overshadowed by uneven growth and escalating debt in advanced economies. Recent data from the G20 nations paint a complex picture of economic health, raising questions about the long-term viability of the fiat system and the potential rise of Bitcoin as a financial necessity. Inflation rates have generally stabilized in advanced economies. The Euro Area reports an inflation rate of 1.8%, the United States sits at 2.5%, and the United Kingdom holds steady at 2.2%, all hovering near central bank targets. These figures suggest effective monetary policies are maintaining price stability without severely restricting economic activity. However, stark contrasts exist in emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey, grappling with hyperinflation rates of 237% and 49.38%, respectively. Traditional monetary interventions in these countries have struggled to contain soaring prices, eroding public confidence in fiat currencies. Global interest rates further illustrate the divergent economic strategies. The United States and the Euro Area have reduced rates to 5% and 3.65%, respectively, aiming to stimulate growth amid signs of slowing economies. Japan continues its long-standing ultra-low rate policy at 0.25%. Conversely, Argentina and Turkey have instituted exorbitantly high rates of 40% and 50% in attempts to rein in inflation, highlighting the limitations of conventional fiscal tools under extreme conditions. Economic growth is uneven across the globe. The United States shows robust GDP growth at 3%, bolstered by solid consumer spending and investment. Indonesia leads with a remarkable 3.79%, showcasing the vitality of specific emerging markets. In contrast, Germany and South Korea face slight contractions of -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, signaling potential structural issues and vulnerabilities to external shocks. Unemployment rates in advanced economies remain low, with Japan at 2.5%, the United States at 4.2%, and the United Kingdom at 4.1%. These tight labor markets could exert upward pressure on wages, potentially reigniting inflation if not carefully managed. Meanwhile, South Africa’s unemployment rate remains distressingly high at 33.5%, and Spain’s at 11.27%, reflecting persistent structural challenges requiring comprehensive policy responses. Critically, government debt levels raise critical concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is alarming at 255%, the United States’ at 122%, and Italy’s at 135%. While current low interest rates make these debt levels manageable, any significant economic downturn or increase in borrowing costs could exacerbate fiscal pressures, undermining confidence in fiat currencies. Against this backdrop, the concept of hyperbitcoinization—the point at which Bitcoin becomes the world’s dominant form of money (or value) —gains relevance. Quantitatively, the timeline can be envisaged in phases: Analyzing current economic indicators places us in the early to middle stages of Phase 2. The global fiat system, while functional, exhibits signs of strain from high debt burdens and uneven economic performance. Central banks have thus far maintained control over inflation and liquidity, but the persistent challenges highlight the gradual materialization of conditions conducive to accelerated Bitcoin adoption. Economic disparities, high debt levels, and the diminishing returns of traditional monetary policies in certain regions are increasingly challenging the stability of the global fiat system. While we are not yet at a point where Bitcoin is a required replacement for fiat currencies, current trends suggest a gradual shift toward its broader adoption. As economic pressures intensify and technological and regulatory landscapes evolve, Bitcoin’s role could transition from an alternative asset to a necessary component of the global financial architecture. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin will move closer to necessity in the hyperbitcoinization timeline. CryptoSlate will continue to monitor economic indicators, policy responses, and technological progress to provide clearer insights into this potential paradigm shift.

Election 2024 coverage presented by The likes of BlackRock and Franklin Templeton could see tokenized shares of their money-market funds pledged in trading after a major group under the aegis of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved guidelines for their use, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. A subcommittee of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee voted to pass the recommendations on to the full committee, which is expected to vote on the recommendations later this year, the report said citing two people familiar with the matter. The report did not reveal what the recommendations were but the mere action that they have been sent to the full committee could be seen as the next step. The CFTC did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment. BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is an example of how creating blockchain-based tokens of traditional investments such as bonds and funds is a fast-growing use case for the larger digital asset space. The BUIDL fund became the largest tokenized Treasury fund just six weeks after its late launch in March. It surpassed $500 million market value in July. The CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee includes BlackRock and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, the report said.

Title: BlackRock finalizes $500 million Recurrent Energy stake
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/blackrock-finalizes-500-million-recurrent-energy-stake-93CH-3646903
Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:12:46Z

NEW YORK - Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:CSIQ) announced the completion of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s $500 million investment in its subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, which was initially disclosed in January 2024. The final tranche of the investment was received this week, following an initial payment in June 2024. This investment gives BlackRock a 20% stake in Recurrent Energy on a fully diluted as-converted basis, with Canadian Solar retaining the majority share. Recurrent Energy is set to leverage the new capital to expand its project development portfolio, transitioning from solely developing projects to also owning and operating them, particularly in the U.S. and European markets. This strategic move aims to secure more stable long-term revenue streams in low-risk currencies and to extract greater value from its global project pipeline. The company, established in 2009, has developed, built, and connected over 11 gigawatts of utility-scale solar projects and 3.7 gigawatt hours of energy storage projects across six continents. Recurrent Energy's CEO, Ismael Guerrero, expressed confidence that the partnership with BlackRock reinforces their position in the renewable energy sector and underpins their commitment to delivering clean and affordable power. David Giordano, Global Head of Climate Infrastructure at BlackRock, echoed Guerrero's sentiments, highlighting the opportunity for Recurrent Energy to accelerate the growth of its solar and battery storage projects with the support of BlackRock's Climate Infrastructure Global Renewable Power Fund IV. The transaction is expected to bolster Recurrent Energy's capabilities in developing and managing utility-scale solar and energy storage projects worldwide. The company currently has more than 26 GWp of solar and 56 GWh of battery storage projects under development. This news is based on a press release statement and further details regarding the investment can be found in Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 23, 2024. In other recent news, Canadian Solar Inc. has experienced a series of financial adjustments following its second-quarter results. Roth/MKM reduced its price target for the company to $20, maintaining a Buy rating, while JPMorgan lowered its target to $14, keeping an Underweight rating. Both adjustments were influenced by a mixed financial performance, including a miss on earnings per share but alignment with consensus on revenue and gross margin figures. The company's second quarter was robust, with solar module shipments reaching 8.2 gigawatts and revenues hitting $1.6 billion. Its gross margin stood at 17.2%, showcasing the strength of the company's position in the clean energy market. Despite challenges such as global module pricing weakness and potential increased trade barriers, Canadian Solar's diversified business model, particularly its rapidly expanding energy storage segment, is expected to contribute to future growth. Recent developments also indicate that the company's third-quarter revenue and gross margin guidance fell short of expectations, leading to a downward revision of its full-year 2024 revenue guidance. However, despite these challenges, Canadian Solar's U.S. operations are meeting internal expectations with steady pricing, reflecting the company's proactive risk-sharing strategy against potential new anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs. These are recent developments in the company's performance and outlook. As Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: CSIQ) moves forward with its strategic investment from BlackRock, investors should consider some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro that shed light on the company's current position. Despite the recent positive news, InvestingPro data reveals that Canadian Solar's revenue growth has been negative, with a -18.28% decline in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip indicating that analysts anticipate a sales decline in the current year. The company's efforts to expand its project development portfolio through Recurrent Energy could be seen as a strategic move to counteract this trend. On a more positive note, Canadian Solar has shown a strong return over the last month, with a 27.84% price total return. This recent performance might reflect market optimism about the BlackRock investment and the company's future prospects in the renewable energy sector. It's worth noting that Canadian Solar operates with a significant debt burden, according to an InvestingPro Tip. This could explain the company's decision to seek external investment to fuel its growth plans. The infusion of $500 million from BlackRock may help alleviate some financial pressure and provide the necessary capital for expansion. For investors considering Canadian Solar's valuation, the company is trading at a low Price / Book multiple of 0.39, which could indicate potential undervaluation. However, this should be weighed against the company's financial challenges and growth prospects. InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Canadian Solar, providing a more comprehensive analysis for investors interested in delving deeper into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: CFTC to introduce tokenized funds – How will it impact financial markets?

Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:00:38Z

Here’s a look at how the adoption of tokenized collateral could impact financial markets. In a significant move aimed at enhancing portfolio diversification for investors and streamlining capital efficiency for fund managers, a subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has advanced its recommendations on the application of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in managing non-cash collateral. These guidelines, which focus on enabling registered firms to leverage DLT for holding and transferring tokenized assets, mark a critical step toward integrating blockchain solutions within traditional financial infrastructure. The recommendations have been passed to the full committee for further review. The initiative gained traction following reports by Bloomberg on the 2nd of October. This highlights the push to utilize tokenized shares of money-market funds from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton as collateral in trading activities. For those unfamiliar, the subcommittee pushing these advancements includes influential members like Citadel, Bank of New York Mellon, and Bloomberg LP, further underscoring the momentum behind tokenization in traditional financial sectors. That being said, if approved by the full committee later this year, the proposed recommendations could substantially drive the adoption of tokenized collateral within financial markets, offering companies enhanced capital efficiency in their operations. Notably, this development would benefit BlackRock’s BUIDL tokenized fund and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, two leading players in the tokenized U.S. treasuries space. For those unaware, BUIDL, according to data from rwa.xyz, dominates the market with over $518 million in tokenized assets, while FOBXX holds a significant share of $435 million. Together, these two funds represent nearly half of the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. treasuries market. Therefore, if the recommendations gain full approval, the use of tokenized collateral is expected to expand, with more businesses seeking capital efficiencies through tokenization. Remarking on the same, McKinsey in a recent report released on the 20th of June, noted, “Based on our analysis, we expect that total tokenized market capitalization could reach around $2 trillion by 2030, driven by adoption in mutual funds, bonds and exchange-traded notes (ETN), loans and securitization, and alternative funds.” They further added, “In a bullish scenario, this value could double to around $4 trillion, but we are less optimistic than previously published estimates as we approach the middle of the decade.” As expected, some firms, such as crypto prime brokers Hidden Road and FalconX, are already leveraging BlackRock’s BUIDL token as collateral. This highlights the growing adoption of tokenized assets in the financial sector. Aave recently proposed the GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the 26th of August, aimed at utilizing BUIDL shares to maintain its stablecoin peg to the US dollar. Similarly, stablecoin issuer Ethena Labs revealed plans for a new stablecoin, UStb, fully backed by BUIDL.

Title: What office meltdown? Developers see a shortage of high-end space and are rushing to build it.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/office-construction-demand-upcoming-shortage-real-estate-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-03T11:00:02Z
Full Content:
Office vacancy is at a record high in Washington, DC, and the city is regarded as one of the nation's most challenged markets — in part because of its heavy reliance on federal tenants that have continued to slim down their spaces. Yet Hilary Goldfarb, a senior managing director at Rockefeller Group who leads the company's Washington operations, has little doubt about the sleek 400,000-square-foot office property her firm is raising at 600 Fifth St. When the building is completed in mid-2026, Goldfarb said, she is "confident it will be full." "This is not hope as a strategy," she added, adding that half the project was pre-leased to the law firm Crowell & Moring. "It's based on real data and real activity," she said. Across the country, major office markets from New York to San Francisco have been pummeled by the lasting popularity of remote and hybrid work. Newly built, high-end offices, however, are finding takers. That demand has persisted even as office construction has been stifled by higher interest rates and inflation, which have pushed up building costs. Worries over the health of the office market have also made lenders reluctant to finance new development. About 30 million square feet of new office space is expected to be completed this year in the US, roughly half of what was built in 2019, before the pandemic, CBRE, a real-estate services firm, said. It projected deliveries would fall even further in 2025, to 14 million square feet. While the overall office market is awash in hundreds of millions of square feet of empty space, CBRE predicted that vacancy in the market's upper segment would drop to pre-pandemic levels by 2027 — about the same time projects that are breaking ground now are set to be ready. A growing number of office developers have taken notice and see a budding shortage they are eager to cater to. Large-office tenants, who often plan their space decisions years in advance, have also begun to recognize that while space options may abound now, they're likely to vanish in the coming years — raising interest in new development. "The last six, seven months, there's not just people coming kicking the tires; there's people that are really looking to engage," Scott Rechler, the CEO of RXR, said. He was referring to what he said was growing tenant interest in 175 Park Ave., a 2.8-million-square-foot skyscraper designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill that the developers RXR and TF Cornerstone are planning next to Grand Central Terminal in midtown Manhattan. The group now aims to begin construction on the more than $4 billion 1,575-foot-tall tower midway through 2025 and with significantly less pre-leasing than originally planned because of its growing confidence in demand. Asking rents at the tower are set to be above $200 per square foot, among the highest ever sought in New York City. "There used to be a point where we thought we would need to pre-lease all of it," Rechler said. "Now, we think that at 500,000 feet, it's probably enough to get going." Rechler said that interest in elite new space had been stoked by other high-end offerings in the market, such as One Vanderbilt, a recently built nearby tower, JPMorgan's new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., and a planned skyscraper at 350 Park Ave., which will house the investment firm Citadel. "If your competitors have a building like that that they're identified with and you're trying to be on a parallel path, you're going to say I want to be in a space at the same level or better," Rechler said. The large development firm Related Cos., meanwhile, says that four office towers it has built with Oxford Properties as part of their Hudson Yards megaproject are 99% full. The team is readying to begin a new 45-story 1.1 million-square-foot office property called 70 Hudson Yards next year. "We think we're going to be one of the only new buildings in '27, '28 when there's going to be no new supply," Philippe Visser, Related's president of office development, said. Even as overall office vacancy is at 15.1% in Manhattan, according to CBRE, Visser sees little competition between the overwhelming majority of that empty space and Hudson Yards, where a number of major corporate names have migrated in recent years to take occupancy of newly built buildings. Tenants include Wells Fargo, KKR, BlackRock, Meta, and L'Oréal. "All these successful companies who are looking for really dynamic office space want new construction," Visser said. The 70 Hudson Yards building is set to have various state-of-the-art features, including a triple-paned glass facade, which greatly enhances the insulating properties of glass exteriors and will make the building more energy-efficient and appealing to sustainability-conscious office users. In lower Manhattan, Larry Silverstein hinted that he's close to moving ahead with plans to erect the final office skyscraper at the World Trade Center, a 2.8 million-square-foot tower designed by the architect Norman Foster. Rumors abound that Silverstein is close to signing a large lease with American Express that would allow the project to proceed. "Just stay tuned" was all Silverstein would say about the possibility of a deal at the tower, 2 World Trade Center. He said he was certain other tenants would fill up the remainder of the building's available space once construction was underway. "When you put everything this building has all together, it's superior," Silverstein said. "It never left my mind that someday we would succeed in accomplishing tower two — and that's where we are today." Manhattan is particularly conducive to new construction because it has both a large captive audience of corporate-office users and a deep inventory of old, outdated office properties that have fallen out of favor. But because there's so little office construction on the horizon nationally, builders have begun to lay similar plans in other markets with similar dynamics. Visser, for instance, said Related expected to break ground on a 40-story 925,000-square-foot office tower at 725 W. Randolph St. in Chicago by next year. While that city is also awash in available space, the building would be one of the only available newly built office properties in the Fulton Market neighborhood, a desirable subdistrict in the city's West Loop known for its retail and restaurants, he said. Related Ross, a spinoff development firm launched earlier this year by Related's founder, Stephen Ross, is about to begin construction on 15 CityPlace, a nearly 500,000-square-foot office building in West Palm Beach, Florida. The project is about 70% pre-leased to an undisclosed roster of tenants, according to Jordan Rathlev, a senior vice president of development at the company. Rathlev said he recently received a space inquiry from a financial-technology firm that's seeking at least 300,000 square feet — far more than 15 CityPlace can accommodate. The interest from that tenant and others has given a boost to the company's ambitions to begin building a neighboring office property called 10 CityPlace that would also be about 500,000 square feet. "The intent is that they're both going at the same time," Rathlev said, indicating Related's hope that it will sign enough anchor tenancy at 10 CityPlace to build it and 15 CityPlace simultaneously. There is a yawning gap between the health of top-tier office space and the wider market, according to data from CBRE. The firm labels new and heavily renovated spaces that meet a host of quality measures as "prime" — a segment that encompasses only 8% of overall office inventory nationally. A net total of 49.3 million square feet of prime space was absorbed between 2020 and the first quarter of 2024, according to CBRE. About 170.3 million square feet of net vacancy accrued in the rest of the office market during that same period. Overall office vacancy nationally was 19.1% in June, close to a record level. Prime vacancy was 15.5%, and CBRE forecast that figure would drop by almost half, to 8.2% by 2027, its pre-pandemic average. "We believe that this absorption estimate is conservative and the prime vacancy rate could return to its pre-pandemic level sooner given continued job growth," Jessica Morin, CBRE's director of US office research, said. These top-of-the-market spaces, which charged a 60% premium before the pandemic, are 84% more expensive than competing spaces. With little supply, that differential could grow. Morin said: "8.2% is a healthy prime market and we expect rent growth in this tranche." Driving the solid metrics is a lack of new supply. While a total of 44 million square feet of office space is under construction, only about 17.3 million square feet of it, 39% of the total, is considered prime, according to CBRE. Eight million square feet of that is pre-leased, meaning that there is only about 10 million square feet of upcoming available top-quality space. Even with the tailwinds, financing high-end office construction remains a challenge. Banks have grown wary of lending to office projects, even those that are likely to be a financial success, because of broader concerns around declining values, increased foreclosures, and the potential for financial losses in the sector. As a result, Rechler said, RXR is considering "alternative strategies" to arrange financing for 175 Park Ave. "The scale of this project is of a level — I'm not sure you'd be able to get enough traditional banks, as an example, to be a lender," Rechler said. Rechler added that RXR had explored other routes to arrange the billions of dollars of debt necessary to fund 175 Park Ave.'s construction, including the municipal-bond market, in part because the project includes $500 million of transit upgrades to Grand Central Terminal. "I feel good," Rechler said, "that we'll have the right combination of pre-leasing and financing to begin next year." Jump to

Title: LVMH Strikes Landmark 10-Year Global Partnership with Formula 1
URL: https://www.luxuo.com/motoring/f1/lvmh-strikes-landmark-10-year-global-partnership-with-formula-1.html
Time Published: 2024-10-03T10:12:07Z
Full Content:
The deal brings brands like Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, and TAG Heuer into the global motorsport arena, marking a new chapter for LVMH and Formula 1. LVMH will be the official Global Partner of Formula 1 from 2025, in a landmark 10-year deal announced this week. The world’s largest luxury group has a number of relevant brands here, the group’s press release making special mention of Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy and TAG Heuer. This news is almost not newsworthy at all anymore because it has been gristle-clogging up the rumor meat processor for some months now. However, this remains one of the biggest news items in the world of luxury, if for nothing other than its sheer scale. The consensus on the value of the deal (undisclosed by LVMH or F1) is estimated at between USD 100 to USD 150 million a year, which only counts as small potatoes if you are BlackRock. Read More: LVMH’s L’Epée Acquisition Hints at Broader Strategy in Luxury Horology For some context, the LVMH group clocked revenues of EU86.15 billion in FY23, with a net income of EUR 15.17 billion. If the F1 deal had been in place then, net income would have been lower to the tune of 0.15 billion. To put it another way, any cost that is visible from this kind of cursory top-down look will make shareholders groan and reach for their Moët; we recommend the Dom Perignon 2003 vintage, in the David Lynch limited edition, if possible. So, what does LVMH gain from this? Details are about as scant as what is known of the activities of the Arnault family office but here is what the big guns said in the presser: “The people, the quest for excellence and the passion for innovation are at the heart of the activity of our Maisons and Formula 1,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO, of LVMH Group. “In motorsport as in fashion, watchmaking or wines and spirits, every detail counts on the path to success. Both in our workshops and on circuits around the world, it is this incessant search to break boundaries that inspires our vision, and this is the meaning that we want to bring to this great and unique partnership between Formula 1 and our Group.” Read More: New Frontiers: What to Expect from Julien Tornare at Hublot “In recent years, Formula 1 has truly become one of the most desirable sports in the world,” said Frédéric Arnault, CEO, of LVMH Watches. “It’s a vibrant discipline that echoes a number of values that are very important to us, such as innovation, team spirit and performance. For many years, several of our Maisons have also chosen to invest in Formula 1, whether to create unique experiences or for moments of celebration. With our Maisons and the expertise of our Group, we want to further grow this experiential dimension that Formula 1 provides all over the world. We are only at the very beginning of this partnership, but the seasons that await us promise to be extraordinary.” Read More: Frédéric Arnault’s Appointment Alerts Growing Importance of LVMH Watches The prominence of the younger Arnault in the reporting on this story across the board seems to indicate the degree of his involvement. In fact, he has been vocal in the past of the importance of Formula 1 to TAG Heuer in particular (when he was CEO of that brand) and was very public in his ambition to return the brand to pole position in the sport; TAG Heuer is currently partnering with the Red Bull Formula 1 team, which has been pretty good for the brand. Our retail friends in Singapore tell us that TAG Heuer typically sees a sales boost from racing season, and we have no reason to doubt this. Read More: TAG Heuer’s “Extreme” Ways On the other hand, a deal as massive as a global partnership is probably too big for TAG Heuer to swallow, without a bit of Moët to wash it down and Louis Vuitton to sew it all up; Morgan Stanley estimates TAG Heuer’s revenue at under USD 800 million in the last FY. Again, it is worth bearing in mind that this is not LVMH’s first rodeo. Most famously, Moët & Chandon was the champagne of record for the podium celebrations for years, and it was once synonymous with Formula 1. We have heard from industry insiders that champagne’s biggest name withdrew from the races because, well, they just used too much inventory. Read More: Could LVMH’s CEO Reshuffle Be The Key to Higher Long-Term Revenues? And then there is the matter of what role Louis Vuitton will play, as it surely must do. While it is fun to imagine all the drivers kitted out in Louis Vuitton flame-retardant suits, this is extremely unlikely. The story is still developing so we will return with more updates once they are confirmed. For more on the latest in luxury and motoring click here.

Title: Bitcoin Down To $60,000: Did Q4 2024 Lows Just Print?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-down-to-60000-did-q4-2024-lows-just-print/

Bitcoin is down at writing, slipping roughly 8% from September highs. After two days of losses, BTC is starting Q4 2024 on the wrong footing, with the real risk of prices sliding below $60,000 and back to September and August lows. One analyst on X is optimistic about the world’s most valuable coin, which is flat and hanging by a thread. In a post, the analyst said the recent setback should be seen positively. Moreover, the trader continued, Bitcoin, even with the pain holders faced in early October 2024, is likely printing Q4 2024. According to the analyst’s preview, Bitcoin tends to establish swing highs or lows early in the trading period, in this case, for Q4 2024. Although the escalations in the Middle East are disruptive, Bitcoin won’t be significantly impacted–a net positive for price. The trader expects liquidity to ramp up in the coming months, boosting prices. Bitcoin is down after an impressive September that saw prices climb higher, reaching $66,000. Historically, September is bearish for Bitcoin. However, by the end of September, it was up 7%, rejecting early losses and closing above a strong liquidation level at around $65,000 and $66,000. Optimism is high because Bitcoin is printing at the same price as in early August and September. Bitcoin prices had plunged to as low as $49,000 by the first week of August before recovering steadily in the next three weeks. In early September, prices again fell, dropping to as low as $52,000 before resuming the uptrend set in motion in August. It remains to be seen whether the events of early August and September will be replicated. However, optimism is high, and most BTC holders, according to CoinMarketCap sentiment analysis, are bullish. Over 60% of all voters expect BTC to edge higher, while 38% are bearish, expecting sellers to dominate. Possible tailwinds for bulls include the inflow of capital to spot Bitcoin ETFs. Soso Value data shows that when BTC prices fell on October 1, BlackRock bought over $40 million worth of coins. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Global management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Bain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Citi recently reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $245 price target. Analysts at the advisory issued an investor note following a third party seller event named Amazon Accelerate. The note detailed that the advisory was incrementally confident that Amazon's core retail segment would continue to gain greater wallet share as fulfillment efficiencies lowered overall cost to serve. With faster shipping speeds, the rise in essentials, and improving conversion rates, Amazon's core retail business would deliver continued share gains and expanding margins as Web Services demand accelerated, the note underlined. Overall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Global management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.

Bain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks. The research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.

A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 120 Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) makes and sells memory and storage products. The company recently announced the availability of a new solid-state drive that offers two times faster performance than the previous model. The new drive would give gamers, students and creatives a boost in speed when they boot and use data-intensive applications, per the company. The new solid-state drive has capacities up to 2 terabytes and read and write speeds of 7,100 and 6,000 megabytes per second respectively. The new offering expands the portfolio of Micron Technology to address PCs, laptops and PlayStation 5. Baird recently lowered the price target on Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock to $150 from $172 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The advisory said Micron expected its HBM share to hit parity with its overall DRAM market share in C2025, which was the crux of Baird's investment thesis on the stock given their views HBM could generate low-60%s gross margin while representing a 60% CAGR. Baird said the chipmaker remained one of their top ideas and valuation was attractive and the HBM opportunity was not fully priced in. Overall MU ranks 11th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
