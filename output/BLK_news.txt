Last week, Google revised its artificial intelligence principles, removing the company’s stance against using AI to develop weapons or technologies or directly facilitate injury to people, or for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms. Google’s AI head Demis Hassabis said the guidelines were being overhauled in a changing world and that AI should protect “national security”. RT has interviewed Dr. Mathew Maavak, a senior consultant for Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), scholar on global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and AI, on the potential consequences of Google’s new policies. RT: Does this mean that Google and other corporations will now start making AI-powered weapons? Dr. Mathew Maavak: First and foremost, Google was largely the creation of the US national security apparatus or simply, the “deep state”.The origins of many, if not all, Big Tech entities today can be traced to ground-breaking research undertaken by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its predecessor the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). So, the quasi-private entity called Google is inextricably beholden to its “national security” origins, as are other Big Tech entities. Weaponizing AI and creating AI-powered weapons is a natural progression for these entities. Microsoft has long established its own “military empire”. Furthermore, Big Tech platforms have been extensively used for data and intelligence-gathering activities worldwide. This is a reason why China has banned many US Big Tech software and apps. A nation cannot be sovereign if it is beholden to Big Tech! As for Google changing its guidelines on AI, this should not come as a surprise. Big Tech was actively promoting universal AI governance models through various high-profile institutional shills, United Nations agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), think tanks and national governments. Through my recent work in this field, it became abundantly clear that the US government sought to stifle the development of indigenous AI worldwide by promoting half-baked and turgid AI Governance models that are riddled with contradictions. The gap between lofty aspirations and longstanding realities are simply unbridgeable. The same playbook was deployed to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) schemes worldwide – imposing heavy costs on developing nations and corporations alike. Now, the US and Big Capital are ditching the very ESG schemes they had devised. Unfortunately, many nations fell for these ploys, investing significant money and resources into building fanciful ESG and AI frameworks. These nations risk becoming permanently dependent on Big Tech under what I call “AI neo-colonialism”. Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, Microsoft’s Bing and Elon Musk’s X have long weaponized their platforms before this recent change in AI policy. Big Tech’s search algorithms have been weaponized to erase dissenters and contrarian platforms from the digital landscape, effectively imposing a modern-day damnatio memoriae.I have to use the Russian search engine Yandex in order to retrieve my old articles. RT: Why is this change being made now? Dr. Mathew Maavak: All weapons systems increasingly rely on AI. The Russia-Ukrainian conflict alone has seen AI being used in the battlefield. The extensive use of drones, with possible swarm intelligence capabilities, is just one out of many anecdotal examples of AI usage in Ukraine. You cannot create next-generation weapons and countermeasures without AI. You cannot bring a knife to a gunfight, as the old saying goes. It must be noted that one of the most profitable and future-proof sectors, with guaranteed returns on investments, is the Military-Industrial Complex. Weaponizing AI and making AI-powered weapons is just a natural course of action for Big Tech. It is also quite telling that the leaders of the two AI superpowers — the United States and China — skipped the recent Paris AI Summit. The event devolved into a scripted talk shop orchestrated by Big Tech. Alongside the United Kingdom, the United States also refused to sign the declaration on making AI “safe for all.” Clearly, this event was staged to suppress AI innovation in developing nations while legitimizing the weaponization of AI by major powers. RT: Google’s ‘principles’, to begin with, are set by Google itself, are voluntary and non-binding under any law. So theoretically nothing was preventing the company from just going ahead with any kind of AI research it wanted. Why did it feel the need to make it “official”? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Google’s so-called “principles” were never determined by the company alone. They were a mere sop for public consumption, perfectly encapsulated by its laughably cynical motto: “Don’t be evil.” Its parent company Alphabet is owned by the usual suspects from Big Capital such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street etc. – all of whom are private arms of the US deep state. An entity like Google cannot conduct “any kind of AI research” as its activities have to conform to the diktats of its primary stakeholders. Google formalized its new weaponization policy because the public’s stake in its ownership pie is virtually nonexistent. RT: Is it time to come up with international laws regarding military AI – like Google’s principles before the recent change, but enforceable? Dr. Mathew Maavak: As I have alluded to earlier, various international AI Governance models – all of whom are pretty much a facsimile of each other – were surreptitiously-formulated by the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other members of the so-called Tech Bros. Nations were just given the illusion of having a stake in this global AI legal and ethics matrix. Bureaucrats merely rubber-stamped whatever Big Tech promoted through various actors and avenues. At the same time, dissenters to this travesty were systematically ostracised. They may however end up having the last laugh in a coming AI-linked SHTF event. (I will save this line of inquiry for another day). There are other vexing issues to consider here: How does one define “AI war crime” within an international legal framework? Is it even possible to come up with a universal consensus? The operator of an armed drone responsible for wiping out scores of civilians might pin the disaster on an AI glitch. The software running the drone itself may have algorithms sourced from various private entities across the world. Who should shoulder the blame in the event of a war crime? The operator, the vendor responsible for software integration or the entity whose algorithm was used or adapted for targeting? Realistically, it should be the antagonist nation but never bet the farm on restitution if the culprit happens to be the United States or a close ally like Israel. Last but not least, governments worldwide acted as co-conspirators in Google’s use of AI to censor dissenting scientific viewpoints and contrarian research findings during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they have effectively handed Big Tech permanent leverage to blackmail them. Furthermore, what do you think facilitates a welter of bioweapons research across 400-odd US military-linked laboratories worldwide? Gain-of-function microbial experimentation is not possible without AI. RT: AI tools in non-military areas of life, such as generation of texts or images, are still far from perfect. Isn’t it a bit early to rely on them in warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: The generation of AI texts and images can absolutely be used for warfare, and this is already becoming a significant concern in modern conflict scenarios. AI-generated content can be weaponized via AI-generated texts (propaganda, disinformation etc); AI-generated images/deepfakes (e.g. to subvert national leaderships/consensus); fake intelligence (e.g.create casus belli) and spoofing communications (e.g. subverting chain of command), among others. The possibilities here are simply endless! AI is evolving at an exponential rate. Yesterday’s science fiction is tomorrow’s reality! RT: As reported recently by the Washington Post, Google appears to have been providing AI tools for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of their Gaza campaign. Could the change in the company’s AI principles be linked to that? Dr. Mathew Maavak: I highly doubt it. The IDF’s use of Google’s cloud computing services and related tools (Amazon was teased as an alternative) may arguably be portrayed as the canonical starting point for the weaponization of AI. But why would the IDF want a multinational civilian workforce based in the United States to have access to its military operations? If Google provided AI tools to the IDF, it would have done so under directives from the US deep state. A nominally civilian entity cannot unilaterally supply sensitive AI tools for wartime use to any foreign power, allied or otherwise. Logically speaking, Google’s participation in the Gazan carnage should result in a massive boycott by member states of the Organization of Islamic States (OIC). But this will never happen as too many politicians, “technocrats” and academics in the OIC are beholden to US patronage. (The ongoing USAID scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, revealing the extent of international subversion at play). The rail guards of merit, bias and non-discrimination are also virtually non-existent in the OIC bloc, although they form the pillars of AI governance. All in all, AI principles as they currently stand, whether in civilian or military spheres, are nothing more than a paper tiger. RT: Again concerning the IDF, it has beenrevealed that a lot of the civilian deaths in Gaza were apparently not a result of poor AI tools, but of negligent human oversight. Perhaps military AI, when employed properly, could actually lead to more humane warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Honestly, I don’t think AI had played a significant role in the genocidal war in Gaza. The use of AI would have led to a targeted military campaign; not a mad, blood-stained blunderbuss of terror. This was no “oversight”; this was intentional! Compare Israel’s recent actions in Gaza to the relatively-professional military campaign it conducted in the same area in 2014 – when human intelligence (HUMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) played a bigger role vis-a-vis AI. Did AI dumb down the IDF or is AI being used as a scapegoat for Israel’s war crimes? The bigger question however is this: Why did the IDF’s AI-coordinated border security system fail to detect Hamas’ military activities in the lead-up to the October 7 2024, cross-border attacks? The system is equipped with multiple sensors and detection tools across land, sea, air, and underground — making the failure even more perplexing. In the final analysis, AI is being weaponized across all facets of human life, including religion, and US Big Tech is leading the way. Ultimately, under certain circumstances in the future, AI may be used to act as the judge, jury and executioner. It may decide who is worthy to live, and who is not. We are indeed living in interesting times. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT's current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin's current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale's bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin's stake in IBIT.

Title: Will Markets Go Up Now That Trump Is President?

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 8:30:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk.

Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. One of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats.

If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy.

Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration.

When Reagan got elected, we entered a recession—as it took some time to get inflation down and the economy growing. After a few years, when his policies took the stock market and the economy boomed. But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. ....policies took effect... But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. ************* I still can’t explain the 1987 crash. The market is historically very expensive now based on PE’s (lagging and forward) so it will take some time for earnings to catch up. It will certainly take some time for Trump’s policies to take hold. I’ve predicted the market will crash, and the media pundits will blame that on Trump and his policies, such as tariffs. *********************** Wall Street will try to blame tariffs, but their support of sanctions because of the Russia Ukraine War, were far more damaging to trade & the international economy. The Federal government collected $77 billion in tariffs in 2024, they might collect $90 billion in 2025. “Big Whoop.” Perhaps the left-wing loonies in the financial sector were hoping to crash the economy to sabotage Reagan; just like they are trying to do with Trump. Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. Expect the North Virginia real estate market to take a hit. With 75,000 federal employees accepting a buy out, there could be an unusually large number of homes hitting the market in a fairly short time-frame. Yes there isn’t anywhere else to go. Lots of money chasing overvalued assets RE: Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. So, what does that do for the Stock market? No idea. I was just calling attention to some economic data. The S&P went up 100% over the last 4 years. No it didn’t. The markets have been going up for the past 4 years. I guess they can keep going up. Gold is taking a major hit today! My poor portfolio! It’s not feelin’ the love this Valentine’s Day. Kemp and Reagan reluctantly accepted a compromise deal on the tax cuts, phasing them in over 3 years. This was a huge mistake, because businesses held off major capital transactions and investments until the final phase of the cut was in effect. Instead of a supply side stimulus, the economy ground to a halt for three years. Below is a piece of interesting trivia I’m putting here since it is economy-related: “In the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, CNN has mentioned “egg prices” 45 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, CNN NEVER mentioned “egg prices.” Over on MSNBC, in the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, they mentioned “egg prices” 80 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, MSNBC mentioned “egg prices” just 1 time.” They are absolutely SHAMELESS! When the Trump tax cuts are extended in the near future, they need to be made PERMANENT this time!

Title: Johnny O’Sullivan double eases Blackrock past St Michael’s into last four

Johnny O’Sullivan’s double was decisive as defending champions Blackrock College marched into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup semi-final at Energia Park on Friday afternoon with a comfortable win over St Michael’s in a repeat of last year’s decider. Despite the greasy ball, these schools looked to go wide early, trading crossfield kicks and the ambition to play at speed. Rock exposed space on the right, the feet of James Browne doing the trick and clean passing put Paddy Clancy on the ball, but his grubber just eluding the reach of Rhys Keogh. Blackrock narrowed their focus to go through the middle, with tighthead Sam Bishti showing surprising speed to test out St Michael’s centre Charlie McConnell. A knock-on was gratefully accepted by St Michael’s and their maul took them out of trouble and into enemy territory. Bernard White’s drive took him over the top of Cathal Lydon’s tackle where Owen Twomey’s groundwork enabled Ethan Black to strike the lead penalty in the 19th minute. Rock’s decision to keep the ball worked wonderfully, replacement Aiden Vetjens’s late line unlocking the defence to send Johnny O’Sullivan into the right corner for a 5-3 lead in the 19th minute. In a flash, sweet passing put Browne clear down the right where St Michael’s captain Duinn Maguire and Dan Ryan shunted the wing into touch. When the decision was taken to go wide, fullback Ryan was in place to intercept in another example of St Michael’s survival to the half-time whistle. . A sustained St Michael’s attack winkled out a penalty for Black to guarantee a 6-5 edge in the 39th minute, but they strayed offside to offer Paddy Clancy a shot at goal to make 8-6 in Rock’s favour in the 43rd minute. Blackrock struck for their second try after centre White’s hard line exploited a gap at the tail of the lineout. Clancy’s lob was then collected by Vetjens for the try, brilliantly converted by Clancy. Then, Clancy’s delicate ball over the top was collected by Joe Reddan and moved to White for the third try, converted by Clancy to make it 22-6 in the 57th minute. St Michael’s centre Black saw a pass slip forward for White to grab the intercept and Johnny O’Sullivan controlled the ball to speed away to the posts for his second try, which Clancy converted to put the game away. St Michael’s were quick to show character late on, implementing a maul strategy for Cian Walsh to drive over, with Black converting. SCORERS – Blackrock: J O’Sullivan 2 tries; A Vetjens, B White try each; P Clancy pen, 3 cons. St Michael’s: C Walsh try; E Black 2 pens, con.

Title: Elon Musk aims to remake the federal government by breaking it

UPDATED 11:12 EST / FEBRUARY 14 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof This week, it was all Elon, all the time. Let’s see: Musk offers to buy OpenAI (translation: gums up the works for Sam Altman’s attempt to turn OpenAI for-profit, since OpenAI’s board Friday rejected the offer). Makes Trump look like a babysitter for Musk’s four-year-old son prop at a press conference. Tries to cement his government coup via DOGE as judges remind him and Trump we’re (supposed to be) a democracy. Creates a cybersecurity nightmare in the process. Gets a $400 million federal bailout for his failed Cybertruck (for a few seconds). Did I miss anything? It’s now “Do whatever you want” with AI, for better or worse, at least in the U.S., as Biden’s AI rules got nixed and the U.S. refused to sign an international agreement on safe and inclusive AI. Meantime, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pledges more openness (we’ll see), and news organizations get more aggressive on copyright in a lawsuit against Cohere and note continuing problems with hallucinations. Paul Gillin dug into how venture capitalists view the AI investment environment post-DeepSeek, and guess what? It actually looks way more promising than some doomsayers suggested. AI chips are getting very hot. As OpenAI steamrolls ahead on new models, it’s also close to making AI chip in-house. And Arm is now reportedly looking at designing chips to sell itself, with Meta Platforms the likely first customer. Meanwhile, Intel stock rose more than 20% this week after U.S. pushed TSMC to operate its factories, but it’s far from a done deal. Hardware’s not dead, as HPE, Cisco and Juniper release new gear. Dell also could sell $5 billion worth of AI servers to Musk’s xAI. Oh, and Meta reportedly is about to go deep into robotics. Another big earnings week: Cisco, Supermicro, Confluent, Coinbase and Robinhood beat. Informatica sure didn’t, and its stock fell by a third. Palo Alto Networks fell on a disappointing outlook too. Overall it was a mixed bag — full results below. More cyber consolidation is coming, with Trend Micro on the block and CyberArk acquiring Zilla.

Having signed a new contract with Leinster and Ireland that will take him to the end of the 2027/28 season, Irish centre Garry Ringrose says that his plans are to become an even better player. The 30-year-old, who has won 65 Test caps since making his debut in 2016, establishing himself as an ever-present in Ireland’s midfield, said it was a privilege to stay in Dublin for another three years. Performance Director David Humphreys said at the announcement that he believed Ringrose’s better days were ahead. “That’s always what you’d be trying to aim to do,” said the outside centre. “I’m just delighted and feel privileged to be able to sign on for three years. It’s an unbelievable opportunity to work with some amazing coaches and then players that are keen to get better and improve. I’d be the same as that so massive opportunities ahead.” The competition for starting places in the Irish midfield with Bundee Aki, Robbie Henshaw, Ringrose and others has forced management into some rotation of the players with Ringrose having to be content with a starting from the bench against Scotland last weekend. “I think certainly as centres we’d be pretty open and relaxed amongst each other,” he said. “Over the last couple of years, we’ve all been challenged to play on any given week, either it’s rotation, injury, form, and what’s brilliant is it’s really competitive in training but then at the end of the day, certainly as a centre group, we just want to do our best to help the team win. “I don’t know if you ask myself, Bundee or Robbie at the moment that are rotating, and there’s a few guys that haven’t been in yet. That would be their answer as well. We’re all kind of on the same page from that perspective.” The former Blackrock College player was pleased with Ireland’s haul of 10 points from two matches against England and Scotland with Wales in Cardiff the team’s third challenge of the championship next weekend. “I mean to come away with 10 points from the first two games, we’re delighted from that perspective,” said Ringrose. “What’s been great is there’s been loads of good in the games, but then things we’re reviewing and looking back at and trying to get better at so we’re getting the best of both worlds I guess. To have 10 points in such a competitive group of teams, yeah we’re delighted.” Johnny Watterson is a sports writer with The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How To Safely Spend Your Retirement Savings
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevevernon/2025/02/14/how-to-safely-spend-your-retirement-savings/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Develop a realistic plan to safely spend your retirement savings Many retirees plan to spend their retirement savings quite frugally, according to a few recent reports and studies. For example, a recent survey report, To Spend or Not to Spend from Blackrock, shares that retirees prefer to keep their assets untouched and that just one in four survey respondents feel they need to spend the principal of their savings in retirement. According to the report, “For most, retirement is not a time to live it up, it is more important to feel financially secure.” Similarly, the 2024 Retirement Confidence Survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that more than one-third of retirees (38%) have a savings mindset, meaning they want to spend less and save for the future. If this mindset continues throughout life, some retirees might end up passing away with a lot of money in the bank, money they might have been able to spend and enjoy while they were alive. The Blackrock study identifies a few potential reasons for this phenomenon, including the possibility that retirees haven’t yet shifted their mindset from accumulating savings for retirement to spending money in retirement, that they’re afraid of outliving their money, or that they have a deep-seated fear they’ll experience a serious financial or health shock. While I don’t intend to chastise pre-retirees and retirees for being frugal, I do want them to know there’s a straightforward strategy they can use to safely spend their retirement savings. Appropriately, the strategy is called the Spend Safely in Retirement Strategy, and it’s based on robust research that I led at the Stanford Center on Longevity, in collaboration with the Society of Actuaries. We systematically analyzed and compared 292 retirement income strategies, using sophisticated analytical techniques. Two key metrics we used were the amount of lifetime retirement income you can expect as well as the amount of savings you can access at any point in time. Using these metrics, the Spend Safely Strategy (for short) compared favorably to the other 291 strategies we analyzed, many of which are much more complex. The Spend Safely Strategy is designed to withstand stock market crashes, and indeed, the financial turmoil caused by pandemic successfully stress-tested the strategy. The Spend Safely Strategy suggests developing sources of retirement income that will last the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. Then, it recommends you limit your monthly and annual spending to the amount of retirement income you expect to receive. To generate sources of lifetime retirement income, follow these three steps: If you want to preserve your retirement savings, the conservative RMD withdrawal rates might appeal to you. The rates are currently under 3% until age 66, under 4% until age 75, and under 5% until age 81. The Spend Safely Strategy is really a decision-making framework. You can customize it meet your own goals and circumstances. For example, you can make adjustments to achieve these goals: You can implement the Spend Safely Strategy in most IRAs or 401(k) plans, with or without the help of a financial advisor. If you work with an advisor, understanding the strategy can help you have an informed discussion with your advisor. The Spend Safely Strategy offers a realistic balance between frugality on the one hand and spending too much money and outliving your savings on the other. It may take some time and effort on your part to build your lifetime retirement income portfolio, but it’s a very good use of your time, considering that you should be planning to enjoy a retirement that lasts for 25 years or more.

Title: How To Find The Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25

Concept of mutual fund investment, showing with hands placing coins inside the piggy bank with ... [+] mutual fund sticker. With an ever-growing list of similar-sounding mutual funds to choose from, finding the best is an increasingly difficult task. How can investors change the game to shift the odds in their favor? There are at least 147 different Technology mutual funds and at least 588 mutual funds across eleven sectors. Do investors need 53+ choices on average per sector? How different can the mutual funds be? Those 147 Technology mutual funds are very different from each other. With anywhere from 26 to 317 holdings, many of these Technology mutual funds have drastically different portfolios with differing risk profiles and performance outlooks. The same is true for the mutual funds in any other sector, as each offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Consumer Non-cyclicals ranks first for stock selection. Utilities ranks last. I think the large number of sector mutual funds hurts investors more than it helps. Manually conducting a deep analysis for every fund is simply not a realistic option, exposing investors to insufficient analysis and missing profitable opportunities. Analyzing mutual funds, with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each mutual fund. As stated above, there can be as many as 317 stocks or more for one mutual fund. Figure 1 shows the top rated mutual fund for each sector. Figure 1: The Best Mutual Fund in Each Sector Best Sector Mutual Funds 1Q25 * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity Amongst the mutual funds in Figure 1, BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) ranks first overall, Fidelity Advisor Financials Fund (FIKBX) ranks second, and Fidelity Advisor Consumer Staples Fund (FIJCX) ranks third. Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX) ranks last. Why do you need to know the holdings of mutual funds before you buy? You need to be sure you do not buy a fund that might blow up. Buying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the mutual fund’s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF FUND’S HOLDINGS – FEES = PERFORMANCE OF FUND BlackRock Energy Opportunities Fund (BACIX) is not only the top-rated Energy mutual fund, but is also the overall top-ranked sector mutual fund out of the 588 sector mutual funds that my firm covers. The worst mutual fund in Figure 1 is Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (HGASX), which gets an Unattractive rating. One would think mutual fund providers could do better for this sector.

Title: The New Dawn Of Tokenization

Time Published: 2025-02-14T14:30:00Z

Charles Morey, CEO, MobilEyes Inc. In a world where technology is reshaping finance, tokenization emerges as a transformative force, enabling companies to raise capital without sacrificing equity. Through my work with tokenization strategies, I’ve seen its power to unlock non-dilutive IPOs and revolutionize taxation, equity structures and wealth distribution. By turning customers into stakeholders, tokenization is reshaping industries and redefining ownership. As this innovation paves the way for an inclusive financial future, we must address challenges before AI and robotics reshape the job landscape. At its core, tokenization converts real-world assets or rights into digital tokens on a blockchain. Tokens represent ownership or claims on assets, offering unmatched liquidity, transparency and security. Unlike traditional shares or bonds, tokenized assets are programmable for governance, revenue sharing and compliance. Here are some examples of tokenization in action: • Real Estate: Instead of purchasing an entire property, investors can buy fractionalized tokens that represent a share of ownership, earning proportional rental income and capital appreciation. According to ScienceSoft, "By 2030, the global market for tokenized real estate will reach up to $3 trillion and represent 15% of the real estate assets under management." • Art And Collectibles: High-value art and collectibles are being tokenized to allow broader participation by fractionalizing ownership. • Tokenization Of Capital: Companies can monetize future revenues or assets without issuing additional equity, avoiding shareholder dilution. For example, Janus Henderson’s Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund tokenized $11 million, allowing real-time trading and improved liquidity via blockchain. With major firms like BlackRock adopting this approach, tokenization is unlocking new market access, reducing costs and enhancing transparency. Traditionally, an initial public offering (IPO) involves selling shares of a company to the public, diluting existing shareholders' equity. Tokenization enables a new approach: • Tokenized Revenue Streams: Companies can tokenize future revenues to provide liquidity without sacrificing equity, a revolutionary approach that allows startups to preserve founder stakes while attracting long-term investors. The World Economic Forum (via HSBC) predicts that up to 10% of global GDP, or $24 trillion, could be transacted via distributed ledgers by 2027, underscoring tokenization's immense potential. Additionally, firms can tokenize assets like intellectual property, patents or renewable energy credits, creating collateralized growth opportunities and unlocking innovative funding mechanisms. • Tokenized Assets For Collateralized Growth: Firms can tokenize intellectual property, patents or even renewable energy credits to secure funding. Consider a tech startup with exponential growth potential but is wary of diluting its visionary founders’ stakes. By offering tokenized revenue participation rights, the startup can access capital while incentivizing long-term investor engagement. Tokenization combats predatory lending practices that burden startups with high-interest loans. In a press release published last year, the FTC described two separate cases that show how deceptive lending costs small businesses millions of dollars. The FTC settled $59 million in claims against companies exploiting the Paycheck Protection Program. Tokenization provides a fair, transparent alternative. In a different example, the FTC took decisive action against a company operating under the name "Seek Capital," which falsely marketed itself as a provider of business loans. Tokenization does more than reshape fundraising; it redefines taxation and compliance frameworks: • Transparent Taxation: Blockchain technology streamlines tax compliance by enabling real-time, automated tax calculations and reporting, reducing errors and compliance burdens. PwC highlights how blockchain can automate business rules, expedite VAT refunds and enhance audit efficiency, significantly cutting costs. • Tokenized Tax Credits: Industries like renewable energy and agriculture could tokenize tax credits, creating liquid markets for businesses to buy and sell these benefits efficiently. In a tokenized world, opportunities for wealth creation become more equitable and accessible. Tokenized structures can: • Democratize Access To Investments: Tokenization enables everyday investors to access asset classes once limited to the wealthy. According to Boston Consulting Group, tokenized assets under management could reach more than $600 billion by 2030, unlocking opportunities and fostering inclusivity in financial markets. • Enable Crowdsourced Public Goods: Governments could issue tokenized bonds linked to specific infrastructure projects, allowing citizens to invest directly in community improvements. • Empower Underserved Communities: Imagine Native American tribes tokenizing land rights to secure capital while preserving sovereignty. Through tokenization, I aim to create a new paradigm where businesses harness non-dilutive capital solutions and where individuals reap the financial benefits of assets previously beyond their reach. For example: • Pre-IPO High-Yield Accounts: Companies meeting specific tokenization standards could offer high-yield investment accounts that grow in value over five to 10 years, rewarding investors while increasing enterprise value. • Dividend Tokens: Token holders receive dividends linked to crypto or real-world profits, incentivizing long-term participation and stability. • Automated Compliance/Wealth-Building Mechanisms: Smart contracts tied to tokenized revenue streams could manage compliance, automate dividends and even distribute carbon credits. Tokenization’s impact will extend beyond finance into societal transformation: • Public Safety: Systems like my patent-pending MobilEyes platform could tokenize compliance data, creating incentives for transparent law enforcement and real-time public accountability. Research from SoundThinking shows that 42% of Americans believe a lack of transparency harms trust in law enforcement. • Music And Creative Economies: Tokenized royalties could ensure artists are paid instantly and fairly, cutting out intermediaries. The revolution of tokenization is here, and its potential to reshape sectors, industries and individual prosperity is limitless.

Title: Bitcoin's 2024 Return Against Equities
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/02/14/bitcoins-2024-return-against-equities/

2024 Returns and Volatility Bitcoin fared quite well in 2024 against traditional assets like bonds, gold, real estate, and the equity market as a whole. But how does it compare to individual stocks? This matters for stock pickers, and for framing Bitcoin in terms of other major technological movements in the economy. Bitcoin had an annual 2024 return of 114%. The return and volatility are both much higher than the asset classes of bonds, real estate, gold, and the entire equity market. However, the risk-adjusted winner of 2024 was Palantir (PLTR), which captured a return of 353% and a slightly higher volatility than BTC. MicroStrategy (MSTR) came in close second, finishing out at a return of 338%, but at a much higher volatility. MicroStrategy would have handily beaten PLTR in November when its return YTD was 497%, but MSTR shed much value in the last six weeks of the year from aggressive bitcoin buying, powered by equity dilution. Even Nvidia (NVDA) offered a higher risk and return, with an annual return in 2024 of 187%. The major tech companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta) all offered lower risk and lower returns to Bitcoin. You can see that Bitcoin generally sits on the capital market line of risk and return, with MicroStrategy on one end and government bonds (GOVT) on the other. PLTR is an outlier, but so are companies like Tesla, Coinbase, and Marathon, which all offered lower returns and greater risk. Even the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) roughly matched Bitcoin’s return, but it was more volatile. Now, let’s take a look at a broader universe of equities. Let's sample the companies in the S&P 500 above a $10 billion market cap. A random sample of these companies on the risk and return chart looks like: 2024 Returns and Volatility Again, notice the pattern. Some companies have higher returns than Bitcoin in 2024, but also higher risk, like Nvidia and Palantir. Other companies have less return and less risk, like Disney and Nike. Some are strictly worse, with greater risk but lower return, like Tesla and Micron Technology. There was one company in the S&P 500 that offered a better deal than Bitcoin, with lower risk and greater return. To find it, here's a sample of the companies from the S&P 500 without the $10 billion minimal market capitalization threshold: 2024 Returns and Volatility Here you can see that Sea Limited had an annual return of almost 200%, and a volatility just shy of Bitcoin’s. Have you heard of Sea Limited? Neither have I. So, indeed there may be a better investment than Bitcoin in any one year. But the chances of finding this one company among 500 is small. This proves my point that Bitcoin really is an asset class, not just another single investment. And its risk and return should be compared to other asset classes, not just to other single stocks.

The fee reductions are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone,” it said in a statement. Lower costs leave more money in investors’ hands and raise their potential returns. Indeed, across the industry, lower-cost funds have historically outperformed higher-cost funds on a net-of-expenses basis, Vanguard reasoned. The average asset-weighted expense ratio would be just 0.07 per cent for Vanguard across its $10 trillion under management — a sliver of the industry average of 0.44 per cent, said a Bloomberg report. It’s going to be a catch-22 situation for its rivals such as Blackrock, Invesco and State Street Corp on whether to follow suit at the cost of their profits. Between 2004 and 2023, the asset-weighted average expense ratio fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.36 per cent, according to Morningstar Inc, that tracks the performance of mutual funds globally. In India, SEBI allows slab-based total expense ratios for various categories of schemes, such as equity, debt, hybrid, and solution-oriented funds. Accordingly, equity funds can charge up to 2.25 per cent, non-equity schemes can charge up to 2 per cent as the base expense ratio. SEBI has been working hard to bring down expense ratio. It, in fact, had suggested calculating TER including brokerage fee and GST on management fee at the asset management company level rather than at the scheme level. “This approach was aimed to provide a more holistic view on expenses incurred by mutual funds,” SEBI had then said. The regulator, however, put this proposal on hold after feedback from MF industry body AMFI. The consultation process is currently going on. As per SEBI study, the industry average TER, including additional expenses charged by the regular plan of different open-ended schemes during the financial year 2021–22, stood at 2 per cent for equity schemes, 0.77 per cent for debt schemes, 1.88 per cent for hybrid schemes, and 0.11 per cent for ETFs. This ratio has further slipped currently. For instance, the TER has slipped to 1.4 per cent in January. According to SEBI, retail investors invested more than 57.18 per cent of their investment in equity schemes and 17.49 per cent in hybrid schemes and the remaining 25.33 per cent in debt schemes, ETFs and other schemes such as index funds, solution oriented schemes, fund of funds, and so on. The AUM of the Indian MF industry has grown from ₹11.81 trillion as on January 31, 2015 to ₹67.25 trillion as on January 31, 2025 more than 5-fold increase in a span of 10 years. According to SPIVA Global (S&P Indices Versus Active), the first half of 2024 proved to be a particularly challenging market environment for active managers across global equity markets, as the outperformance of the very largest companies resulted in a high proportion of index constituents underperforming the benchmark return. In India, 77 per cent of actively managed Indian Equity Large-Cap funds trailed the S&P India LargeMidCap’s total return of 17.4 per cent at the end of June 2024. At 52 per cent, It is relatively better for mid/small-cap funds underperformed the S&P India SmallCap’s and 94 per cent of Indian Composite Bond funds and 74 per cent of Indian Government Bond funds lagged the 5.3 per cent return of the iBoxx ALBI India. However, it is interesting to see, in the current downtrend, how many mid and small-cap schemes have managed to outperform the respective indices. The probability of a greater number of schemes underperforming the indices is higher given the constant selling pressure in that space. In this scenario, lower expense ratio would no doubt enhance the return for the investors. With more and more players such as Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International, Cosmea Financial Holdings, Angel One and Unifi Capital entering the AMC space, one could hope for further lowering of cost due to competition and growth in AUM.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 4:53:51 AM PST by MtnClimber U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change.

These globalists are only interested in the revolution, not shareholder value. Rapidly increasing electric rates seem to be a thing in the midwest and near west. I do not understand, we have made our wind investments, kept our power plants open, the grid isnt a fire hazard and have low natural gas prices at the exchange points. If inflation would just take a break the constant rate increases could be rejected, but at this point nobody can say that the power companies are to far ahead of the facts. I’d suggest you provided part of your answer: “we have made our wind investments” Yeah. Oh what a day! Here in Alabama, we are enjoying being on the list I saw on the tube the other day as the 5th highest electric bills in the nation. Wow. Our average bill, we are on the program where we pay the same every month and they adjust our bill every few months based on our usage, has jumped by $75 per month. And we are doing all we can to hold our usage down. The 9 degrees temps we had a couple of weeks ago did not help!! Bama ain’t use to 9 and 12 degree temps. Ave in Jan is usually 53 high and 32 lows. Highs of 31 and lows of 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22, are NOT usual here. Most electricity is generated by natural gas, and the price has been going up since 2023-4. Regulated utilities are by law entitled to make a “reasonable” profit, in order to continue to function and produce vital services. “Climate change” heating up the globe yet again. I’m not sure what “low” nat gas prices is, either. If NG is going up, then so is electricity. The last administration fought tooth-and-nail to prevent NG capacity to increase. Also, building growth is an issue. All being equal, if demand goes up 11%, so does the price. They’re developing all around me - farm land being turned into houses and I expect that the power companies do nothing to expand capacity and just raise the prices. BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. This is getting ridiculously expensive. At least natural gas works! ping Everything is going as planned. As I see it, most folks with electric power usually got it from a power plant in the vicity. Then along came this solar & windpower. Well, somebody has to recoup the expense of building these thing & I suspect they are especially expensive to build, particularly the wind generators. Of course the solar units must be converted to AC. Extra lines are put in to hook up to these part-time poer units. So now you are paying for one or two Part-time power producing units. Sometimes the STANDARD power plants must be cut back so you don’t have an over-abundance of electruicity. I think this also has it’s own cost in efficiency. So when you add up all the extra power-producing units, there is naturally a higher cost. I think it’s better just going with full-timp power from a standard power plant, be it gas turbine, hydro-electric, or what ever else exists. “Green energy” is not full-time energy. Agreed. Everything is going as planned. *********** In your opinion ... “Who is doing all this planning?” “Under my plan … electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” - Hussein Obama Yep rates rise just as almost every other thing we use.

Title: Goldman Sachs Is Quietly Betting Billions On Bitcoin—Is Ripple’s XRP Next As Its Price Surges?

02/14 update below. This post was originally published on February 13 Bitcoin and ethereum have diverged in recent months, with the bitcoin price soaring as ethereum struggles—helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s predicted plans for bitcoin. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

The UK-based bank now holds 2,473,064 shares of IBIT, valued at $131 million as of December 31, as per the Thursday filing. The purchase took place during the fourth quarter, spanning October to December, and coincides with the post-election surge in the Bitcoin price, which is now trading at a price of $97,030.17, up 0.8% over the past day, per CoinGecko data. The filing shows that Barclays’ move follows a trend in institutional adoption of crypto-related products, with banking giants such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan also raking up Bitcoin ETF holdings in recent months. As BTC surged to a record high of $109,000 just before the U.S. presidential inauguration, big players are seized the opportunity to capitalize on the crypto’s rise without directly owning BTC itself. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it easier for these institutions to get exposure to BTC, while sidestepping some of the volatility and regulatory concerns surrounding direct crypto ownership. Goldman Sachs, for instance, reported a 121% jump in its Bitcoin ETF holdings, bringing its total stake to $1.57 billion. Banking giant JPMorgan recently reported an increase in its BTC fund exposure in its latest filing, which now totals $964,322. In January 2025, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive $5 billion in inflows, a trend expected to continue in 2025 with forecasts of over $50 billion in inflows, as per Farside Investors data. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest net inflows during January, pulling in $3.2 billion, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $1.3 billion. In January alone, IBIT pulled in $3.2 billion, making it the top-performing Bitcoin ETF of the month, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with nearly $1.3 billion in inflows. Analysts are predicting more gains for BTC in the coming years, with projections suggesting it could reach as high as $200,000 by late 2025. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Why ageless BlackRock boss Larry Fink has no plans to retire
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/business/why-ageless-blackrock-boss-larry-fink-has-no-plans-to-retire/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
One of the big questions on Wall Street is when Larry Fink, the long-time CEO and founder of money-management behemoth BlackRock, will decide to retire. The answer: Never, if Fink has his way. The CEO of the world’s largest asset-management firm has alerted his top people that he is sticking around for the foreseeable future, at least until BlackRock absorbs some $28 billion in new acquisitions it made in the past year or so intended to expand its footprint beyond plain-vanilla investing on behalf of clients, On The Money has learned. Fink’s plan to remain in his job without a clear retirement date is why one potential successor, Mark Wiedman, the managing director of the firm’s global client business, announced last month that he is leaving after around 20 years at the firm. Wiedman is 54, and Fink is a very healthy 72, or as one BlackRock insider told On The Money, “Larry has the energy of a 27-year-old, and he’s having the time of his life.” A company flack tells me succession planning is always being discussed by the BlackRock board, but if you know anything about this company, it’s Fink’s baby, and they report to him. He started BlackRock in 1988, after being jettisoned from the old First Boston Corp., following some significant trading desk losses. The firm was first an asset-management subsidiary of the Blackstone Group, one of the pioneers of private equity created by Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson. By 1992, Fink’s baby was growing exponentially (as was his ego that brushed up against the sizable one of Schwarzman’s), so much so that he bought himself out of Blackstone for a mere $300 million. Today, BlackRock has a market value of $150 billion and manages $11.6 trillion in assets. When asked about letting Fink and BlackRock go, Schwarzman once quipped that it was “the biggest mistake” he’s made as a CEO. Another reason it was a mistake for Schwarzman to let Fink go is that they are — thanks to those acquisitions — increasingly direct competitors, a little known fact on Wall Street except in the offices of both places. Blackstone is the king of the private equity business, with $1.1 trillion in assets taken private that will at some point be sold. BlackRock has been mainly a manager of other people’s assets, a so-called passive investment adviser that sells stuff like exchange traded funds and advises public pension funds here and abroad. But there is a BlackRock-Blackstone war going down, with the former encroaching on the latter’s turf. Last year, BlackRock bought private credit firm HP Partners, which provides loans to businesses. BlackRock now has two PE platforms, and it offers banking services to general partners of private equity outfits. It has teamed with PE firm Partners Group to offer investors access to this lucrative market. I know what you’re saying, isn’t Larry Fink “Mr. ESG,” the acronym for the controversial, and woke Environmental Social Governance investing? He was. Little secret: ESG makes up a $1 trillion of BlackRock’s $11 trillion in AUM, and much of it comes from overseas investors. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Fink used to talk up ESG. No longer after he took a lot of grief from Red State pols, including those who run pension funds in places like Texas and Florida, he has since been downplaying ESG here in the US. That combined with some savvy lobbying from his government affairs team has quelled a lot of the Red State anger. Not being a target of conservative scorn has its benefits: Fink is focused on the business. Earnings are up, as is his AUM, as On The Money previously reported He’s expanding into crypto ETFs and increasingly, competing against his old pal, Schwarzman. And he doesn’t want to retire, because as an associate told me, “he’s having too much fun.” Advertisement

Title: Different Ways to Invest in Gold Explained

Gold IRA February 14, 2025 We research all the brands mentioned and may receive a fee from our partners. Research and financial concerns may impact how brands are presented. Not every brand is included. Learn more. Let’s not waste any time. I’ll be covering the different ways you can invest in gold. As an American, you have several options for investing in gold, depending on your goals, risk tolerance, and whether you prefer physical or paper gold. Here are the main ways you can invest. But first: Looking to protect your investments from inflation? Diversify your portfolio with a Gold IRA. Secure your assets by investing in gold coins, bars, and bullion. Starting is simple – click on your state now and take the first step toward a more secure financial future! Look, if you’re investing in gold, you’re doing it because you understand one fundamental truth: paper money is a joke. The government prints it like Monopoly cash, inflation robs you blind, and the banking system? A house of cards waiting to collapse. You want something real, something tangible—gold. Bullion is just a fancy word for gold bars and coins, and this is where serious investors park their money. Why? Because bullion holds its value when everything else crumbles. What’s the catch? Great, you’ve got some gold. Now what? You can’t just stuff it in a sock drawer and hope for the best. Step one: don’t be an idiot. There are a lot of scammers out there preying on people who don’t do their research. You don’t just sit on gold forever. At some point, you’ll want to cash out. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are basically the participation trophy of gold investing. You don’t actually own gold—you own a paper representation of gold. It’s like saying you have a pet lion because you watched a National Geographic documentary. But hey, some people don’t want to deal with safes, security, or actually holding real gold. If that’s you, then ETFs are the easiest way to get in on the gold game. A Gold ETF is a fund that tracks the price of gold. You buy shares, and those shares are supposed to represent actual gold that some financial institution (probably one you don’t trust) is holding in a vault somewhere. The most popular ones: The idea is simple: Instead of buying and storing gold yourself, you buy shares in a fund that does it for you. Sounds great, right? Well… not so fast. ✅ Easy to Buy & Sell – Unlike physical gold, you can trade ETFs instantly on the stock market. No haggling with dealers. No waiting for delivery. Just click and you own (sort of) gold.✅ No Storage Hassles – No safes, no vaults, no worrying about someone breaking into your house and making off with your stash.✅ Lower Transaction Costs – No dealer markups, no shipping fees, no getting ripped off by pawn shops when you sell.✅ Can Be Held in an IRA – If you want to hedge your retirement savings with gold, ETFs are an easy way to do it inside a tax-advantaged account. So yeah, ETFs give you exposure to gold without the headaches. But now let’s talk about the ugly side of ETFs—because there’s plenty. 🚩 You Don’t Actually Own Gold – Let’s be crystal clear: Owning a Gold ETF is not the same as owning physical gold. If the system collapses, you’re holding a digital number on a screen, not something you can barter with. If you don’t hold it, you don’t own it. Period. 🚩 Counterparty Risk – When you own gold in your hands, you don’t have to trust anyone. With an ETF, you’re trusting banks, fund managers, and custodians—aka, the same people who mismanage money, rig markets, and gamble with your savings. If something goes wrong, guess who gets left holding the bag? (Hint: It’s not them.) 🚩 Redemption Is a Joke – Most Gold ETFs do not let you redeem your shares for actual gold. That means even if the fund does hold physical gold (which you’re just taking their word for), you’ll never see a single ounce of it. Instead, when you sell, you get paid in cash—which, again, is just paper money. 🚩 Fees Eat Into Your Gains – GLD charges an expense ratio of about 0.40% per year. Doesn’t sound like much, but over time, that adds up. And unlike physical gold, which just sits there gaining value, ETFs bleed a little money every year just for existing. 🚩 Government Control – Here’s a fun fact: The government can freeze your brokerage account anytime it wants. Think it can’t happen? Ask the Canadians who had their bank accounts locked for donating to the trucker protests. If things get bad enough, your Gold ETF won’t save you. Look, I’ll be fair—Gold ETFs aren’t useless. They’re a decent option if you:✅ Just want short-term exposure to gold prices without dealing with physical storage.✅ Are a trader looking to capitalize on gold price movements.✅ Want a gold hedge inside your stock portfolio. But if you’re investing in gold because you actually care about protecting wealth, hedging against collapse, or securing your financial future, physical gold is the only real option. Gold mutual funds are bundles of investments related to gold, usually a mix of mining stocks, gold ETFs, and sometimes actual gold bullion. You put your money in, and some fund manager—who takes a cut, by the way—decides how to invest it for you. Examples: Why do people buy these? But Here’s the Problem: 🚩 You Don’t Own Gold – Again, you own paper assets linked to gold. When the system breaks down, what good is a mutual fund statement? 🚩 Fees & Middlemen – The fund manager gets paid whether you make money or not. If gold skyrockets, they profit first. 🚩 Stock Market Exposure – These funds are tied to mining companies, which means they rise and fall with the stock market, not just gold prices. If the economy tanks, mining stocks can crash even if gold goes up. 🚩 Government Regulation – The SEC, the IRS, and every other three-letter agency has their hands all over these. If things go south, mutual funds can be frozen, taxed, or “restructured” (a nice way of saying you get screwed). Now, if gold mutual funds are for passive investors, gold futures are for the adrenaline junkies who think betting their savings on short-term gold prices is a good idea. A gold futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell gold at a future date at a set price. You don’t have to own gold—you’re just betting on whether the price will go up or down. ✅ Leverage – You control a large amount of gold with a small amount of money.✅ Short-Term Profits – If you time it right, you can make a lot of money fast.✅ Liquidity – Futures are heavily traded, so you can buy and sell quickly. Why Gold Futures Are Insane for Most People: 🚩 Extreme Risk – Gold futures are a zero-sum game. If you win, someone else loses. If you lose, you lose big. Most retail traders get wiped out. 🚩 Margin Calls – If the market moves against you, you have to put up more money. Fast. If you can’t, your position is liquidated, and you’re left with nothing. 🚩 No Physical Gold – Once again, this is just numbers on a screen. If the financial system collapses, do you really think your futures contract is going to protect you? 🚩 Big Players Control the Market – Hedge funds, banks, and institutions dominate the futures market. They have insider knowledge, algorithms, and the ability to manipulate prices. You don’t. If you’re investing in gold because you want real security, neither of these options should be your first choice. Gold Mutual Funds and Gold Futures are just Wall Street’s way of keeping you trapped in their system—where they get their fees and take their cut, while you hold an IOU for gold that you’ll never see. Real gold? That’s what kings, governments, and smart people hold.Paper gold? That’s what they sell to the masses. So ask yourself: Do you want to own gold, or do you want to play Wall Street’s gold games? Alright, let’s talk about Gold IRAs—because if you’re planning for retirement and you don’t have some of your money in gold, you’re doing it wrong. Here’s the reality: The U.S. dollar is a ticking time bomb. The government prints money like a drunk teenager with a credit card, inflation is eating away at your savings, and politicians—both parties—have no interest in fixing the mess. So, what do you do? You put your retirement savings into something that actually holds value. And that’s exactly what a Gold IRA does. A Gold IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a self-directed IRA that lets you hold physical gold instead of just stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead of trusting Wall Street with your future, you invest in something real—gold, silver, and other precious metals. You’re still getting the tax advantages of a regular IRA, but instead of hoping your stocks don’t crash right before retirement, you own actual gold that holds value no matter what happens. ✅ Hedges Against Inflation – While your dollars become worthless, gold keeps its purchasing power. 50 years ago, $35 bought you an ounce of gold. Today, that same ounce is worth nearly $2,000+. That’s how you keep wealth intact. ✅ Protects You from Government Stupidity – If the economy crashes, if banks fail, if another bailout happens (and it will), your 401(k) full of stocks could get wrecked. A Gold IRA keeps your savings in a real asset that politicians can’t just print more of. ✅ Tax-Advantaged Growth – Just like a traditional IRA, you can defer taxes on your gains. With a Roth Gold IRA, you pay taxes now but never again—so when gold skyrockets, your profits are 100% tax-free. ✅ Diversification That Actually Works – Wall Street tells you to “diversify” by buying 30 different stocks… all of which can crash at the same time. Real diversification means owning something outside of the stock market—like gold. ✅ You Own It, Not Some Bank – Unlike Gold ETFs or mining stocks, where you’re trusting paper contracts, a Gold IRA holds physical, tangible gold stored in a secure, IRS-approved depository. It’s yours. No counterparty risk, no Wall Street nonsense. It’s actually easier than you think—and if you already have a 401(k) or IRA, you can roll it over into gold. 1️⃣ Find a Gold IRA Custodian – You need an IRS-approved company to handle the paperwork and store your gold. Good options include: 2️⃣ Fund Your Account – You can roll over an existing IRA or 401(k) tax-free or make new contributions (subject to IRS limits). 3️⃣ Buy Approved Gold & Silver – Not just any gold works—IRS rules say you need to buy specific coins and bars, like: 4️⃣ Secure Storage – The gold is stored in a highly secure, IRS-approved depository. No, you can’t keep it under your mattress (IRS rules), but it’s your gold, sitting in a vault, completely safe. 5️⃣ Watch It Grow – Gold doesn’t pay dividends, but it appreciates in value while the dollar dies. And when you retire? You can either take a cash payout or have the gold shipped directly to you. 🚩 “Gold IRAs have storage and custodian fees!” ▶ Yeah, and so does a regular IRA or 401(k)—you just don’t see the hidden fees you’re paying to Wall Street. At least with a Gold IRA, you’re paying to store something real instead of gambling on stocks. 🚩 “Gold doesn’t generate income like stocks.” ▶ Gold’s job isn’t to pay dividends—it’s to preserve wealth. Stocks rise and fall, but gold holds its value for centuries. 🚩 “What if the government confiscates gold like in 1933?” ▶ If that happens, trust me, the economy is so far gone that nothing will be safe. But Gold IRAs are still a smarter bet than hoping Wall Street takes care of you. Alright, let’s get something straight right now—if you don’t hold the gold in your hands, you don’t own it. Period. End of discussion. And yet, we’ve got this new trend—Digital Gold. It sounds fancy. It sounds modern. But let’s call it what it really is: a digital IOU for gold that you’ll probably never see. Let’s break this down. Digital Gold is a system where you buy fractional ownership of gold stored in a vault somewhere—but instead of getting the actual gold, you get a digital certificate or balance that says you “own” it. Popular platforms include: The idea is simple: Instead of dealing with the “hassle” of storing real gold, you just trust some company to hold it for you while they give you a number on a screen. Sounds familiar? Yeah, that’s because it’s basically a glorified bank account. ✅ Fractional Ownership – You can buy tiny amounts of gold, even a few dollars’ worth, which makes it accessible. ✅ No Storage Hassle – You don’t need a safe, a vault, or a hidden compartment in your house. The gold is “securely stored” for you (so they say). ✅ Fast Transactions – You can buy and sell instantly, unlike physical gold, which takes time to sell and ship. ✅ Can Be Used for Payments – Some digital gold platforms even let you “spend” your gold like cash. Because apparently, gold is too “old-fashioned” now. Alright, sounds nice, right? Yeah, until you realize the entire thing is built on trust. 🚩 YOU DON’T ACTUALLY OWN THE GOLD – Let’s get one thing clear: Digital Gold is not the same as holding physical gold. You’re trusting some company to store it for you, and if they go bankrupt, get hacked, or decide to freeze your account, good luck getting your gold. 🚩 COUNTERPARTY RISK – When you own real gold, you don’t have to trust anyone. When you own digital gold, you’re trusting a company, a vault, and a bunch of middlemen to not screw you over. And if history has taught us anything, middlemen always screw you over. 🚩 WITHDRAWAL RESTRICTIONS – Many digital gold platforms make it incredibly difficult to actually take physical delivery of your gold. There are minimum withdrawal amounts, high fees, and long wait times. In other words, they’ll sell you “gold” all day long, but when you ask for the real thing? Suddenly, there are rules. 🚩 GOVERNMENT CONTROL – What’s stopping the government from regulating or seizing digital gold platforms? Nothing. Your account can be frozen, your assets can be taxed, and suddenly, your “gold-backed” investment isn’t so secure anymore. 🚩 CENTRALIZATION DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF GOLD – The whole point of gold is freedom from the financial system. Digital Gold just locks you back into it. It’s basically a digital fiat currency dressed up as gold. Let’s be real—if the economy crashes tomorrow, Digital Gold is just another number on a screen. You know what people will actually trade? Real, physical gold. Look, I get it. Digital Gold sounds convenient. It’s easy, it’s fast, and it feels like “owning gold” without the “hassle.” But that’s exactly the trap. The whole reason you invest in gold is to get out of the system—not to get trapped in another version of it. If you want to actually protect your wealth, here’s what you do:🚨 BUY REAL GOLD. 🚨 STORE IT YOURSELF. 🚨 DON’T TRUST THIRD PARTIES. It’s that simple. Don’t fall for the Digital Gold illusion. Because when things go south, the only gold that matters is the gold in your hands. If you have zero faith in the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, or the financial system, congratulations—you’re paying attention. A Gold IRA is one of the smartest ways to protect your retirement from inflation, stock market crashes, and the reckless policies that are destroying the dollar. Gold is real. Gold is lasting. Gold is what nations, billionaires, and smart people invest in when they see economic chaos coming. So the only question left is: Are you protecting your future, or are you gambling it on a system that’s already failing?

Title: Costco and investors could pay big time for its DEI policies
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/costco-investors-could-pay-big-time-its-dei-policies
Time Published: 2025-02-14T10:00:45Z

Americans from Texas, Michigan and New York react to Costco's refusal to adhere to President Trump's private sector suggestion to band DEI hiring policies. By now, many companies have learned the hard way that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs aren’t the business panacea they were once sold to be. In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks. But Costco, against the tide, has doubled down on its DEI initiatives — at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing. Costco’s DEI program isn’t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company’s operations at every level, with a Chief Diversity Officer at the helm and employees dedicated solely to diversity goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired. Moreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting suppliers, and its donations go to controversial activist groups — some of which have been accused of illegal racial discrimination themselves. FORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE In a bid to halt Costco’s DEI trajectory, a shareholder proposal was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, the financial fallout for Costco could be catastrophic. While many companies move away from DEI, Costco continues to stick to its outmoded strategy. FILE: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024, in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) If even a small fraction of Costco’s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn’t retreat; instead, the company’s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn’t just about improving financial outcomes, but about "enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence." CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Despite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — were complicit with the board in driving Costco’s DEI push. With significant stakes in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco’s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal’s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer. Costco’s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies — such as Costco — that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination. On top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They argue that Costco’s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action. Costco’s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace hostility and fail to yield the promised business benefits should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco’s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price. The tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn’t pay off.

Title: ‘The tide is turning’: why more parents are delaying access to smartphones for children starting secondary school
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/02/14/the-tide-is-turning-why-more-parents-are-delaying-access-to-smartphones-for-children-starting-secondary-school/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T09:16:50Z

A few months ago Mary Lovegrove was at the gates of her son’s primary school talking to other parents about how they felt forced into giving their children smartphones once they moved on to second level. “Everyone was just resigned to it,” says Lovegrove, whose son (12) starts first year in September. “We were really dreading it, but felt we’d little choice because all their classmates would have one.” From Glasthule in Dublin, she decided to set up a WhatsApp group last November for parents of other children due to start at her son’s secondary school in the hope a handful of other like-minded parents might join. Within days 100 parents had signed up. As of this week, a total of 124 parents – about 75 per cent of the class’s parents – have joined the “delay smartphones and/or social media” group. The second-level school her son is due to attend is one of about a dozen, mostly in the South Dublin area, where similar parent-led WhatsApp groups have emerged in recent weeks. They include St Andrew’s College and Coláiste Íosagáin in Booterstown, Newpark Comprehensive School and Sion Hill College in Blackrock, Loreto Foxrock, Loreto Dalkey and others. There are early signs of others sprouting up among parents of soon-to-be first-year students in Cork, Galway and elsewhere. Parents are, in a way, conducting a large-scale social experiment: can they hold out in the face of their children’s self-proclaimed wants and needs, the might of social media’s addictive algorithms and what many see as a failure by successive governments to regulate the dangers of the online world. [ Can a school smartphone ban work? Here’s what principals and anti-bullying researchers thinkOpens in new window ] “Intuitively, we know that giving them a smartphone at that age is just too early,” Lovegrove says. “But I feel like the tide is turning. It’s about strength in numbers. If parents know their child won’t be the only one without a smartphone, it makes it much easier to delay.” Eoghan Cleary sees the impact of children’s unfettered internet access among his students on a daily basis. He is an assistant principal, English teacher and coordinator of SPHE (social, personal and health education) at Temple Carrig, a mixed secondary school in Greystones. In discussions with his students, he says it is clear they are being bombarded with an array of highly inappropriate and damaging content – with serious consequences. “As soon as the internet realises you’re a teenage boy or girl, you are flooded with stuff which their research shows will keep you scrolling,” he says. “For guys, it’s all the misogynistic content. All of the narratives that men are being falsely accused of rape; that if you don’t have a father you’re more likely to be a rapist, a criminal and a drug addict – all this comes up in the classroom,” he says. “And then for girls, they’re just bombarded with fake Ozempic nasal sprays, tanning injections, teeth filing, fake Botox supplements – all the stuff that’s based on their appearance and more so about their sexualisation.” The proliferation of pornography is everywhere online, he says, and across all social media platforms. “If you’re a female student, you get direct messages regularly asking for nude selfies. I had a first-year group ... who had a WhatsApp group which was primarily used for porn sharing.” The impact of all this, he says, is deeply troubling. Cleary has received disclosures of sexual assault from students who were at parties; evidence of students being blackmailed online after sharing sexual images of themselves; reports of self-harm in school bathrooms; worryingly high levels of anxiety and school refusal. Research shows mental health problems have soared since smartphones became ubiquitous well over a decade ago. There have been numerous warnings, too, of weakened social bonds, increased loneliness, sadness and social anxiety among children. [ McEntee to push ahead with €9m smartphone pouches as study casts doubt over their meritsOpens in new window ] While some large-scale studies are slow to solidify a causal relationship between social media usage and these problems, Cleary has no such reservations. “To me, it’s so bloody obvious that it’s smartphones ... but I’m also at pains to state that it isn’t really about smartphones alone; it’s giving the internet access to your child, through any device. It is not so much what your child does online; it’s what the online world does as soon as it realises who your child is ... this wasn’t so much of a problem before algorithms.” Hilda Hamilton is one of the parents signed up to the “delay smartphones” campaign. A mother of three from Sandymount in Dublin, she is determined to hold off getting a smartphone for her eldest son (12). “My gut feeling is there is something fundamentally wrong with giving a smartphone at that age,” she says. “I know how much I use it and I’m 44. It is so addictive – yet we’re expecting them to have the emotional intelligence to handle it.” She feels parents are being failed by government, regulators and social media companies, but is cheered by the fact that parents are taking action. Like many in the WhatsApp groups, she is thinking of giving her son an old-style Nokia or Balance phone, designed to block addictive content and apps, instead. “I’m pro technology and being able to communicate, but want to delay his access to social media ... It would purely be a means of contacting him. You can still have independence with a normal phone.” Gill Hurley from Dalkey has told her 12-year-old he will not be getting a phone. “Is he delighted? No, but he understands my view ... they don’t have to like it, but if they understand your reasons, I think they will get more on-board ... “I’m not naive and I know the pressure will be on when he starts second level ... but I also know that if I gave him a smartphone, I’d be arguing all the time about apps and screen time. So, this really is the lesser of the two evils.” For some parents involved in the initiative, it is a second chance to take a different path. Ross Staunton gave his daughter in second year a smartphone when she started second level on the basis that all her class would have one. Having seen the impact of it, he wants to delay doing the same for his son who starts secondary school in September. “The crunch time will come in the summer,” he admits. “We’re all talking a good game at the moment and most, I think, are planning to press ahead with it. Even if some do cave in, I’m hopeful there will be enough. It will require bravery from parents. I think if we can hold off until 14 or 15 years of age, you’re doing well.” Eoghan Cleary regularly gives talks to parents at schools about staying safe online. He has been doing it for about eight years but only recently felt a “tipping point” in the level of interest. “Back then there might have been 10 or 14 people in the room turning up. Now, the rooms are packed with hundreds of parents. Parents are more aware. They can see what’s going on with their children and don’t know what to do about it.” One of his key messages, he says, is that parents have power – even if they don’t realise it. “Otherwise, governments are not going to do anything. Yes, there’s a large corporate tech lobby out there. But as soon as the parents come together and say, ‘you need to protect our children online’, they will have to act.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 5 Low-cost Altcoins with Millionaire-Making Potential

Time Published: 2025-02-14T09:00:10Z

As the fabled altcoin season draws closer, investors have started positioning themselves for the expected growth. Even so, knowing which top crypto coin is primed for an extended rally among the thousands of altcoins available on the market is challenging. Based on expert research and analysis, this piece highlights five top altcoins under a $4 valuation that have the potential to trigger a parabolic surge in the coming weeks. These assets include XRP, Cardano, Tron, Sui, and the ChowWow (CHOW) meme project. Here’s why investing in these altcoins in February could yield significant ROIs for investors in 2025. The last quarter of 2024 was eventful for the XRP token, given the legal victory against the SEC and the token’s significant value growth in the market. Similarly, XRP seeks to consolidate its momentum in Q1 of 2025 and beyond. For context, market stats show that XRP’s price gained over 380% since the start of the last quarter, growing from $0.52 to a price peak of $3.4 in January. Prospectively, XRP is on the right path toward an extended bullish trajectory. That is because of the growing real-world adoption of the project, as evidenced by a partnership between XRP and Unicâmbio to facilitate cross-border transactions between Brazil and Portugal. Similarly, the pursuit of XRP ETF approval from multiple asset management firms like BlackRock, Grayscale, and recent Nasdaq ETF applications all point toward a bullish sentiment that the token harbors. With Bank of America using XRP for all their transactions, the market will likely witness parabolic growth for XRP in 2025. As such, XRP is one of the best altcoins to buy, and HODL for future gains. Despite seeing about an 18% decline within the last month, Cardano (ADA) is on a bullish trajectory. That is because the Cardano blockchain has undergone a revolutionary upgrade, and a possible collaboration with global tech leader Microsoft is on the horizon. For context, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson hinted at a possible collaboration between Cardano and Microsoft, a move that could trigger a chain of bullish uptrend. Also, following Cardano’s latest Plomin Hard Fork upgrade, the network is now fully decentralized, allowing stakeholders the power to vote on the native blockchain. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s filing for a Cardano ETF has elevated the bullish potential of the Cardano token to new heights. Given the heightened bullish sentiment of altcoin since the start of the year, the token is likely to set a new ATH in 2025. Market stats show that the Cardano price is still above the $0.70 support level. As such, a rise above $1 could push the ADA price to a new level. This makes it one of the top altcoins to invest in 2025. The Tron token has witnessed a significant uptrend in value with a 10% price growth within the past month, as per stats from CoinMarketCap. Having recorded an all-time price high of $0.44 on December 4th, the Tron crypto coin declined with the market-wide bearish trend of January. However, investors may gear up for another round of bullish momentum especially considering the positive market trends on the Tron Blockchain. For context, Cointelegraph reports that over $2.02 billion worth of stablecoins have been issued on the Tron network within the first week of February, only second to Ethereum ($2.43 billion). Notably, the Tron network has outpaced Ethereum in revenue inflow over the past months, signaling an increasing transaction volume. As the Tron network continues to see more volume, the value of the TRX token is expected to grow, pushing more market demand and higher growth potential. Although the Tron trading volume is down, the altcoin price is expected to rally when the market recovers. Overall, Tron is one of the top altcoins that is poised for significant growth in 2025. Undoubtedly, the Sui token is undergoing a major price retracement that has seen it lose about 23% in value within the past month as per market stats. However, the retracement could be an opportunity to buy the Sui coin before a likely bullish breakout. It should be noted that Sui’s price recorded an all-time price high of $5.35 on January 6th before the recent market correction. However, the increasing expansion of Sui in the market could trigger a rally for the top altcoin in no time. For context, traders can now buy the Sui token directly in the Phantom wallet. Also, the move to roll out internetless transactions on the Sui network via SMS is another game-changer that will boost the blockchain’s accessibility and volume, increasing Sui’s use case and value over time. While several altcoins have dipped in the past weeks, Sui’s price has maintained support above $3. Crypto analyst Momin, in a tweet on X, expects the Sui crypto price to surge once the market gains clarity, with a high possibility of retesting the $4 mark. Given Sui’s massive potential, the price might surpass $10 in 2025, making it one of the altcoins to watch in the year. Even while in presale, investors have recognized the exponential bullish trajectory of the ChowWow (CHOW) meme coin project. That is why thousands of investors have already purchased the ChowWow presale ahead of launch. With up to 260% ROI projection before launch, ChowWow harbors an even bigger growth potential post-launch. For context, ChowWow is a community-driven meme coin project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed. As such, the ChowWow project is a decentralized embodiment of the Chow dog that will provide strong community engagement, intuitive features, and the opportunity to generate fortune on the platform. ChowWow comes with elaborate utilities, such as the play-to-earn feature, which rewards players with gifts that can be converted to real-world value. The stake-to-earn feature is another use case where users can stake their $CHOW tokens and earn up to 8 – 15% in APY, which will be paid monthly. Other exciting community engagements include airdrops, social media campaigns, and competitions. Built on the Solana network, ChowWow will inherit the network’s low fees and faster transaction processing, ensuring that users have a seamless gaming experience. The native token CHOW is used for in-game purchases on the P2E platform. Outside that, it is a means of distributing rewards, cashback, and more. Like Shiba Inu, the CHOW token is deflationary with a buy-and-burn mechanism designed to stabilize the price. All these are likely to boost the price in the long term. Sold for just $0.008, now is the best time to accumulate the meme coin which is picked as the next 100x Solana coin. Visit ChowWow Presale All the top crypto assets reviewed in this piece harbor significant bullish potential and should be considered for investment. However, for investors with limited funds that can’t be invested in all the tokens highlighted, prioritizing the ChowWow presale is likely the best bet. That’s because ChowWow is still in its presale phase and hasn’t witnessed the massive rallies that come with a project launch or crypto exchange listing. Also, the low price entry advantage and high utility offering make ChowWow one of the best altcoins to invest in for investors looking for projects that can easily hit 10x in the coming weeks.

Title: The rumors about the reshuffle at M.M. (and what is true), Nikos, the Sorbonne and Google, the 9-million-euro café, the Sklavenitis-Panteliadis battle

Hello, so as expected, the videos submitted to the investigator regarding the Tempi accident do not show any undeclared cargo in the wagons. Today or tomorrow, the forensic report from the Hellenic Police laboratories regarding their authenticity will be released, and we move on. And I say “expected” because only a suicidal person would voluntarily submit fake videos in such a case. Now you might say, “Can public opinion be convinced that there is no cover-up, as 70%-80% of all polls indicate?” The answer is “no,” but just as people roughly understood that the government didn’t care much about the Tempi issue after the elections, now they will slowly begin to realize that the little system set up against it is not about delivering justice for Tempi. And, of course, part of that system is the trio “Androulakis-Velopoulos-Zoi,” along with the many others who have vested interests, exploiting pain and anger. Patience is needed to watch this whole play unfold. Reshuffle I asked my source about the reshuffle, and you might ask why I ask…on a permanent basis. Well, because when we enter a reshuffle period, it’s good to ask often, as the situation changes very quickly. My reliable source tells me that the reshuffle is set for March. There are no changes at the M.M., Pavlos Marinakis stays there, Kostis Hatzidakis is also not going to be vice president at M.M. (these rumors have been circulating lately), and if there is an addition, it will be the truly significant one of Gerapetritis, which, however, has not yet been decided by the Prime Minister. The Sorbonne at Maximos This afternoon, the officials from the Sorbonne University, who arrived in Athens yesterday evening, will be at Maximos Mansion to present Mitsotakis with their application for establishing the first Greek branch under the Pierrakakis law. Earlier, they will have gone to the Ministry of Education to submit the relevant application. At M.M., there will be the vice president of Sorbonne, Olivier Houdart, the dean of the School of Political and Social Studies, Anne Fossone, the president of the French College of Greece, Stelios Amargianakis, and the director of International Relations, Alexandros Despotopoulos. The five-year operational plan submitted for approval to the competent authorities includes €15 million in investments for a campus, €3 million for cutting-edge research, and over €7 million in scholarships. The plan initially includes three faculties: Law, Economics-Management, and Physical Education, with a prospect of increasing to six faculties within five years, including a School of Media and Communication. Google it, chief! Now, regarding the Sorbonne, we had another comedy episode yesterday with PASOK, especially with its leader Nikos, who mocked Pierrakakis, claiming that this so-called Sorbonne University coming here is fake. Pierrakakis didn’t do much in response, don’t think otherwise, he just wrote a reply telling him that with a simple Google search, Androulakis could find the public French university Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, which is one of the 13 institutions that succeeded the famous University of Paris and has 26,000 students and 1,200 professors. He also responded that this university’s planned investment in Greece is €15 million for a campus and another €10 million for research, scholarships, etc. So, I ask, as good-naturedly as I can, honestly, how hard is it, man, to pick up a phone and ask someone more specialized in education (PASOK had dozens) to give you the right perspective on such a simple issue? But no, Nikos is busy dealing with butchers… At M.M. for Attica’s garbage The government and the Prime Minister himself must immediately make crucial decisions regarding the role of the Unified Waste Management Association, which manages Attica’s waste. After two audit reports on the previous administration’s projects and actions, direct awards, and rodent control contracts, as well as the disciplinary referral for misconduct of five elected officials who participated in the EDSNA administration under Patoulis, the association’s file is being prioritized for evaluation. Reports indicate that a meeting is scheduled at Maximos Mansion today regarding the waste association and the bold decisions the government must make for the future and how it will operate. The agenda of the meeting is unknown, but sources suggest that Mitsotakis’ office has a plan to dissolve EDSNA and temporarily transfer its responsibilities to the president of PEDA (Regional Association of Municipalities of Attica) and mayor of Galatsi, Giorgos Markopoulos. The goal for the new entity is for the Region to have no involvement, with only the municipalities participating, while all major Public-Private Partnership (PPP) waste management projects for Attica will be centrally handled by the Ministry of Environment. What I genuinely don’t understand is, first, how it is possible to dissolve an organization like EDSNA, which is currently under the scrutiny of inspectors and prosecutors following reports of mismanagement? If nothing else, there is a serious ethical issue, and perhaps its dissolution could even be interpreted as a cover-up. And second, are municipalities really being called upon once again to solve Athens’ garbage problem after twenty years? And who guarantees us that there is less corruption there? Petralias’ Concern for Santorini If there is one person who these days has an additional concern about the situation in Santorini, as a competent source tells me, it is the Deputy Minister of Finance Thanos Petralias, who “holds” the treasury. Petralias knows well that last year Santorini accounted for 2.5% of GDP, as the season was booming, and the cruise industry also performed very well. In absolute numbers, Santorini contributed approximately 6 billion to GDP. An additional reason for concern is the stability of the island’s port. So, as you can understand, in the state treasury, they listen with great concern to the scenarios of an extended seismic sequence (and the emergency measures). Duel Between Sklavenitis-Panteliadis and Vardinogiannis’ Entry Competition in wholesale sales for professionals, companies, etc., is heating up. The Sklavenitis group, which owns the The Mart chain, has decided to strengthen its wholesale network to increase its market share, which places it in second place. Sklavenitis’ decision threatens Panteliadis, who has established himself in first place in the market with Metro Cash and Carry. The Mart currently has 14 stores, and the next move from Sklavenitis is expansion into the islands, as it currently has a presence only in Chania and Heraklion. In 2023, The Mart had a turnover of 432 million and net profits of 11 million. I should note that both Sklavenitis and Panteliadis are closely monitoring the move by G. Vardinogiannis to enter the small retail market by acquiring the Smart Shop chain through Motor Oil, which also has stores outside gas stations. Smart Shop does not directly affect the supermarket customer, but it can compete with convenience stores, grocery stores, etc., that are wholesale customers. After 9 Years and 9 Million (for a Bakery) And since we are on the topic of chains and their plans, let me tell you the final cost for Veneti-Jackson Hall on the Milioni pedestrian street in Kolonaki, which is the flagship store of the Veneti network. The store is now operating, and from the moment Veneti took over until it opened to the public, nine years had to pass. During this period, the initial budget of 2 million euros reached 9 million. As you can imagine, amortization is very difficult if not impossible. Capital Increase of 56 Million in Europe Holdings The capital increase being planned by Europe Holdings (the entity resulting from the merger of KLM–Intracom Properties) will be at the level of 56 million euros as part of the strategy that has as its next stage the already agreed acquisition of Europe Insurance for the creation of a business hub with a presence in insurance as well as real estate management. On 6/3, the extraordinary General Assembly for the capital increase is expected to take place, and if the timeline is followed, the process is expected to be completed by the end of April, so that the shareholder changes can then be finalized, through which Nikos Makropoulos, the current owner of the insurance company, will become a shareholder with 10.3% of the new entity, the second largest after Intracom Holdings. The entire venture for Europe Holdings will be completed before Easter. Komarek with McLaren Allwyn, the parent group of OPAP, has signed an agreement that ensures it global exposure to further strengthen its international development. In combination with the long-term partnership it is initiating with Formula 1, it has entered into an official collaboration with the McLaren team, the F1 Constructors’ Champion for 2024. This partnership has a clear goal of strengthening the group’s activities and brand worldwide, and as an official partner of McLaren Racing, the Allwyn logo will appear on the cars and the team’s driver suits. Karel Komarek, owner of Allwyn, has long-standing ties with the world of F1 and, together with David Coulthard—former world champion—has founded, funds, and supports the initiative “More Than Equal” with the goal of preparing for the emergence of the first female Formula 1 World Champion Driver. The Stoiximan boosts OPAP And since we are in a gambling environment, on the sidelines of yesterday’s Stoiximan event that brought the UEFA Europa League and Conference League trophies to Athens, the company’s executives emphasized the excellent performance recorded in the previous year’s financial figures. Stoiximan recorded double-digit growth, driven primarily by the sportsbook, which was strengthened by the major sporting events of the year, especially Euro 2024. This rise, as stated by the executives of the new management team led by Managing Director Nikos Fligos, was also accompanied by a significant increase in new customer registrations, forming a strong base for this year as well. These performances will naturally be reflected in the results of OPAP, which holds an 84.49% stake and maintains exclusive control of Stoiximan and its operations in Greece and Cyprus. OPAP will announce its 2024 financial results on March 19, followed by the annual shareholders’ meeting on March 29. Earlier, the dividend amount will be disclosed, which is eagerly anticipated by the market, as a pre-dividend of 0.60 euros has already been issued. The entrepreneurs aiming to become the country’s largest winemakers A new company has been established by the Georgiadis brothers of Sterner Stenhus, who—beyond their other investments—have set a goal to become the largest winemakers in the country. As is known, they have already incorporated the historic “Boutari” winery under their group’s umbrella (with Semeli joining just a few days ago). The new company, headed by George Rentià, Chief Financial Officer of Sterner Stenhus Greece, is titled “Scalarea Crete Single-Member S.A.” and is based in Fantaxometocho of the Skalani settlement. Its purpose ranges from wine production to holiday accommodations and many other activities, while its initial share capital is 200,000 euros, which “Boutari Wineries S.A.,” represented by Thomas Georgiadis, has undertaken to cover. However, behind this matter lies an interesting backstory. It concerns the Boutari estate in Crete, which includes 73 acres of vineyards, its most modern winery, and even a boutique hotel. The newest and most modernly designed “Boutari” winery was completed in early 2004 and is built outside the village of Skalani, on the Fantaxometocho estate, just 8 km from the center of Heraklion and 4 km from the archaeological site of Knossos. Fantaxometocho, the Georgiadis brothers, and the Logothetis family The Fantaxometocho estate, also known as the “Ghost Estate,” owes its name to the efforts of its first owner to protect it from pirate raids by spreading rumors that ghosts inhabited the property. Beyond the winery, however, a decade ago, through the Scalarea IKE company, founded in June 2014, a plan was initiated to create a small complex with three luxury rooms. Shortly after, a partnership was formed with Aria Hotels, a subsidiary of the Logothetis family (Libra Group), a well-known chain of boutique hotels and independent residences across numerous island and mainland destinations in Greece. At the time, it was stated that “in the spring of 2015, the Boutari winery, through its partnership with Aria Hotels, created the Scalani Hills Boutari Winery and Residences,” which includes three luxury residences named Kotsifali, Malvasia, and Liatiko, housed in the fully renovated old estate. In 2022, Scalarea IKE was renamed “Blue Rock Suites MIKE” and remains part of Aria Hotels. Now, whether the Georgiadis brothers’ new company intends to open another accommodation facility in addition to the winery at Fantaxometocho or take over the existing one, we will see in the coming period. Fais Group’s Prospectus to the Capital Market Commission in Early March Barring unforeseen circumstances, the submission of the Fais Group’s Prospectus is expected within the first ten days of March, aiming to raise 50-60 million euros and list its shares on the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. The management is anticipating a “pleasant surprise” from the 2024 results to complement the Prospectus. In 2023, revenue reached 191.3 million euros (up from 163.2 million euros in 2022), and net profits amounted to 4.7 million euros, up from 2.7 million euros. Sales for 2024 have already exceeded 200 million euros. The Group’s secret weapon lies in its wide range of activities, spanning from the distribution of sportswear and wellness equipment to luxury footwear and accessories, premium & lifestyle fashion products, cosmetics distribution, and, of course, commercial real estate development. The Stock Market Celebrated the “Peace Party” Since March 28, 2011 (during the government of George Papandreou), the General Index of the Athens Stock Exchange had not reached 1,600 points. Fully aligned yesterday with the “peace party” of major European markets, with an impressive increase in transaction value to 212.7 million euros (only 22.11 million in packages), the General Index abandoned its sideways upward movement of recent weeks and surged with a +2.49% increase to 1,600.97 points. The Athens Stock Exchange seems poised today to complete its eighth consecutive week of gains, while the total market capitalization has reached 112 billion euros. To be absolutely precise, the majority of yesterday’s rise in the General Index is undoubtedly due to the Coca Cola 3E stock, which reached a market capitalization of 14.3 billion euros, with an impressive +7.9% increase to 38.5 euros, driven by the excellent financial results announced in the morning and the promise of a 1.03 euros per share dividend, up 11% year-on-year. If half of the index’s rise is attributed to Coca Cola, half of the transaction value is owed to the banks. Piraeus stood out with a 3.9% rise to 4.66 euros, closely followed by National Bank (+3.61%) at 8.6 euros, Alpha Bank (+3.21%) at 1.847 euros, and Eurobank (+2.5%) at 2.46 euros. Not many expect interest rate cuts in the immediate future (which has implications for bank profits), and this sentiment was reflected in the bond market. The 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond yields 4.55%, the German Bond 2.41%, the French Bond 3.10%, and the Greek Bond follows closely at 3.25%. Metlen, which has been on a strong upward trend in recent days, closed at 35.96 euros (+1.87%) and, with a market capitalization nearing 5 billion euros, has secured its entry into the FTSE 100 index in London. TITAN halted its recent decline following TITAN America’s entry into Wall Street and rose +1.17% to close at 43.1 euros. Motor Oil is aiming for its 10th consecutive positive session today, having closed yesterday with a +1.56% increase at 22.2 euros. Not a single stock in the FTSE had a negative sign yesterday. The Largest Artificial Intelligence Data Center in Europe Europe is searching for its own champion in Artificial Intelligence, but developments in the field have come from the United Arab Emirates, which announced an investment of 30 to 50 billion euros for the creation of the largest AI data center in Europe. The project will be built in France and will be the heart of a new “AI campus,” with power reaching up to one gigawatt. This announcement was made during the meeting between French President Emmanuel Macron and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The French government had already identified 35 locations for the development of AI data centers, emphasizing the country’s strategic importance in the global AI race. The battle for Europe’s AI champion has already begun. The Whole World Is Buying Stocks on Wall Street In the past 12 months, non-U.S. investors have purchased 520 billion dollars’ worth of stocks on Wall Street. This means that foreign investors now control 59% of financial assets in the U.S., surpassing even the levels of the Dot-Com bubble in 2000. For comparison, in the past 12 months, net inflows into emerging markets totaled 220 billion euros, 57% less than the inflows into the U.S. market. Developed markets outside of Wall Street attracted only 20 billion dollars in investment capital inflows. Every day, the entire world is focused on New York. Especially in recent times, with Trump’s daily “surprises,” a massive buying spree has begun among hedge funds, which were net buyers of U.S. stocks for five consecutive days last week, at the fastest pace since November 2024. They selected eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, excluding only financial companies (banks, investment firms, etc.) and the real estate sector. The champion in attracting hedge fund capital was, unsurprisingly, the Information Technology sector. The Planet Is Adopting Cryptocurrencies 43% Faster Than Mobile Phones Cryptocurrencies have now surpassed 300 million users and dedicated followers in just 12 years. According to BlackRock, the planet is adopting cryptocurrencies 43% faster than mobile phones and 20% faster than the internet. Younger generations, inflation fears, and Trump’s pro-crypto stance are fueling the steady upward trend. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to reach 250 billion dollars. Every day, particularly in the U.S., the cryptocurrency market gains “institutional conquests” and popular acceptance. Explore related questions

Title: High Electric Bills Are the Tip of the Iceberg

U.S. electric rates are going up. In Missouri, Ameren increased residential power bills by 11% less than two years ago, and now it is seeking another 15% increase, per the Public Service Commission (PSC). According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), rate increases were experienced in 43 American states between 2023 and 2024. The EIA also reported record rate increases between 2021 and 2024 projections. In California, the Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) was granted six rate increases in 2024. Local ABC 30 Action News reported that The Utility Reform Network estimated that residents had experienced a $50 average increase to their bill before the last of these increases took effect. In New York City, Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) recently proposed an 11.4% rate increase for its electricity service, according to Energy and Environment News by Politico. An 8.79% electric rate increase was recently approved for We Energy (WE) in Wisconsin, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, which also serves Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, per Wisconsin Public Radio. All of these companies are publicly owned, and they are just a tiny fraction of the American electric companies working to appease their top shareholders: BlackRock and Vanguard. During the Jan. 15 public hearing to discuss Ameren Missouri’s proposed rate increase, Ameren Missouri vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs Warren Wood noted that the $446-million overall increase was proposed to offer a “fair return to shareholders.” According to Ameren’s Nasdaq listing, the company’s top shareholder is Vanguard Group Inc., a global hedge fund investment company focused on assessing “climate risk” and “net zero emissions.” BlackRock Inc. is Ameren’s third top shareholder, another global investment hedge fund focused on climate change. BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are also the top shareholders of Con Edison, PG&E, and the WEC Energy Group. American Electric Power is the parent company of various local electric companies that serve Americans living in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. According to the Nasdaq, this parent company’s top shareholders are Vanguard Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. as well. When cross-referencing every electric company that is a member of the Edison Electric Institute, one pattern is easily recognized: BlackRock and Vanguard are the top shareholders of the majority of American electric companies. And like their shareholders, these energy companies support the business of “clean energy.” Ameren, Con Edison, PG&E, WEC Energy, and American Electric Power have all committed to “clean energy” solutions, without offering a long-term plan on how these sources will be maintained for the future. “Clean Energy” waste has yet to be addressed by companies investing in “renewables.” It is a new concept even for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. On their website they note that “some end-of-life solar panels contain enough metals, like lead, to meet the definition of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.” The EPA website also notes the need to update standards for lithium-ion solar battery waste, because “though lithium batteries are generally safe when used, stored, and charged appropriately, these batteries can cause fires when improperly discarded or otherwise mismanaged at the end of their lives.” The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, estimated in 2022 that just 5% of lithium-ion batteries were recycled, adding yet another waste problem for “clean energy.” Add in ecosystem disruption and wildlife loss, and “clean energy” waste is growing into a big problem. Unfortunately, solar power especially has another dirty record: according to the Heritage Foundation, “Roughly 80% of solar components are manufactured in China using slave labor.” Even the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of International Labor Affairs states on its website, “Nearly half of the world’s polysilicon, a key material used to produce solar panels, comes from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR or Xinjiang), a region of China where members of ethnic and religious minority groups are forced by the government to work against their will.” What’s more, Congress held a hearing exploring China’s role in enslaving children and other people in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine cobalt, a key element in creating lithium-ion batteries. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) highlighted key points of the hearing: Around 70% of the world’s cobalt supply comes from the DRC, and 41% of all batteries containing cobalt are imported from the People’s Republic of China. CECC chairman Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) stated, “From dirt to battery, from cobalt to cars, the entire system is fueled by violence, cruelty, and corruption. ... By ignoring these rights and by treating people including children as expendable, China is committing gross violations of human rights and is seeking to rewrite the international order.” Journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos testified, “I have seen how landscapes have been destroyed, water polluted and air filled with dust and carbon as mining companies rush to extract minerals like copper, cobalt, lithium, and phosphates. Oftentimes, human rights abuses go hand in glove with these environmental catastrophes. ... We must also not forget the very real human rights abuses that attend the extraction of battery metals in the DRC. Children are brutalized, women are violated, and men are subject to wage slavery.” “Clean energy” investments and human rights violations surrounding Chinese industry are undeniable, and top American energy investors BlackRock and Vanguard are no strangers to China. In 2023, BlackRock and another global investment company, MSCI, were investigated by the House Select Committee on the CCP and found to have profited from “fueling China’s military.” The committee noted, “BlackRock and MSCI invest or enable the investment of Americans' savings into dozens of blacklisted Chinese companies that threaten US national security or support the Chinese Communist Party's human rights abuses.” Last year, the House Select Committee on the CCP reported that BlackRock had invested at least $1.9 billion in red-flagged and blacklisted companies that fund the military capabilities of the People’s Republic of China and aid its human rights violations. The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

The Coalition for a Prosperous America released a Case Study in 2023, which reported that Vanguard and another investment company, FTSE Russell, invested billions in the CCP. The report found that Vanguard specifically funded dozens of Chinese military subsidiaries and eight Chinese companies that had been blacklisted due to their violations of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). The top shareholders of publicly traded American energy companies have been linked to funding the nation’s largest adversary and its human rights violations. Meanwhile, Americans have been unknowingly footing the bill. But there is another way. Electric Co-Ops are being formed all over the nation. These give residents the power. Instead of publicly trading American energy to any globalist CCP-supporting hedge fund, co-ops are owned by the residents who pay into them. No globalist interference, no slave labor products. Right now, most of us have only a single electricity option, and these publicly traded monopolies are working against us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can form more energy co-ops and escape the technocratic globalists preying on publicly traded electric companies, and we can power our homes our way without compromising American values.

Title: Franklin Templeton’s money market fund launches on Solana – Is BlackRock losing ground?

With $1.6 trillion under management, why is Franklin Templeton doubling down on blockchain? Franklin Templeton has expanded its tokenized money market fund, Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), to the Solana [SOL] blockchain, further strengthening its presence in the digital asset space. With $1.6 trillion in assets under management, the firm announced this move on the 12th of February, building on FOBXX’s multi-chain strategy. Originally launched in 2021, the fund has already integrated with Ethereum [ETH], Coinbase’s Base, Aptos [APT], and Avalanche [AVAX], while Stellar [XLM] remains its primary blockchain. Thus, as the third-largest tokenized money market fund, FOBXX is nearing a total asset value of $600 million, highlighting its growing adoption. Additionally, it also holds the distinction of being the world’s first mutual fund to leverage blockchain technology for transaction processing and share ownership recording, with each share represented by a BENJI token. Remarking on the same, Franklin Templeton took to X (formerly Twitter) and said, “New chain unlocked. BENJI is now live on solana! Solana is a fast, secure and censorship resistant Layer 1 blockchain encouraging global adoption via its open infrastructure.” Needless to say, institutional interest in the Solana network has been on the rise, signaling a shift beyond its reputation as a hub for memecoins. In Q3 2024, investments in decentralized applications built on SOL surged by 54%, reaching $173 million, reflecting growing confidence among wealth managers and hedge funds. The token itself has staged a remarkable recovery from the bear market lows of under $10 following FTX’s collapse. It recently hit a 52-week high of $265.10, partly fueled by excitement surrounding former U.S. President Donald Trump’s memecoin launch on the network. Additionally, Solana has emerged as the dominant platform for launching new tokens, particularly within decentralized trading. A report from Pantera Capital revealed that SOL now accounts for over 90% of new tokens listed on decentralized exchanges—an extraordinary jump from just 1% at the end of 2023. Echoing similar sentiments, Cosmo Jiang and Eric Wallach in the same report noted, “Even when innovation doesn’t start on Solana, it eventually finds its way there.” However, as the firm strengthens its foothold, it faces growing competition from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has surged past Franklin’s BENJI token in market capitalization, reaching $637 million. With tokenized treasury products now totaling $3.6 billion, the race for dominance in this emerging sector is intensifying. Beyond its money market fund, Franklin Templeton has been actively expanding its crypto offerings, launching Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs while seeking SEC approval for a Crypto Index ETF. Its latest move—a Delaware-based trust linked to a Solana ETF—further highlights its strategic push into blockchain-based investment products. Therefore, as institutions embrace tokenized assets, Franklin Templeton’s innovation could help shape the future of digital finance.

Title: Green shoots for Vulcan? a2 Milk’s first dividend - Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Vulcan Steel sees green shoots emerging. Photo / NZME The reporting season gets under way in earnest next week, but results so far have given a glimpse as to what might lie ahead. Steel distributor Vulcan Steel is seen as a bellwether for the economy, and despite a first-half profit slump, the company’s share price has been on the up, post-result. Vulcan said Australia and New Zealand were at a turning point. It added trading volumes in New Zealand were anticipated to recover from the second or third quarter of this calendar year. Salt Funds managing director Matt Goodson said it’s not the first time Vulcan has cried “green shoots”. But going on the stronger share price, post result, it looked like the market believed it, he said. Goodson said the company’s exposure to the rural economy, particularly the strong dairy sector, made the “green shoots” story more credible. More light will be shed on the state of the economy next week when some of the market’s bigger companies report. “Everything we’ve seen sort of suggests the September quarter was the bottom. December was still a bit bumpy though,” Goodson said. “There are some signs of life, some not so good. Retail still looked a bit ugly in the December quarter. “It’s not so much the results themselves, but the strength and conviction around the forward statements.” Goodson said it would take until the second half of this year for the full impact of the Reserve Bank’s sharp rate cuts to take effect. “So that’s probably the single key thematic at the moment.” A2 Milk, which listed on the NZX back in 2004, is set to announce its first dividend at Monday’s first-half result. And with $968.9 million sitting in the bank (at last count) - why not? Last November, a2 Milk said its 2025 full-year revenue guidance was trading ahead of plan. Its previous guidance, issued in August, was for mid single-digit revenue growth in 2025 versus 2024. A2 Milk’s new dividend policy targets a payout ratio range of between 60% and 80% of normalised net profit. Aside from its dividend plans, a2 Milk has also raised the possibility of supply chain acquisitions or joint ventures to augment its Mataura Valley Milk facility in Southland. Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said he’s not expecting any surprises on Monday, relative to consensus expectations or the company’s own guidance. “This is a brave assertion to make given a2 Milk’s track record on result days, but the (still) pending supply chain acquisition/JV is the main area of possible surprise,” he said in a preview. He said the key focus areas were a2 Milk’s supply chain updates, China label infant formula revenue, and the English Label (EL) outlook in light of the new Genesis HMO product, a milk drink aimed at toddlers aged 1 year and over. The market consensus for Monday’s result is for half-year of revenue of $870.2m, up from $812.1m a year earlier, steady underlying Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at about $113.8m, up 2%, and a net profit of $77.7m, up 1%. The company’s first dividend is expected to be about 7c a share. For the big power generators, the second half of last year was fraught with challenges - a gas shortage, coupled with very low lake levels and light wind conditions - which saw wholesale prices go through the roof. This week, the big four power companies said they had teamed up to look at ways of extending the life of Genesis Energy’s coal and gas-fired Rankines at Huntly to improve security of supply. “I think it sort of really illustrates in New Zealand where it’s absolutely in the country’s interests that those turbines be refurbished and still be around come 2040,” Salt Funds' Goodson said. “Clearly, it’s going to need Commerce Commission authorisation to do so, so there is this really interesting tension between market efficiency and the best outcomes versus competition.” In terms of first-half results, Contact gets the ball rolling on Monday. At the end of this month, Mercury is expected to drop out of the influential MSCI Standard Index, to be supplanted by Contact. Big volumes of stock look likely to trade, courtesy of the influential passive funds, in the lead-up to the change. On the international scene, the big issue facing investors is what the US Federal Reserve does next after a surprisingly strong inflation outturn - 3% for the year to January - which drove US 10-year bond yields up by 10 basis points. The market had been pricing two more rate cuts this year from the Fed, but the data, which is yet to reflect the likely inflationary effect of new US tariffs, means people are beginning to question the likely track. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its official rate, which has been at 4.35% since November 2023, on Tuesday with the Reserve Bank of NZ expected to cut its Official Cash Rate by half a percent the following day. If the differential between New Zealand and US rates widens, still more downward pressure is expected to mount on the already weak Kiwi dollar, which should provide still more impetus for local exporters. Craigs Investment Partners has downgraded its recommendation in view of Auckland International Airport to “underweight”. “With the share price up 15% since our last note, we have downgraded our rating from neutral to underweight. “We think AIA now looks expensive and in the short-term we think news flow will provide more downside risk for sentiment,” Craigs said. AIA is due to report its interim result on February 20. Meanwhile, the giant international fund BlackRock has raised its stake in AIA to 9.19% from 8.17%. Insurance company Tower this week told shareholders at its annual meeting that its strong first quarter reflected year-on-year improvements in business-as-usual (BAU) claims and management expense ratios. The company had previously updated its earnings guidance on underlying net profit after tax (underlying Npat) for the year ending September 30, 2025. Tower’s full-year underlying net profit forecast was revised upwards to a range of between $60m and $70m, from the previously advised range of $50m to $60m. Forsyth Barr said it was a robust first-quarter trading update, which included further detail on favourable BAU claims performance and solid customer growth. “We see the latter as the key positive takeaway from the annual meeting update,” the broker said. Tower shares last traded at about $1.46, having gained 123% over the past 12 months. Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist, covering the financial markets and the primary sector.

Title: The Energy Transition Is Unstoppable—But Are We Moving Fast Enough?

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Tom Raftery works at the intersection of technology and sustainability. Tom researches and advises companies on the clean energy transition. Tom also keynotes international events, chairs panels... Energy. The lifeblood of civilisation. The force that propels economies, lights up megacities, keeps your phone buzzing at 2 AM. And yet, the entire system—the backbone of modern life—is cracking, shifting, warping into something entirely new. Fossil fuels, the undisputed rulers of the past century, are on their way out. But are they leaving fast enough? That’s the billion, no, trillion-dollar question. I just sat down with Jarand Rystad, Founder and CEO of Rystad Energy, a guy who doesn’t just observe the global energy chessboard—he helps define the moves. We ripped into the hard questions: Is the energy transition accelerating at a breakneck pace, or are we still stuck in second gear? Are policy missteps slowing progress? And crucially, do we have a chance in hell of outrunning climate catastrophe? Spoiler alert: The energy revolution is in full swing. But momentum alone won’t save us. The stakes? Higher than ever. Wildfires torching landscapes. Supercharged storms rewriting coastlines. Energy markets seesawing in chaos. The transition isn’t some academic exercise—it’s the fulcrum upon which our collective future teeters. Why This Shift Is Unstoppable Conventional wisdom says the energy transition is a political affair—governments pushing green policies, activists waving placards. Nice story, but wrong. Economics is the real kingmaker. And the numbers? Staggering. ✔️ Solar & Wind: The Price Tag Tells the Story – Forget subsidies. Forget government mandates. In 2024, renewables are just…cheaper. Solar costs have imploded, free-falling by 81% between 2009-2019 and it has continued to fall precipitously year on year since (thanks, BloombergNEF). Wind isn’t far behind. This isn’t a “green” decision anymore. It’s a financial one. ✔️ Batteries: The Gamechanger That’s Already Here – Ten years ago, the idea of storing renewable power for later use felt like sci-fi. Now? Lithium-ion battery costs have nosedived by over 90% between 2010-2023 (IRENA says hello). Grid-scale storage is no longer theoretical—it’s happening. ✔️ Fossil Fuel Investing? A Sinking Ship – Once a safe bet, now a financial minefield. Oil and gas markets swing wildly, spooking investors—some of whom are doubling down on renewables, while others hesitate amid shifting political tides. BlackRock, Vanguard, and Wall Street’s biggest players had been making decisive moves into clean energy, but with the new U.S. administration recalibrating policies, some are slowing their green pivot, waiting to see how regulations shake out. Jarand Rystad put it plainly: If climate change weren’t even a thing, the energy transition would still be happening. It’s simple—clean tech is cheaper, faster, smarter. But don’t pop the champagne yet. The road ahead? Riddled with potholes. Three Colossal Roadblocks (And Why They Matter) 1️⃣ China: Renewable Powerhouse or Coal Addict? China is a paradox wrapped in a contradiction. In 2024 alone, they threw 357 GW of renewables onto the grid—more than the entire historical solar & wind capacity of the U.S. (around 310 GW, for context). But—and here’s the kicker—they’re still greenlighting new coal plants. Why? Two words: Energy security. No country wants rolling blackouts. The problem isn’t building renewables; it’s making them reliable. Storage, grid flexibility, and high-voltage transmission lines are the missing pieces. And until those systems scale up, coal remains the crutch. 2️⃣ Hydrogen & Carbon Capture: Savior or Overhyped Distraction? 🔹 Hydrogen sounds sexy, but let’s be real—it’s not powering your house or your EV. It’s expensive, inefficient, and, outside of industries like steel or aviation, it’s a square peg in a round hole. Electrification beats hydrogen in most scenarios. Every. Single. Time. 🔹 Carbon capture? More theory than practice. Sure, we can trap CO₂ from cement plants, but direct air capture is still a financial nightmare. Betting on carbon capture to save fossil fuels? Like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a leaky, cracked, coffee cup. 3️⃣ AI & Data Centres: The Hidden Energy Guzzler AI is rewriting industries, sure. But it’s also rewriting the global energy demand curve. By 2030, data centres could devour 8% of global electricity. That’s terrifying. The solution? Smart AI (hello DeepSeek, or similar) that uses very little electricity itself, and optimises power use, grids running on renewables, and better hardware efficiency. Otherwise, AI’s rapid rise could backfire, slamming the brakes on emissions reductions elsewhere. So What Needs to Happen—Yesterday? ✔️ Fossil Fuel Subsidies Need to Die – Governments are still dumping $7 trillion (yes, with a ‘T’) into fossil fuel subsidies (IMF stats). Imagine if even half of that went to renewables, storage, and transmission? Game over for coal and oil. ✔️ Investment Needs to Go Supersonic – We hit $1.8 trillion in clean energy investment in 2023. Sounds great? Not even close. The IEA says we need $4 trillion per year by 2030. That means doubling down—fast. ✔️ Grid Infrastructure Needs a Revolution – Renewables don’t work like fossil fuels. They’re intermittent, decentralised, and demand a smarter grid. We need better transmission lines (and optimized use of those lines), AI-driven power distribution, and massive battery deployments. This isn’t an option—it’s a requirement. The Verdict? We’re Winning, But Not Fast Enough Solar and wind are smashing fossil fuels on cost. China’s renewable buildout is staggering. Investors are funneling capital into clean energy like never before. But time is the one thing we don’t have. The 1.5°C climate goal? Almost out of reach. Global emissions? Still stubbornly high. And policy chaos? Threatens to slow everything down. The next 10 years are make-or-break. The choices made right now will determine whether we head towards a livable future—or lock in climate chaos for generations. Want the full deep dive? Listen to my full conversation with Jarand Rystad. What’s your take? Are we sprinting fast enough—or still crawling towards the finish line? Drop your thoughts in the comments. This post was first published on TomRaftery.com. Photo credit Wayne S. Grazio on Flickr If we had a time machine and could ensure that this rate of acceleration for clean energy happened 10 years earlier than it did, we might be in prime position. But given a lot of the intertia we felt, I agree that we're still lagging unfortunately behind Absolutely agree—if we had accelerated at this pace a decade earlier, we'd be in a far stronger position today. Unfortunately, inertia, policy delays, and legacy investments slowed progress. The key now is to avoid repeating those mistakes and scale even faster. That said, momentum is finally on renewables' side—costs have plummeted, investment is surging, and even historically slow-moving sectors like heavy industry are making shifts. The challenge? Ensuring that policy, infrastructure, and financing move at the same speed as technology. Do you think the current pace is enough to close the gap, or are we still underestimating the scale of change needed?

Title: Will Corporate Purpose Go The Way Of DEI?

Time Published: 2025-02-13T15:55:40Z

A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose speaks ... [+] to the very reason a company exists. With diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives under fire, will corporate purpose be next? U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered DEI initiatives be eliminated from government agencies and programs at a time when companies such as Boeing, Harley-Davidson, Target, Tractor Supply, Meta and Walmart, to name a few, are reassessing their commitments and values. If many companies appeared to embrace DEI – often under pressure and without deep conviction – following the death of George Floyd in 2020, that is changing now as societal and political winds shift to the right. How will this anti-DEI wave impact corporate purpose? In the face of backlash against DEI, is purpose at risk? Are we witnessing a return to profit maximization as the sole goal of business? Abandoning purpose would be a mistake. A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose is complex and multifaceted. While many companies signed on to DEI policies and environmental initiatives as ways to "check the box" on purpose, it goes beyond these societal goals that are now so polarizing. Instead, purpose speaks to the very reason a company exists. Broadly, corporate purpose can be understood through two perspectives: an outside-in approach, which emphasizes responding to external societal and systemic challenges, and an inside-out approach, which focuses on how a company's internal values and member motivations shape its daily operations to serve customers. The outside-in approach positions corporate purpose as a tool to help address important global challenges such as climate change and social justice. But it can become coercive and thus politically charged. Since government policy is involved in these systemic challenges, private and political interests may come into play, creating potential for disagreement both within and outside organizations. A lesson from the current backlash is that in democratic societies, when the societal stakes for different purposes are high, it is important not to run too far ahead of the electorate and to engage instead in transparent deliberation with slow-moving dissenters. The inside-out approach views purpose as a powerful driver of passion and energy, aligning employees’ personal values with the organization’s overarching goals. For example, under Hubert Joly’s leadership, Best Buy’s purposeextended beyond selling products to improving customers’ lives through technology. A key advantage of the inside-out approach is its ability to foster unity, both within the organization and with external stakeholders, as it is freely chosen by all, and is less likely to spark disagreement. That unity and inspiration should in turn bring greater engagement and productivity. While an inside-out purpose for corporations has many advantages in driving engagement and internal cohesion, it is not easy to draw all the motivational strength from it so that it can be sustainable in an organization that expects also business results. That requires not only defining a purpose thoughtfully but also internalizing and implementing it effectively. Only in this way there is a chance of creating win-wins for shareholders and other stakeholders. Here’s how to begin: Corporate purpose may be understood through two approaches: outside-in and inside-out. It may be useful for business leaders to look at models of purpose-driven organizations, companies that are financially successful but that counteract the pressure of profit maximization as the default objective of the firm. In implementing purpose, head, heart and hands must be involved. ISS, a facility support services company, defines its purpose as “connecting people and places to make the world work better.” By framing their purpose as an enabler of better work and life experiences for people, ISS ensures it is both inspiring and strategically aligned with their business objectives, serving as a guiding principle for decision-making. Definining the purpose is the head part of purpose. ISS also engages the heart by fostering an emotional connection to the purpose; by, for example, creating a culture of appreciation, recognition and community through its "Thank You Way" initiative, in which managers and clients send periodic tokens of gratitude to employees. ISS also trains employees to view their roles as opportunities to create positive experiences for clients and end users, ensuring that their purpose is reflected in every task, from cleaning offices to managing facilities. By making purpose actionable - hands - ISS demonstrates that it isn’t just an abstract ideal but a practical framework guiding how they work every day. Three years ago BlackRock chairman and chief executive Larry Fink advised CEOs: “It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose.” Although Fink himself has weathered bruising criticism of his views on sustainable investing and stakeholder capitalism – while delivering record results for the asset manager – his words on corporate purpose still ring true.

According to the White House, Russia’s Vladimir Putin has agreed to meet with President Trump to negotiate ending the war in Ukraine. Trump opposed the United States’ financial involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war during his campaign, distinguishing himself from the Biden administration’s funding of Ukraine’s military. Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke with years of U.S. foreign policy precedent in a recent statement asserting that Ukraine would not join NATO, a key provision for Putin. Trump has also been pushing for U.S. access to Ukraine’s mineral resources in any potential deal. We speak to The Nation’s Katrina vanden Heuvel about these latest developments. “There is an importance of what [Trump] is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war” that is “impoverishing Ukraine,” she says. “Both countries are war-weary” three years after the Russian invasion. NERMEEN SHAIKH: We begin today’s show with Russia and Ukraine. On Wednesday, President Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 90 minutes about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said they agreed to meet soon and immediately to begin negotiations to end the war. Trump then held a separate call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the swearing-in ceremony for the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I’ll be dealing with President Putin, largely on the phone, and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he’ll come here and I’ll go there, and we’re going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time. We’ll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. It’s a really bloody, horrible war. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump also addressed questions from reporters about whether Ukraine was being sidelined. REPORTER 1: Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this process a bit? Isn’t there a danger of that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don’t think so, as long as he’s there, but, you know, at some point you’re going to have to have elections, too. You’re going to have to have an election. REPORTER 2: Putin says he wants security assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In terms of what? REPORTER 2: If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll see what that means. We have — I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, he wants — if it ends, he wants it to end. And that’s President Putin said that. He wants it to end. He doesn’t want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. We talked about the possibility — I mentioned it — of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. And I think we’ll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future. REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of the peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it. What? REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of this peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Umm, it’s an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump’s phone call with Putin came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke at a NATO meeting in Brussels, where he said a return to Ukraine’s prewar borders is, quote, “unrealistic.” Hegseth also ruled out Ukraine’s future membership in NATO. DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH: As the war approaches its third anniversary, our message is clear: The bloodshed must stop, and this war must end. … We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. … That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission. … To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Germany and other European nations have rejected any peace talks with Moscow that do not include Kyiv. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has traveled to Kyiv to discuss a Trump proposal for Ukraine to give the U.S. access to its natural resources in exchange for continued U.S. military assistance. According to the State Department, Trump’s envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days to, quote, “engage with allies and partners across Europe who are willing to work with the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” unquote. For more, we’re joined by Katrina vanden Heuvel, Russia expert and publisher of The Nation magazine. Massive developments in this last 24 hours, Katrina. Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine? And can you talk about the significance of Trump’s call, 90 minutes, with President Putin, his first, at least we know publicly, with him since he became president? Also spoke with Zelensky and says his first talks will be Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: This is a monumental shift, Amy, for the — let’s begin with the fact that Russia launched this war of aggression. But from there on, this is a monumental shift, that, for example, the U.S. is not going to back Ukraine going into NATO. I think the defense secretary saying that has laid down a line that is in opposition to what we’ve seen for the last several — 17 years. That’s huge. I think the fact that the sides are talking is critical, because for too long it’s been a militarized relationship. It’s all been about Zelensky’s weapons and then the Russian weapons. Both countries are war-weary. The soldiers are demoralized. You’re entering a period of mud in coming out of the winter. I do think the key will be the security apparatus or the security framework that will be discussed. The Europeans — Macron the other day called for 150,000 security forces or peacekeeping forces. That seems very unrealistic. I think a lot will depend on what kind of security architecture emerges to keep Ukraine sovereign, free. There are elections that will be held, and that is mandated by the Ukrainian Constitution. And Zelensky has declared martial law. But in the end, what we’re witnessing is — and, listen, I mean, Trump — I don’t need to tell you how I feel about Trump, how The Nation feels about Trump, but there is an importance in what he is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war, to move toward ceasefire. And I think that is to be welcomed, because the war is impoverishing Ukraine. The question also will be, with a country, Ukraine, that has some of the vast reserves of titanium and uranium, how those will be allocated to reconstruct a ravaged country, Ukraine, what role Russia will play. There are many, many questions. But the important thing is to get to a table — round, square, oval — and to begin to discuss, talk, talk, talk, jaw, jaw, jaw. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Katrina, if you could say — you know, these comments that Hegseth made and that Trump has reiterated, namely that — as you mentioned, that NATO membership for Ukraine is ruled out, also that a return to pre-2014 borders is not realistic — so, insofar as what we know of Ukraine’s demands, is there any likelihood within the negotiations, given what’s already been said, that concessions can be made? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Yeah, I mean, I think the membership in the EU, which triggered this crisis in 2014, could be put back on the table. That’s one element. I do think that the reconstruction, the role Russia may play in helping fund reconstruction, is something important. I do think that Crimea and elements of the Donbas region may be put sort of de jure free, but possibly also negotiated into. That’s very tricky, the border there, the contact line. We may see a kind of armistice situation that we saw after the Korean War, so it’s left there. The trick is not to leave situations on the ground that can trigger, retrigger conflict. The NATO issue, I think, is critical, because I don’t know if people know, but it is basically a military-industrial complex lobbying operation. Members of NATO have to buy U.S. weapons. There’s an interoperability clause. In the same way, these security conferences that Hegseth is at or was going to, these are military-industrial complex lobbying parties. So, again, I come back to the fact, as much as can be demilitarized in the future regarding the security architecture of Ukraine will be helpful and important for the future of the region. I know there’s a narrative that, if let alone, Russia will go into the Baltics, will ravage Europe. Russia could barely beat Ukraine, a small country. It’s an anguish and horrible to watch what’s happened, launched by Russia. We’re three years on the anniversary. But the ability to talk and find a resolution, I think, can mitigate some of the fears of countries, which really have played a role in the debate to the exclusion of those who argue that Russia is not an expansionist power. I know that will lead many to shriek, but it can barely take on Ukraine. It can’t pay the pensions of thousands of people in other countries. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, absolutely, Katrina, but how, then, would you imagine that Russia could play a role somehow in the reconstruction of Ukraine, given its circumstances? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, there is a term that we’ve all learned in the last weeks: “oligarchs.” I mean, you know, there’s a lot of money in Russia that could be used. But the extractive foreign policy of Donald Trump is well suited for this moment, because, again, the minerals, which Mr. Zelensky has offered as part of a reconstruction effort. They’ve already had — Penny Pritzker was the reconstruction czar — Governor Pritzker’s sister — and she brought in Blackstone, BlackRock, our oligarchs, to help fund the reconstruction. The World Bank estimates it’s going to be at least a trillion. And we know what happens when countries walk away. We’ve walked away from Afghanistan. We walked away from other countries. So, I think there’s a moral and political and security need to find resources for reconstruction. AMY GOODMAN: Can you comment on the prisoner exchange, the teacher, Fogel, American teacher, after three-and-a-half years in prison in Russia, being returned in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a cryptocurrency guy who was convicted? He’s going back to Russia. And then you’ve got Belarus involved with three prisoners released, one of them American, one of them working for an American media outlet, and also the sort of passing references to Saudi Arabia being involved with that, not to mention it being the place where Trump will meet with Putin for the first part of the negotiation with — over the ending of the war in Ukraine, though European countries are saying they wouldn’t negotiate unless Ukraine was involved from the beginning. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: So, the first question, Amy, this is classic Cold War tit for tat. It’s like the film, Bridge of Spies. I mean, exchange of prisoners has been a longtime scenario. We’ve seen it. And, you know, what also happens, seriously, is obviously the repression of journalists, the arrest of journalists, the foreign agent. All of this — war is not good for progressive, dissenting people. I mean, it used to be said you went on — you became a dissident when you went on pension, but I think the dissenting community of Russia has been suppressed, not simply by the war, but by Putin’s politics. Saudi Arabia — I gasped when I heard that they might meet in Saudi Arabia, the home of the oligarchical vision. I suspect they’ll do Moscow-Washington in the end. But, you know, it reminds of how this war could have been averted. It could have been ended in March, April 2022, when there were substantive discussions in Istanbul. And there has been denial, but there’s also been acknowledgment that Victoria Nuland, who was in the State Department — the State Department — and Boris Johnson, who’s Boris Johnson, came in and upended it, sabotaged the possibility back then. So they should take that to their grave. AMY GOODMAN: Katrina vanden Heuvel, we thank you so much for being with us, publisher of The Nation magazine. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Thank you. AMY GOODMAN: Next up, “Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up.” We’ll speak with three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Eric Lipton about the billions Musk has to gain as he fires thousands and slashes the federal budget. Back in 30 seconds.

Title: Tokenization Platform Midas Introduces Yield-Bearing Tokens Linked to DeFi Funds

Midas, a protocol for issuing yield-bearing tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries and other assets, has introduced Liquid Yield Tokens (LYT) linked to actively managed, decentralized finance (DeFi) funds, starting out with Edge Capital, RE7 Capital, and MEV Capital. Late last year, Midas received regulatory approval to issue its basis trade and U.S. Treasuries tokens in Liechtenstein, allowing passporting across Germany and Europe. Tokenization builders in the crypto native and DeFi-focused arena saw the need for yield-bearing alternatives to established stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, which keep the interest generated from reserves. Additions to the Midas product suite reflect changing market conditions. For instance, the firm’s tokenized T-Bill product, based on a BlackRock money-market fund, was introduced when interest rates were around 5% and DeFi markets were much lower, at around 2%. The later addition of a cash and carry trade token delivered yields last year of over 20%, however market trends are reversing, said Midas CEO Dennis Dinkelmeyer. The new LYT product aims at yields as high as 20%, he said. “We've partnered up with the best in the industry such as Edge Capital, RE7 Capital and MEV Capital with more great names coming soon,” Dinkelmeyer said in an interview. “These fund managers are really experts when it comes to yield, whether with T-Bills, basis trades, or other yield sources like market making and arbitrage.” The Midas tokenization platform allows a wide audience exposure to these tokens with a one-click issue and redeem process, Dinkelmeyer said. “In addition, the tokens can be used as collateral in DeFi, starting with Euler and Morpho with more to follow.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and ethereum ... [+] exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as the bitcoin price surges. Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst.

"This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Unlike traditional financial advisors, robo-advisors offer low-cost investment management with minimal fees, making them attractive to a broader audience. Their integration with digital platforms allows users to access automated financial planning anytime, enhancing convenience. AI-powered algorithms provide personalized investment strategies based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market trends. Additionally, low entry barriers enable small investors to participate, further expanding the market. The growing demand for seamless, data-driven, and automated financial solutions continues to propel the adoption of robo-advisory services globally. Restraints: Limited Scope of Advice: The robo-advisory market faces several restraints despite its growing popularity. Limited scope of advice remains a major challenge, as most robo-advisors primarily focus on basic investment strategies like asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. They often lack capabilities for complex financial planning, including estate management, tax optimization, and tailored retirement strategies. Additionally, regulatory challenges, data security concerns, and the need for human financial expertise further hinder adoption. Many investors, especially high-net-worth individuals, prefer hybrid models that combine automation with human advisors. Opportunity: Growing Demand for Digital Solutions: The robo-advisory sector offers a large opportunity as digital uptake in financial services speeds up. As the demand for affordable, automated investment options rises, robo-advisors provide tailored portfolio management while requiring little human involvement. The emergence of AI, big data, and machine learning improves their capacity to deliver real-time insights and manage risks. Younger investors, particularly millennials and Gen Z, favor digital-first financial options, fueling market growth. Moreover, the rising awareness of financial planning, along with reduced fees relative to conventional advisors, makes robo-advisory services appealing. "Research made simple and affordable – Trusted Research Tailored just for you – IMR Knowledge Cluster" https://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/ Challenge: Competition and Profitability: The robo-advisory sector experiences significant rivalry due to the influx of traditional financial entities and fintech newcomers. Companies need to distinguish their products to draw in and keep customers, which frequently results in reduced fees that compress profit margins. Elevated customer acquisition expenses additionally hinder profitability, since building trust in automated financial guidance requires time. Moreover, adhering to regulations introduces challenges and costs, especially with changing financial legislation. Maintaining technology and fostering ongoing innovation demand considerable investment, underscoring the importance of scalability. Key Players to Watch: Recent Development In January 2025, Futu Holdings Limited, a leader in digital brokerage and wealth management, launched ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services in collaboration with BlackRock. Introduced in Hong Kong and Singapore in September 2024, this service aimed to optimize investment solutions for clients. Partnering with BlackRock, Futu provided five flagship Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios, leveraging iShares ETFs for diversified global exposure. In December 2024, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) acquired Japanese robo-advisory firm WealthNavi for approximately JPY 99.7 billion ($664 million). Founded in 2015, WealthNavi provided an automated asset management platform, handling over JPY 1.3 trillion. Its services included portfolio management, tax optimization, and rebalancing. In February, MUFG secured a 15% stake before launching a tender offer at JPY 1,950 per share, an 84% premium, to make WealthNavi a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Title: America's biggest companies are waging a stealth campaign to dismantle DEI

Time Published: 2025-02-13T09:17:01Z

How companies from Pepsi to Disney are quietly dismantling their diversity initiatives In 2020, it was all the rage for corporations to pledge their allegiance to diversity and inclusion. In 2025, it's very much in vogue to declare that they're no longer into that kind of stuff. Companies such as Target, Walmart, McDonald's, Google, and Meta have recently announced major rollbacks of their DEI efforts. In corporate America, nixing employee resource groups is the new version of posting that Black Lives Matter black square five years ago. On the flip side, companies including JPMorgan and Costco say they're sticking to their DEI guns despite the Trump-fueled headwinds. It's tempting to paint an us-versus-them — or them-versus-them — picture: the DEI backpedalers versus the DEI warriors. But there's a quieter and potentially larger group of businesses taking a different course: subtly burying DEI efforts. They're not putting out press releases or big memos saying they're axing programs aimed at hiring diverse candidates or tracking supplier demographics. Instead, they've taken a look at the legal, political, and cultural landscape and made the calculation that it's better to silently pull back on DEI-related language for now. "Many companies in America have always wanted to promote diversity in the workplace in a manner that's lawful, and that hasn't changed," said Rebecca Baker, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins in its labor and employment group. "What has changed is there's a cloud of ambiguity as to what is lawful." Companies are hoping to fly under the anti-DEI crowd's radar at a moment when the movement feels more emboldened than ever. They're afraid to put a target on their backs, legal or otherwise. Despite some of the attention-grabbing headlines, this might be how DEI really dies — quietly, in the shadows. While several companies have made splashy announcements about their DEI plans, others have simply scrubbed mentions of them, including in their annual 10-K financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For their latest filings, it appears that a lot of publicly traded companies did a CTRL+F+DELETE on "diversity." Legally, companies have to disclose some information about their workforces in their annual reports, such as how many people work for them, but they're not required to say anything about diversity and demographics. It had become popular over the past decade or so for companies to make such disclosures anyway, especially in the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020. But that's shifted as companies have become increasingly worried about being viewed as "woke" or overly progressive. General Motors, for example, cut the DEI section of its annual report. In its 2023 report, the automaker said it aimed to be "the most inclusive company in the world" and touted its diverse board of directors and dozen employee resource groups. In its 2024 report, that section was gone. PepsiCo's latest filing scrapped a breakdown of its workforce demographics as well as a line about how it believed its "culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation." The soda maker did, however, retain a mention of pay equity. Disney shortened its DEI section, in part removing mentions of employee development programs and fellowships for underrepresented talent while adding a mention of Heroes Work Here, an initiative to hire and train US military veterans. Mondelez International scrapped its section dedicated to diversity and inclusion in its workforce. Philip Morris International significantly shortened what had previously been its DEI section, removing goals for gender and racial representation in its management and mention of employee resource groups. The section is now named "collaborative culture." Some firms are taking a subtler approach. Pinterest, for example, renamed the "inclusion and diversity" section of its report "inclusion and belonging." Chipotle swapped "diversity, equity & inclusion" for "culture and inclusivity," though it continues to include breakdowns of its workforce by gender, ethnicity, and race. The companies mentioned did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record, with the exception of Philip Morris, which said it valued its "global workforce" and was "focused on fostering a fair and collaborative workplace in an environment that provides opportunities to all employees for growth and professional development." "Prior to Trump taking office, there was already a lot of pressure on DEI," said Andrew Jones, a senior researcher at the Conference Board's ESG Center. "Lots of companies obviously realize that DEI became a very politically loaded term, controversial term, even a slightly toxic term in terms of the legal and political scrutiny." Last spring, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that dozens of companies were changing their DEI descriptions in their annual reports amid heightened legal and political scrutiny. A new analysis by NPR this year found that several companies were axing references to DEI altogether. Beyond the filings, data provided by AlphaSense, a financial information and insights company, indicates that mentions of DEI have sharply declined on earnings calls and in other public investor-related communications over the past couple of years. Businesses are increasingly hush-hush about anything that might even have a whiff of DEI, lest they poke the anti-woke bear and become the next Bud Light or worse. "If you're a CEO, you've got the general counsel in one ear saying you're going to get sued or you're going to use lose contracts," said Alison Taylor, an associate professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who wrote the book "Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World." "And then you've got the public-affairs person in the other ear saying here's who's yelling at you on social media." Baker said companies were increasingly including mentions in their risk-factor disclosures of potential controversies around their employment practices and social initiatives. "So they're flagging that 'Hey, investors should understand that the DEI climate is in flux right now and we can't exactly predict what might happen. And some of our employment practices, although we believe they're fully legally compliant, may ultimately end up a target of litigation,'" she said. Corporate America was nervous before the election about the political tides turning, given the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and the growing influence of conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck. Now, Trump 2.0 has sent many of them into a silent panic mode. The president positioned himself as a fierce opponent of almost DEI, determined to root it out of the federal government and, if he can manage it, private industry. The crusade is clearly having a chilling effect across the business community. In an executive order signed on his first day in office, Trump set out to end what he called "radical and wasteful" DEI programs in the federal government. The next day, in a separate executive order, he revoked an order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that barred government contractors and subcontractors from engaging in employment discrimination. Many government contractors are public companies. But even for those that aren't, the order lays out steps for "encouraging the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences." It instructs federal agencies to identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private companies. In effect, they're hunting for lists of names to sue, and no one wants to be one of them. "There is a valid fear of companies having a target on their back based on how they outwardly promote DE&I," said Renai Rodney, a counsel in Ropes & Gray's litigation and enforcement practice group, "which is unfortunate, because while there's certain things in the executive order that companies should certainly be mindful of, the underlying law has not changed." The chaos and confusion is part of the point. The letter of the law isn't any different — it's always been illegal for companies to implement quotas or require a certain proportion of their workforce to be a specific race or gender. The law's interpretation and enforcement, however, have clearly undergone a reversal. Federal contractors run the risk of the Department of Justice going after them to assert that their DEI policies violated the False Claims Act, which prohibits contractors from defrauding the federal government. Major companies could be accused by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The law was meant to prevent businesses from declining to hire someone because they're part of a minority group; now it's being used against businesses by people who say they're being overlooked because they're in the majority. Jenny Yang, who served as an EEOC chair and commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and now heads the Urban Institute's Workplace Equity Initiative, said companies facing claims that they discriminated or used ill-defined "illegal DEI" practices may very well have a good case in court and win. But going to court costs money, and any battle is likely to draw attention, so they may be inclined to give up before there's even a fight. "A lot of this really does not have the law behind it, and it's not likely to survive a motion to dismiss," she said. "But companies don't want to spend the money even defending against the lawsuit, and they don't want the reputational harm, or they don't want their board to get upset." Employers may proactively examine programs they think could be subject to legal scrutiny, such as scholarships or fellowships aimed at underrepresented communities. "It may not actually make it to a legal decision, but they decide, well, we'll settle this by opening up that program to everyone and not just groups," Rodney said. "Those haven't been ruled unlawful, but companies are either deciding we don't want a bad decision on the books or we don't want to use resources to fight this, so we'll just change the terms of the program." It isn't just the federal government that companies have to worry about — conservative state authorities, legal groups, and individuals with big platforms are also freaking them out. In mid-2024, Missouri's attorney general sued IBM, alleging that it was using unlawful racial and gender quotas in employment. The Trump-aligned group America First Legal has filed several complaints, including against Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, over their DEI practices. Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, has told financial institutions such as BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup to watch it on DEI or face enforcement actions. A police pension fund in Florida is suing Target, saying it wasn't made aware of the risks of the retailer's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. "In terms of what's the actual legal risk, I think we're seeing it now morph into Title VII discrimination claims from individual employees, activism by Republican state attorneys general," Baker said. "Now we're waiting to see exactly what comes out of the president's executive order." Just because companies quietly disappear mentions of their DEI policies doesn't mean the work can't continue. They can practice without preaching, and many will. If one is to believe companies meant it when they said they cared about fostering diverse workplaces, then presumably none of that went away overnight. The issue is that, cynically, it's sometimes hard to believe these companies were that dedicated to the idea in the first place. "Many initiatives weren't always measurable," Jones said. "There were a lot of public commitments without really thinking through how they were measured and implemented." Corporate values often seem like a PR stunt — X supports the troops, Y wants to end racism — based on where companies calculate the "right" answer is at any given moment. What's "right" often means "whatever will generate the most cash for shareholders" or, increasingly, "what will keep us out of trouble." "They're governed by social media," Taylor said. "They're governed by who was last yelling at them." A few years ago, companies were worried about the progressive backlash. Now they're worried about the conservative one. To some extent, companies ended up in this spot by talking a big game and launching programs without thinking through what they were actually trying to accomplish. "They're making decisions out of fear, likely, but they know no matter what they do, there's going to be a percentage of the population that is upset with that decision," said Naomi Wheeless, the chief customer officer at Nextech Systems and a board member at Eventbrite. "So moving silently or slowly is the strategy that a lot of them are choosing." The strategy is not a foolproof one. Many activists and government officials are out for blood, and they're seeking to make some high-profile examples of big-name companies in order to put some anxiety in everyone else. Hiding doesn't mean you won't be found. What's more, the political winds can change, and if they do, companies may be faced with explaining their choices to a new set of constituents. Maybe next time they'll think about what they actually want to accomplish, business-wise, instead of just paying lip service to whoever's maddest at them on Twitter.

Title: Is Ethereum Undervalued? A Close Look at Realized Price and Institutional Activity

Time Published: 2025-02-13T06:00:55Z

Ethereum price action amid the broader crypto market bearish sentiment over recent weeks hasn’t been any different from the performance recorded in the past months. Over this period, Ethereum’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, remaining in a prolonged consolidation phase. Amid this, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D has shed light on Ethereum’s current state and factors that may influence its future price trajectory. The analysis notes that Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” narrative—an idea tied to its post-Merge deflationary tokenomics—has faced challenges. Total supply has reached record highs, and the staking ratio has decreased by 1% since November. However, despite these supply-side hurdles, several demand-side factors suggest Ethereum might be positioned for long-term growth. One other key insight from the analysis is that Ethereum appears undervalued based on its realized price. The realized price reflects the average acquisition cost of ETH holdings across all wallets, currently sitting at approximately $2,200. With the current market price around $2,600, the analyst calculates a market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio slightly above 1, indicating that ETH remains undervalued relative to historical norms. This level could act as a strong support base, potentially limiting further downside. Another factor supporting Ethereum’s potential upside is the behavior of long-term holders. The analysis highlights an increasing number of addresses that accumulate Ethereum without selling, akin to Bitcoin’s “permanent holders.” Although some larger investors have sold during recent downturns, their positions have been absorbed by these long-term holders, helping stabilize the market. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s investor base is maturing, with a growing segment committed to holding the asset through market volatility. Furthermore, the analyst points out that selling pressure in the futures market has eased. Data shows a notable reduction in market price trading volume on the sell side since Ethereum’s price near $4,000 in November last year. This decline in selling activity, even as prices fell, signals a relative influx of buying power, which could set the stage for a recovery if market conditions improve. Institutional participation is another encouraging factor. Major players, including BlackRock, Cumberland, and other prominent firms, have reportedly accumulated substantial amounts of ETH during the recent downturn. For example, BlackRock is said to have purchased over 100,000 ETH, valued at more than $270 million. Such significant institutional inflows not only boost demand but also lend credibility to Ethereum’s long-term investment thesis. Despite these positive indicators, the analysis acknowledges lingering challenges. The increase in total supply and the slight dip in the staking ratio could weigh on sentiment, particularly if macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. Moreover, Ethereum’s price movement may remain constrained in the short term as the broader market digests ongoing economic shifts. However, the combination of undervaluation, strong long-term holder participation, reduced selling pressure, and institutional accumulation paints a more optimistic medium- to long-term outlook. While Ethereum may continue to trade sideways in the near term, the factors outlined in the analysis suggest that it could be well-positioned for growth once broader market conditions stabilize.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.
