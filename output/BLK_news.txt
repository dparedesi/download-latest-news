Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Reports from CryptoQuant suggest that large holders are moving aggressively while smaller players are bailing out. Over the past week, wallets linked to key Bitcoin participants grabbed more than 16,000 BTC during a price decline. At the same time, retail investors have been selling into weakness, taking losses and widening the gap between whales and small traders. Analysts see this as a possible clue that the market could be forming a local bottom. The timing of these moves adds more complexity. September is rarely kind to markets. Data over the last 35 years shows the S&P 500 slipping an average of 1% during this month, and Bitcoin has often mirrored that seasonal drag. Now, throw in a Federal Reserve meeting on September 15-16, where traders assign an 80% chance to a 0.25% rate cut, and you have a cocktail of uncertainty. For some, a cut signals potential relief for risk assets. For others, the historic pattern overshadows any short-term optimism. Either way, volatility seems unavoidable. Amid this macro backdrop, a single transaction set off alarms. BlackRock shifted over 10,584 BTC—valued close to $1.20 billion—to Coinbase in one day. That kind of move rarely goes unnoticed. Transfers to exchanges often imply a readiness to sell, and the market responded immediately. Bitcoin slid to a little over $112,000, a level that previously acted as the launchpad for the rally that pushed prices to the all-time high of $124,000 this August. Traders are now watching that number like hawks, questioning if it can act as a safety net once more. Technical signals, however, don’t tell a unified story. The relative strength index sits at 32.90, scraping the oversold zone, which can sometimes hint at an exhausted sell-off. But the MACD is still weak, with its line staying under the signal mark, suggesting negative momentum. This split in indicators keeps traders guessing whether the next big move will be up or down. If $112,000 holds, a rebound is on the table. Break it, and the downside could accelerate, especially if institutions start unloading more Bitcoin. Add whale accumulation, seasonal weakness, and a looming Fed decision, and the short-term outlook looks less like a straight line and more like a curve with surprises waiting around the bend. For now, the battle is clear. It’s between confidence and fear, and the outcome may depend on what happens before this month closes.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Tokenized stock trading: The huge risks in moving stocks to blockchain
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/22/tokenized-stock-trading-the-huge-risks-in-moving-stocks-to-blockchain/
Time Published: 2025-08-22T14:00:06Z

By James Royal, Ph.D., Bankrate.com The cryptocurrency industry has lately begun to heavily promote tokenized stocks, but what exactly are they? More importantly, what advantages do tokenized stocks offer — especially when investors already have safe, no-cost fractional share trading at many brokers? A tokenized stock is a fancy way of saying that ownership of a stock can be transferred via blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency. Tokenizing, or digitizing, assets such as stocks, ETFs and other securities allows them to be traded on a specialized digital exchange and potentially directly between investors without the need for an exchange. These tokens are held in a digital wallet, much as crypto coins are, similar to a traditional brokerage account. “The news cycle for crypto is all about representing traditional financial assets on a blockchain,” says Hilary Allen, professor, American University Washington College of Law. But Allen points out that investors and financial markets will endure major costs for doing so: “There are a lot of protections that are given up by this move.” In order to establish a tokenized stock, these steps are needed: — Taking custody of the asset: The asset that will be tokenized needs to be held in custody by a custodian, whose job is to safeguard it on behalf of the token creator. — Creating the token: A financial institution such as an investment bank or fintech company then creates the digitized token, which corresponds to the asset in custody. — Setting up smart contracts: Each token is programmed with self-executing smart contracts that give the token’s owner the same rights as stock ownership, including dividend distributions and voting rights, among others. Once the stock is tokenized, traders can exchange it among themselves on crypto platforms, other decentralized finance platforms or even potentially a traditional stock brokerage. For example, crypto exchange Kraken has created tokenized stocks that it calls xStocks, and now allows trading in 60 major stocks. Meanwhile, brokerage Robinhood launched token trading in the European Union in June, offering access to more than 200 U.S. stock and ETF tokens. Asset managers BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already offer tokenized money market funds. Goldman Sachs and BNY are teaming up to launch their own tokenized money market funds, too. More firms are exploring the idea of tokenized stocks. In short, you could think of a tokenized stock as one that trades via blockchain. So what’s the big deal for individual investors? The cryptocurrency industry is breathlessly hyping this as a huge leap forward – as it has done for crypto coins – but the benefits are modest for individual investors, especially buy-and-hold types, and the risks of tokenized stocks are high. In fact, the best stock brokers already offer many of these same benefits to investors at no cost. The crypto industry touts the following benefits of tokenized stock trading, many of which are already features at top brokers or may soon be features. — Increased accessibility through fractional shares: Tokenized stocks let investors trade portions of a share, meaning that high-priced stocks are accessible to even those with a little money. — Lower cost: The crypto industry touts the potentially lower cost of transactions by eliminating intermediaries via blockchain. — Transparency: The industry says thatby recording ownership on the blockchain, tokenization ensures that ownership is established. — Security: Proponents say that blockchain-enabled trading also increases security because ownership is irrevocably established on the blockchain. — 24/7 trading: Because tokenized stocks are held on a blockchain, they can be traded at any hour. — Immediate settling of trades: Proponents also point to the immediate settling of trades via tokenized stocks, in contrast to next-day settlement in the U.S. — More direct access between investors and firms: Tokenization may bypass existing financial intermediaries, letting companies raise money more directly from investors. Others note the serious risks in tokenizing stocks, particularly in the area of investor protection. — Potentially irrevocable transactions: Like cryptocurrency transactions, a tokenized stock transaction may be irrevocable. Once it’s done, it’s done, and it may be all but impossible to undo. — Uncertain legal protections: The legal treatment of tokenized stocks is way behind where the crypto industry is trying to go, exposing investors to plenty of risks. For example, who is considered the issuer of a tokenized stock: the firm that tokenized it or the stock’s original issuer? What happens if an asset is hacked? — Inflexible smart contracts: Smart contracts programmed into tokenized stocks will not cover all circumstances, says Allen. “It’s not clear how they’ll operate in unexpected environments.” — Circumventing investor protections: Private investments are private partially to protect investors, not merely to limit investments to the well-heeled, but tokenizing stocks can allow financial players to get around the rules. “It’s absolutely built as an end run around securities laws,” says Allen. “Crypto is built as an end run around securities laws.” — Loss of trust in American financial markets: One of the potential long-term effects of not enforcing existing securities laws is the erosion of trust in American capital markets. If securities laws aren’t enforced or are enforced inconsistently, then markets simply become a place to rip off investors. Bankrate reached out to Kraken and Robinhood for further comment but has not heard back. The crypto industry and some traditional financial institutions have talked a big game about tokenization of stocks and some players have moved toward tokenization. But what’s in it for individual investors? Many of tokenization’s supposed benefits touted by the crypto industry are already available for individual investors in the current system. — Fractional shares already exist: Individual investors can already access fractional shares — on thousands of stocks and ETFs — at the best brokers for fractional shares. — Stock trading is already commission-free: For individual investors, trading stocks is already free at every major online broker, so there’s no added benefit to using tokenized stocks. — Transparency and security: Existing brokers already have high levels of security with a proven security process. In fact, it’s the crypto exchanges and other DeFi platforms that have been beset by lax security, fraud and theft. — After-hours trading: Many brokers already offer after-hours, overnight and pre-market trading on existing stocks. While this is not 24/7 trading, brokers have been expanding access in recent years. Moreover, all-hours access to trading does not benefit long-term investors, who build wealth through the long-term success of the underlying business. Study after study shows that active trading underperforms passive investing. — “Democratization” of investing: Proponents of tokenization say that it gives access to private investments that are being hoarded by the wealthy. But giving a means to trade a stock — tokenizing it — does not mean that anyone will want to sell it to you. In fact, you should be skeptical when someone wants to sell you what they say is a great investment. (If it’s such a great investment, why are they letting you in on it? It’s not out of the kindness of their heart.) So, while tokenization may offer a few incremental benefits to individual investors, albeit with significant risks, what’s the real driver of tokenization? Who is actually going to benefit here? It’s the crypto industry trying to make inroads into traditional finance, say experts. “The crypto industry is waging a multi-pronged battle to get integrated into the financial system,” says Allen. The industry is working to “attract deep pockets” and bring more money into the fold, and tokenized stocks are part of that push, she explains. So much of the crypto world is about hyping digital currency as “the next big thing.” Part of that process is projecting bombastic price targets for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ones that are always rising over time. Such hype can make cryptocurrency seem inevitable. As with cryptocurrency, one of the biggest use-cases for stock tokenization is (illegally) getting around existing laws (in this case, securities laws). So the full-bore adoption of stock tokenization has many potentially destructive effects, including the erosion of investor protections and robust securities laws that protect financial markets. Without these laws, it’s “scammer take all.” “Investors lose the benefit of the securities laws,” says Allen. She points out that what the crypto industry wants to run roughshod over are the very laws that they claim are roadblocks to their profits. ”We saw what happened in the 1920s and the lack of securities laws.” Tokenization presents significant risks to individual investors and the financial markets as a whole, while offering few benefits to investors that don’t already exist. Those who try out tokenized stocks should remain wary of their many risks amid an uncertain legal framework. ©2025 Bankrate.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our company,” or “MFH”) (Nasdaq: MFH), a blockchain-powered fintech group, today announced that a broad range of institutional investors reported holdings in MFH in their latest regulatory filings. Recent 13F and related regulatory disclosures report institutional positions in MFH by major index and asset managers, global banks, and ETF sponsors, reflecting a larger and more diverse institutional holder base for MFH compared to prior periods. Reported filers include BlackRock, Geode Capital Management, State Street, Vanguard, Northern Trust, and others. The Company has also observed that several notable pension funds — including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System of New Jersey, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund — have also slightly increased their holdings of the Company’s stock. Both new filers and additional positions from existing institutions contributed to the increase in institutional exposure, and largely follow the Company's inclusion in the Russell 2000 index. Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers for index funds and are commonly employed as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Though these index-driven acquisitions are primarily mechanical, reflecting index-related or passive investment activity, and should not be viewed as a strategic endorsement of the Company, MFH views the expanding institutional presence as a meaningful acknowledgement of its fintech and digital asset platform development. "Having more institutional investors on board is exciting for us," said Shi Qiu, CEO of MFH. "It not only brings more liquidity to our stock but also puts us in front of a wider investment community. While we understand much of this activity is potentially index-related, we're confident that as we continue building out our fintech capabilities and delivering results, these relationships will deepen." About the filingsThe summary above draws on Form 13F and related regulatory filings reported in early to mid-August 2025. Institutional holdings can change at any time, may be reported through multiple affiliated entities, and many positions are passive. References to institutional names are based solely on publicly available filings and are provided for informational purposes only.The inclusion of MFH in institutional portfolios does not necessarily represent an investment recommendation or active investment decision.

Title: Bitcoin’s Collective Action Problem

ByKorok Ray, Contributor. Its greatest asset is also its greatest liability. It is difficult to find legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin. The software was remarkably well-designed from the outset. The network has withstood attacks for over a decade, and the protocol uniquely combines cutting-edge computer science with Austrian economics. And of course, the massive institutional buying this year—along with retail participation since inception—is already proof that Bitcoin holds value in the marketplace. There are, of course, the usual criticisms: energy consumption, high fees, limited programmability, and scaling challenges. But these issues are not new; they’ve been discussed on the mailing list since Bitcoin's earliest days. Let me instead focus on what I believe to be the only real threat to Bitcoin—and it’s not a technical flaw in Bitcoin itself, but rather a challenge within the social structure surrounding it. Bitcoin is unique—not just among cryptocurrencies, but among social organizations in general—because no one is in charge. Unlike companies like Ripple, which have CEOs, or even altcoins like Ethereum, which have foundations, Bitcoin exists without a central authority. Satoshi disappeared, and now no single individual controls Bitcoin’s destiny. The closest thing to a governing body is the group of Core developers who maintain Bitcoin Core and decide on software updates. To the extent that anyone holds influence over Bitcoin, it is this group of developers. But even they are decentralized. They are scattered around the globe, and they themselves must respond to social consensus. Even if the Core devs were to push for a radical protocol change, node operators could simply reject the new version and continue running an older, backward-compatible one. As with everything in game theory, the mere threat of this type of rejection enforces an equilibrium—ensuring that Core developers conform to community expectations and avoid radical departures. So what’s the problem? A collective action problem arises when the benefits are shared, but the costs are private. The classic example is a group of farmers sharing a plot of land: no one wants to clean it; each farmer bears the full cost of the work but only receives a portion of the benefit. This problem appears in all environments with shared resources. Economic theory offers some solutions, but they are imperfect. The best approach is to introduce a third party who can create contracts that align private costs with social benefits. This research area is known as the private provision of public goods. A creative solution is the “Groupon” mechanism, where a shared benefit activates only if a sufficient number of individuals opt in. Economist Mark Bagnoli at Purdue wrote a paper on this in the 1990s. I also published a paper in Management Science in 2015 on how to allocate shared cloud computing resources among individual users. The core idea: users must be overcharged to prevent overconsumption of the shared resource. In Bitcoin, the challenge isn’t overuse of a shared resource, but rather the difficulty of collective decision-making. Because no one is in charge, progress stalls when there’s no clear winner among proposals. This, in my view, is what has happened with covenants. They’ve been proposed for over 7 years. Since then, no dominant proposal has emerged. And when no one is in charge, no proposal gets adopted. Quantum computing has been discussed as a long-term threat to Bitcoin’s digital signatures since the early mailing lists. Back then, it seemed distant. Even now, we’re still decades away. But it would be naive to think it will never arrive. This raises the question: what is the best post-quantum signature scheme for Bitcoin? This was a topic of discussion at the Quantum Summit at Presidio Bitcoin in July, where proposals included intricate tree-based hash functions. If one clearly superior post-quantum signature scheme emerges, I see no threat to Bitcoin. The challenge arises if multiple, roughly equal, proposals exist—each with different tradeoffs and no clear winner. This would be similar to the covenant situation. If the community fractures over which path to take, and no consensus emerges, adoption may be stalled. I see this as a tail risk—but a real one. Some argue that major Bitcoin holders—like BlackRock, Strategy, or a federation of “OGs”—could unite to push forward a single standard and prevent Bitcoin from being vulnerable to quantum attacks. But this raises a further question: if investors can reach consensus, why not the Core developers? The edge case here is that several post-quantum signature schemes are so equally compelling that no one can agree. And in that edge case, centralization has a benefit: it allows someone to make the final decision. I saw this dynamic firsthand while working in the George W. Bush White House. The president’s role in the policy process is to act as the final decision-maker. If the choice were obvious, it would have been settled by committees earlier. The very fact that an issue reaches the president’s desk means the staff is evenly split. The president is the tiebreaker. And that, ultimately, is the real function of a central executive. Let’s hope that among the post-quantum proposals, a clear winner emerges—so we can all upgrade peacefully and move to a secure, post-quantum Bitcoin future.

August 22, 2025 07:00 ET | Source: CertiK CertiK NEW YORK, Aug. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CertiK, the largest Web3 security services provider, released its 2025 Skynet Real World Asset (RWA) Security Report, providing a framework of structured criteria for users to perform due diligence and assess risks associated with various RWA protocols. RWAs are gaining prominence in the industry, as more users seek to unlock value by bringing traditional assets on-chain, thus benefiting from increased efficiency and accessibility during transfers. However, as CertiK notes, the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop such RWAs also introduces complex security challenges that extend far beyond familiar smart contract vulnerabilities. Such hybrid security risks include oracle manipulation, custodial and counterparty failures, the unenforceability of legal frameworks, and fraudulent Proof-of-Reserve attestations. In this report, CertiK also provides data on the current threat landscape involving RWAs. For instance, direct losses from RWA-specific exploits reached approximately $14.6 million in the first half of 2025, following fluctuating annual losses of $6 million in 2024 and $17.9 million in 2023. As is the case with all decentralized products, as more users come on-chain, there will be more capital for malicious actors to exploit, hence the need for increased security. According to CertiK’s RWA framework detailed in the report, the highest-rated protocols, such as those offered by TradFi giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, exhibit strong security postures by integrating institutional-grade compliance, custody, and transparency. Additional projects in the top five on the Skynet RWA Leaderboard include Ondo Finance, PAX Gold, and Tether Gold. As CertiK notes, RWA growth is concentrated in key blockchains and protocols. Most RWA value currently resides on select blockchains, such as Ethereum, which means that the overall sustainability of the RWA market is dependent on the security and operational integrity of a few key players and their underlying chains. Consequently, proactive collaboration with leading security firms will be essential for both existing and future RWA projects. Download the full report here.

A starter for the four All-Ireland SFC titles the Jackies secured in succession from 2017 to 2020, Byrne lined out at centre-half-back when the capital county regained their top-tier crown with an impressive showpiece victory over Kerry in 2023. She featured in the same position at Croke Park on 3 August as Dublin overcame provincial rivals Meath on a final score of 2-16 to 0-10 – a comprehensive reverse of the All-Ireland championship final meeting of the same teams in 2021. This win helped to complete a successful first season at the helm for joint-managers Paul Casey and Derek Murray, who had previously served as selectors under highly-respected predecessor Mick Bohan. This is one of several reasons why Byrne believes her sixth All-Ireland triumph is up there as one of her best in a Dublin jersey. "As you come towards the end of your career, you kind of appreciate and realise that winning All-Irelands don’t just come. I think that made it a little bit more special. Particularly under Paul and Derek, who have been such brilliant coaches for us over the last few years," Byrne explained. "Obviously they had big shoes to fill when Mick left, so I think a lot of us were really keen to get over the line for them as well. It made it particularly special to win this one. I think sometimes when you go on a run you think ‘okay, we’re in a good place here to maybe win another one’. "When you lose quarter-finals and finals, that is when you start to realise that you really have to work extra hard to get into winning positions. It was a good run, but I think after the last few years, where we’ve had our ups and downs and won finals in ’23 and ’25, they’ve been even sweeter. Because we’ve had to really put our shoulder to the wheel to get over the line on those occasions." Prior to Nicole Owens rattling the net in the sixth minute of their victory over the Royals at GAA HQ earlier this month, Hannah Tyrrell got the ball rolling for Dublin in the Jones’ Road venue with a 0-02 salvo. It was fitting that this attacking pair made such an impact in the early exchanges of the contest as both players officially announced their retirements from inter-county football in the aftermath of the game. A debutant all the way back in 2012, Owens finished her Dublin senior odyssey with an excellent haul of five All-Ireland senior titles. Tyrrell did feature for the Sky Blues in the 2013 and 2014 inter-county seasons, before subsequently returning in 2021 after bringing the curtain down on an international rugby career that saw her representing Ireland at both 7s and 15s level. Top scorer with eight points when Dublin got the better of Kerry in the '23 decider, Tyrrell’s 0-05 tally against Meath at the beginning of the month helped her to claim the ZuCar Golden Boot for 2025. She was unfortunately forced off with a knee injury in the closing moments, but her contribution to the Dublin cause over the past five seasons has been immeasurable and Byrne was glad that she and Owens were able to sign off with another success. "Obviously it’s incredibly unfortunate that Hannah has done her knee and injured herself, but it was almost kind of nice in a way that she got a standing ovation and a send-off. A recognition of all the achievements she has gathered over the years across multiple sports. "Nicole and Hannah are both incredible sportswomen and obviously it’s sad that they’re retiring, but it was a great way to send them off." Byrne has been a considerable stalwart herself for Dublin, having first represented the county at the senior grade all the way back in 2013. Yet while the registered dietitian at Beaumont Hospital currently resides in Stoneybatter on the northside of the capital, her family home is actually in Bray, Co. Wicklow. However, she attended primary school in Scoil Lorcáin – located between Blackrock and Monkstown in south Dublin - and this led to her joining forces with Cuala. From there she ultimately progressed through the Sky Blue ranks and given the nature of her household, Byrne was always going to choose this path. "The principal of the primary school that I was in was a big Cuala man. Anyone I think that had any interest in playing camogie or football, he directed them straight away to Cuala. I think that’s how my older sister got involved in Cuala and then I was the same as well. "My parents are both from Dublin, so growing up my Dad would have brought me to Dublin games. Even though we were living in Wicklow, I have a granny who is a huge Dubs supporter herself. I think it was only ever going to be a Dublin club." After winning a Dublin Junior ‘A’ football championship crown with Cuala in 2017, Byrne played a pivotal role when the Dalkey-based outfit claimed an intermediate county title at the expense of Castleknock in 2020. Having begun their Go-Ahead Senior Championship Group B campaign for the current season with a draw at home to Na Fianna three days ago, Byrne and Cuala will renew acquaintances with Castleknock at Somerton Park next Wednesday (27 August). Further encounters with Clontarf and reigning Dublin and Leinster champions Kilmacud Crokes will follow on 10 September and 17 September respectively as Byrne continues her readjustment to the club scene. "You’ve had a few months of keeping the head down and working really hard, and then you have a little break and you go back at it again," Byrne added. "It will be a tough few weeks, but our club team, we feel like we’re in a really good place between the players and the coaches that we have. We’re just going to have to trust the process, put the work in and hope that we can get the right results." © RTÉ 2025.

The announcement follows the conclusion of an internal probe into WEF founder Klaus Schwab. The announcement follows the conclusion of an internal probe into WEF founder Klaus Schwab. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has appointedÂ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding Vice-Chairman AndrÃ© Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. According to Brighteon AI's Enoch,Â Fink, who co-founded the world's largest asset management firm in 1988, has long advocated for stakeholder capitalism and sustainable investing. Meanwhile, Hoffmann, a prominent environmental philanthropist and sustainability advocate, has hailed from the founding family of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant and has held key roles in sustainability and philanthropy, including leadership at the WWF International and the Hoffmann Global Institute for Business and Society (INSEAD), while driving Roche's focus on innovation in healthcare and corporate responsibility Hoffman has served on the WEF board and supported numerous global health and ecological initiatives. In line with this,Â Fink and Hoffmann expressed a shared commitment to strengthening the Forum's mission amid growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. "We are honored to take on this leadership role on an interim basis at a pivotal time for the World Economic Forum. As the organization moves into a new chapter, we look ahead with clarity, purpose and confidence in the Forum's enduring mission.Â The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government and civil society has never been greater. We believe the Forum can serve as a unique catalyst for cooperation, one that fosters trust, identifies shared goals and turns dialogue into action," the co-chairs wrote in their joint statement published on the official WEF website on Aug. 15. (Related:Â CIA, WEF run the entire mainstream media empire.) The interim leadership will guide the Forum through a transitional period as it redefines its strategic priorities for the coming decade. "We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. We look forward to helping shape a more resilient and prosperous future, and to reinventing and strengthening the Forum as an indispensable institution for public-private cooperation," they added. WEF clears Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing after probe, citing "deep commitment" amid minor irregularities The announcement follows the Forum's closing of its internal investigation into itsÂ founder, Klaus Schwab, clearing him of any "wrongdoing." In April,Â an anonymous whistleblower letterÂ scrutinized Schwab's leadership practices, the WEF's governance and alleged blurring of lines between the Schwab family's personal activities and Forum resources. That same month, an investigation beganÂ â a day after Schwab abruptly stepped down as chairman, without explanation. Schwab filed a criminal complaint against the anonymous whistleblowers in May, but a spokesperson confirmed Friday that he intends to drop all legal actions now that the investigation has concluded.Â The Geneva-based organization said on Friday its board found "no evidence of material wrongdoing" by Schwab or his wife and longtime assistant, Hilde Schwab. Despite acknowledging "minor irregularities" stemming from blurred boundaries between personal contributions and organizational operations, the Forum concluded that these reflected Schwab's "deep commitment" rather than misconduct. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said.

Title: Gaza City Offensive Tests Gulf States’ Red Lines on Israel

The political price inside the Gulf rises when the operation looks like an occupation or when casualty optics dominate regional media cycles; that’s when Riyadh slows the normalization narrative down and Abu Dhabi tightens the valves at the working level (permits, high?profile joint events, finance?compliance scrutiny), but without blowing any deals up. The signaling is already visible in the region’s news flow: coverage emphasizing a looming Gaza City takeover and a new reservist surge sits alongside Arab statements that place full responsibility on Israel for the humanitarian catastrophe, language that gives Gulf capitals room to keep their normalization track intact, while warning that tactical indulgence isn’t a blank check. Watch for two concrete gauges of patience: whether Saudi officials allow any new “process” optics to move in public while bombardment intensifies, and whether Emirati ministries let routine, mid?tier engagement with Israeli counterparts proceed on autopilot or begin to drag.

Watch for two concrete gauges of patience: whether Saudi officials allow any new “process” optics to move in public while bombardment intensifies, and whether Emirati ministries let routine, mid?tier engagement with Israeli counterparts proceed on autopilot or begin to drag. The much-awaited Trump-Putin summit and talks with Zelensky failed to deliver on ceasefire expectations. In Anchorage, Trump and Putin met with minimal fanfare around Ukraine but, behind the scenes, a seismic shift was underway in Russia’s oil sector. On the same day as the summit, Putin issued a decree greenlighting ExxonMobil’s return to the Sakhalin-1 project, a major state-linked venture shelved in 2022 under sanctions (keep in mind, it’s a pathway to return, not a return itself). Exxon’s re-entry is conditional on helping roll back those very sanctions. This isn’t just corporate re-entry; it’s a political signal that Washington may be open, quietly, to leveraging energy firms as sanctions lifelines, which is exactly what traders were banking on. The revival of Exxon’s Sakhalin-1 involvement lays the groundwork for deeper economic reintegration, funding Russia’s oil expansion and infrastructure that suffered post-2022. Ukraine gets relegated to the talking points, while oil and energy firms, long sidelined by sanctions, become back channels for geopolitical recalibration (completely transactional geopolitics, which we are seeing elsewhere, as well, including in Libya. Elections in Guyana and troop movements off Venezuela’s coast are converging into a single fault line for the southern Caribbean. Georgetown is heading toward its September 1 vote with a new wildcard candidate, Azruddin Mohamed, whose gold-trading dynasty has been sanctioned by Washington for smuggling and tax evasion. His run under a freshly minted party is unlikely to deliver power, but even a small parliamentary bloc would inject sanctioned capital into the legislative process just as Guyana’s oil wealth transforms its economy. Across the border, Caracas is flexing hard: Maduro has mobilized millions of militia members in response to a U.S. task force of warships and 4,000 troops deployed off Venezuela’s coast. The choreography on both fronts matters. Guyana risks entangling its oil boom in sanctioned networks at the very moment it needs investor confidence, while Venezuela is doubling down on sovereignty theatrics to turn U.S. naval presence into domestic consolidation. This week has seen a quiet but vital turning point in Baghdad?Erbil relations. Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government have taken a significant step toward reviving northern crude exports. A formal mechanism has now been agreed: the KRG will retain a modest 50,000 bpd for local consumption, while the remainder will be channeled through SOMO for export. The agreement clears the federal checklist; what remains is the final hurdle, which is getting Ankara on board to reopen the pipeline. Yet the arrangement is only as real as Turkey allows it to be. Ankara still controls the tap, and until it agrees to reopen the pipeline, Baghdad and Erbil’s accord remains aspirational. Deals, Mergers & Acquisitions Black Hills (BKH) and NorthWestern Energy (NWE) agreed to merge in an all-stock deal creating a $15.4B regulated utility, one of the largest U.S. utility tie-ups this year. NorthWestern holders will get 0.98 BKH shares each, valuing NWE at $3.6B, with BKH shareholders owning 56% of the new company. The combined firm, headquartered in Rapid City, SD, will serve 2.1M customers across eight states, boosting planned capex beyond the $7.4B earmarked through 2029. Management projects EPS growth of 5–7% post-close in late 2026, up from the prior 4–6%, as AI-driven data centers and higher demand from crypto and households fuel grid investment needs. Peabody Energy (BTU) has scrapped its $3.78B bid for Anglo American’s (AAL) Bowen Basin coking coal mines, after trying and failing to cut the price following an April fire at Moranbah North. Peabody says the blaze triggered a material adverse change clause, a claim Anglo flatly rejects. The setback slows Anglo’s push to shed non-core coal assets after last year’s failed BHP takeover. Allgas Energy’s Queensland gas network has been put up for sale for about A$600M. The system stretches over 13,000 km of pipelines and supplies roughly 120,000 customers, making it one of the largest privately owned networks in the country. Macquarie Capital is running the process, and early signs point to plenty of interest given the steady cash flows. Owner APA Group is looking to slim down its portfolio and free up cash for other projects Santos (STO.AX) warned that ADNOC’s $18.7B takeover bid won’t hit its August 22 deadline, with the consortium asking for at least four more weeks to secure approvals. The delay rattled investors, knocking Santos shares down 3.5% to A$7.68—well below the A$8.89 per share offer—highlighting persistent skepticism. If completed, the deal would value Santos at A$36.4B enterprise value, the largest all-cash buyout in Australian history, but faces hurdles with regulators in Australia, PNG, and the U.S. The biggest sticking point remains Canberra’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which is unlikely to wave through Middle Eastern ownership of critical gas assets without scrutiny. Discovery & Development Aker BP (AKRBP.OL) and partners Equinor (EQNR.OL) and Orlen (PKN.WA) hit one of Norway’s biggest oil finds in a decade, uncovering 96–134 million boe at the Omega Alfa prospect in the Yggdrasil area. The discovery spans three licences, with Aker BP holding up to 47.7% and Equinor 40%. CEO Karl Johnny Hersvik called it a major commercial find, and the group plans to chase further upside nearby. The result materially boosts resources at Yggdrasil, one of the North Sea’s most active development hubs. Iraq inked an agreement in principle with Chevron (CVX) to develop the Nassiriya project, covering four exploration blocks plus producing fields. The deal marks a turnaround as Iraq improves contract terms to lure back majors after years of retreat. Recent reforms have already pulled in TotalEnergies (TTE) and BP (BP.L) with more than $50B committed. Nassiriya could eventually produce up to 600,000 bpd, making it one of Iraq’s most ambitious oil developments in years. Putin signed a decree reopening the door for ExxonMobil (XOM) to reclaim its former 30% stake in Sakhalin-1, three years after Moscow seized the project. The move coincided with Trump’s Alaska summit with Putin, where sanctions relief and new U.S.–Russia investment were key agenda points. Exxon had written off $4.6B when it exited Russia in 2022, and any return would hinge on Western sanctions being lifted plus new commitments like equipment supply and capital transfers. The decree also makes clear that foreign investors must actively support easing sanctions if they want back in, underscoring the political strings tied to Russia’s top Far East oil project. ExxonMobil (XOM) signed a massive deepwater exploration deal with Trinidad & Tobago, covering more than 2,700 square miles east of the island in waters 6,500 feet deep. The agreement comes after six months of negotiations and could lead to as much as $21.7B in spending if sizable reserves turn up, with seismic work due to start soon and drilling to follow. Exxon is aiming to mirror its Guyana play, leaning on shared infrastructure across the basin. Port of Spain, meanwhile, is pushing to revive its energy sector, with PM Kamla Persad-Bissessar stressing oversight while insisting the country won’t hold back on developing its resources. Saudi Aramco struck an $11B lease-and-leaseback deal with a BlackRock-led Global Infrastructure Partners consortium tied to its massive Jafurah unconventional gas project. The package includes gas processing and NGL facilities, but Aramco will still run the assets. Jafurah is estimated to hold 229 tcf of gas and 75 billion barrels of condensates, making it one of the world’s largest unconventional gas fields. The deal gives Aramco fresh capital while underpinning long-term growth from its biggest gas play. To access this exclusive content...

Title: Bitcoin’s Next Stop For 2025? $175,000, According To SOL Strategies Boss

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The chief executive officer of SOL Strategies has a strong belief in the potential of Bitcoin, despite recent setbacks by the top crypto asset. Leah Wald told members of the press she expects bitcoin to make a steep move before year end. Her baseline? The vaunted $175,000 mark – a price she called a conservative read compared to some loftier forecasts. The market has already surprised a lot of people — bitcoin hit about $124,000 recently — so big swings are not impossible. According to Wald, part of the push comes from big money moving in. She pointed to companies like BlackRock and high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood, and she referenced how comments from leaders like Larry Fink have shifted conversations. Those voices bring models and balance-sheet plans that, she said during a CNBC TV18 interview, support much higher price targets than people used to expect. The industry’s own scars are still visible. After the FTX collapse many firms were de-banked and trust took a hit. But Wald argues that the picture has changed: banks and asset managers are opening doors again, and that makes it easier for large managers to put serious capital into crypto. That doesn’t erase risk though, but it does change how big investors approach the market. Based on reports, some forecasts stretch far beyond this year. Wald mentioned projections showing bitcoin at $1 million by 2030, a level that would dwarf current prices. Those long-range calls are driven by assumptions about adoption, limited supply and the role bitcoin could play in institutional portfolios. Whether reality matches those models is another question. Shorter-term math matters too. If bitcoin were to reach $175,000 before year end, that would be a rapid climb from recent levels around $124,000. Traders and managers watching volatility know such moves can happen, but they also know the path is rarely straight. Expectations, flows, and news — all of it moves markets fast. Wald says crypto is no longer just about quick gains. She sees a bigger change: mainstream finance is being rebuilt on blockchain tools, she said, and that shift is moving the conversation away from short-term trading toward how the system is built and run. Nation-states thinking about adoption and big asset managers planning custody services are part of that picture, she added, and those pieces matter for how prices form.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The regulator first issued a consent order to Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank, in 2022 due to its “failure to adopt and implement a compliance program” that satisfactorily covered the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. “The OCC believes that the safety and soundness of the bank and its compliance with laws and regulations does not require the continued existence of the order,” the termination order reads. In 2021, Anchorage Digital made history when the @USOCC granted us a national bank charter to serve as a full-scale digital asset bank, providing custody, trading, settlement, governance, and other regulated services for institutions. pic.twitter.com/sMKwq3tTfv — Anchorage Digital ⚓ Prime is Live (@Anchorage) August 21, 2025 Anchorage Digital received conditional approval from the OCC in 2021, allowing it to offer crypto custody services to its customers and making it the first federally chartered bank to custody digital assets. After demonstrating the appropriate compliance, the consent order has now been terminated. “When we applied for that charter, we knew what we were signing up for: the path forward was uncharted for any crypto company, and at the time, many in our industry—and most of Washington—felt that digital assets and regulation were like oil and water,” said Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley in a statement Thursday. “We embarked on that path not because it was easy, but because we knew it was the right long-term move for the industry—laying the foundation for trust, safety, and durability in the years ahead,” he added. “And in an industry intent on ‘going to the moon,’ the seeming impossibility of our federal charter mission lit a fire under us from the start.” The South Dakota-based firm specializes in custody, staking, trading, and governance for its members. In April, BlackRock chose Anchorage to custody some of the Bitcoin and Ethereum held for the asset manager’s industry-leading spot ETFs. In May, the OCC affirmed that national banks it oversees can buy, sell, and manage any crypto assets in their custody. Since that time, stablecoin issuer Circle as well as Ripple and Paxos have applied for charters that would make them nationally regulated banks.

The bank said it had partnered with digital platforms ADDX, DigiFT, and HydraX to distribute the product. DBS told Decrypt that the first tokenized structured note will be linked to the performance of Bitcoin. Structured notes blend debt securities and derivatives contracts to provide investors with exposure to a range of assets, including stocks and commodities. They are linked to an underlying asset and pay the investor a regular return. With DBS's latest product, the underlying asset will be cryptocurrencies. "The note structure provides investors with a cash payout when cryptocurrency prices rise, enabling them to build exposure to the asset class without having to manage any cryptocurrency," the bank said. "The note is also structured to mitigate potential losses should cryptocurrency prices decline." DBS said that by tokenizing such assets, they can become "more fungible and easier to trade." "Asset tokenisation is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure," DBS' Head of Foreign Exchange and Digital Assets, Global Financial Markets, Li Zhen, said. "Our first tokenised product, a crypto-linked note, also addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets," he added. The bank isn't the first to offer such a product. Wall Street giant BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, debuted its first tokenized fund last year. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum. And BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has repeatedly spoken about tokenizing assets. Other major financial services firms are also exploring tokenization initiatives, including Bank of America and Citi. In a report this May, the World Economic Forum said that tokenization had "the potential to unlock the next generation of value exchange in financial markets." "While barriers remain, momentum continues to build, and financial institutions, policy-makers and technology providers need to coordinate regulation, interoperability and consumer protections to safely usher in this evolution," the authors of "Asset Tokenization in Financial Markets: The Next Generation of Value Exchange" wrote.

Title: Trillions and Trillions of Dollars to Pour into Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu: Kraken Co-CEO

Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi believes that we are still very early in the crypto adoption cycle, and trillions and trillions of dollars are going to pour into the cryptocurrency ecosystem in the near future. The crypto executive gave these comments during the ongoing Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in the USA. According to Sethi: “….., the way we think about it is very linear, and it is hard to think about what is exponential or non-linear. The way I like to think about it is that we are just in the really, really early innings of what is going to be trillions and trillions of dollars coming into the ecosystem, building against it, and the value is going to continue to grow….” Sethi co-executed the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange during the first altcoin boom, and the platform has since become a popular choice among crypto traders. In addition to Kraken, he is the chairman of Tribe Capital and has invested in over 100 tech companies overall. He was invited to speak at the Blockchain symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and the host discussed a wide range of topics with him. He is upbeat about the future of the cryptocurrency economy and the space it is creating for entrepreneurs. What Sethi is referring to here is the fact that institutional investors are increasingly focusing their attention on the digital currency revolution. These big players, along with increasing interest in the retail investment scene, can pour trillions and trillions of dollars into crypto in the coming years, if not months. According to Bill Miller IV, a renowned American institutional investor, a small fraction of the money held by retirement funds around the world can make a big difference. The portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners said during a recent CNBC interview: “1% of the 60 trillion in global retirement funds could boost Bitcoin’s price by $30k.” This scenario is within the realm of possibility as multiple top retirement funds have expressed a desire to invest in Bitcoin, and many have already done it, albeit at a smaller scale. On the other side of the investment spectrum, big asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck are heavily invested in digital currency already. Together, these major capital players can drive the digital currency market to unprecedented heights.

August 21, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS / XICE: OCS) (“Oculis”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on breakthrough innovations to address significant unmet medical needs in ophthalmology and neuro-ophthalmology, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and provided an overview of the Company’s progress. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, states: “We maintain a strong focus on execution to advance our portfolio of highly differentiated assets in areas with significant unmet medical needs. The rapid enrollment in both Phase 3 DIAMOND trials highlights strong support from the medical community for OCS-01, which aims to become the first eye drop treatment for diabetic macular edema, with topline results expected in Q2 2026. We are also preparing Licaminlimab’s (OCS-02) genotype-based Phase 2/3 trial in 2H 2025 to deliver a first personalized medicine treatment in dry eye disease. Moreover, encouraging Phase 2 ACUITY trial results for Privosegtor (OCS-05) in acute optic neuritis, which showed significant improvement in visual function as well as anatomical and biological neuroprotective benefits, are unlocking a new era of potential therapies targeting neuronal and axonal preservation, and addressing a long-standing gap in neuroprotection for the first time. These strong efficacy signals open opportunities across ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, and neurology.” Recent Clinical Highlights and Upcoming Milestones: Second Half 2025 Financial Results As of June 30, 2025, Oculis held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of CHF 160.3 million or $201.3 million. Research and development expenses were CHF 14.9 million or $18.1 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 16.5 million or $18.2 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of two completed trials in 2024, partially offset by ongoing trials and increased R&D personnel-related costs. General and administrative expenses were CHF 6.1 million or $7.4 million for the three-months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 6.3 million or $6.9 million in the same period in 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in external professional services costs incurred in the prior year period. Year-to-date net loss was CHF 58.6 million or $67.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to CHF 36.9 million or $41.5 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by advancements in clinical development programs and a CHF 10.4 million or $12.1 million increase in the non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant liabilities as a result of appreciation of underlying warrant fair value. Upcoming Events: Medical Conferences and Industry Events Investor Conferences About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

FRANKLIN, TN — According to sources, a local Gen Z college graduate $200,000 in debt with a minimum wage job was celebrating by shopping for a new $750,000 home at 20% interest. "I worked hard and followed the rules, and now it's time to reap the benefits," said Liam Oliver Franklin, who recently acquired a highly sought-after job in his field for $7.25 per hour. "Now, should I buy the 1-bedroom house in the slums for $750,000, or the 1-bedroom house in the suburbs for $1.2 million? Decisions, decisions." Franklin reportedly graduated with honors from a prestigious university after studying hard his entire life. He was told by admissions that his massive student loans would be paid off in no time. "My only concern is figuring out how to pay my $1800 per month loan payment while also affording a $12,000 house payment," he said. "I might have to get a job driving for DoorDash. They pay well, right?" At publishing time, Franklin had decided to settle for a $2,000 per month apartment owned by BlackRock while saving up for a home and earning money on the side by making racist memes to post on X.

Title: UK's third-largest steelworks collapses into government control

The UK's third-largest steelworks has been placed under government control, creating an uncertain future for nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. Insolvency courts granted a compulsory winding up order sought by creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds by Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) – part of the Liberty Steel metals empire of controversial tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. The company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, will now be placed in the hands of the official receiver - a government appointed liquidator - and special managers from consultancy firm Teneo. The government has agreed to cover the ongoing wages and costs of the plant while a buyer is sought. Following the High Court decision on Thursday, Liberty Steel's chief transformation officer Jeffrey Kabel told the BBC he was "really disappointed" as he thought they had "presented a very good case". "We are by far the best company to run this business. We've run it for 10 years. Put a lot of blood, sweat and a huge amount of money into it," he said. Lawyers for Mr Gupta had applied for a four-week adjournment for time to place the company in a "pre-pack administration", which allows an insolvent company to sell its assets to a bidder. He wanted funding from investment giant BlackRock and Fidera, which invests in distressed companies, to buy back the business. Winding up the company, his lawyers argued, could place the business in "free fall" and incur significant disruption, cost and risk to a nationally important steel company and its staff. The judge found the firm was "hopelessly insolvent" with £600,000 in the bank, a monthly wage bill of £3.7m, supported by a parent group that has 15 entities in insolvency proceedings across nine jurisdictions. Lawyer for the creditors, Ryan Perkins, argued UK steel-making would be better served if the company's assets were sold off with assistance from independent special managers acting on behalf of the government after it is wound up, rather than allowing administrators appointed by Mr Gupta to conduct the process. Liberty Steel Group's finances were upended when its main lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed owing billions to investors including UBS. Those investors are part of the creditor group that applied for the winding up petition. Mr Gupta's plan to place SSUK in administration then immediately buy it out again would have allowed the company to largely shed those debts. Mr Kabel said the company was still hopeful it could buy SSUK back due to Blackrock and others "supporting us". In court, creditors highlighted how SSUK had not published financial statements since 2019 and its direct parent company, based in Singapore, was itself subject to insolvency proceedings. The government will now be responsible for the operational and financial risks of the company, which has produced next to no steel for over a year. A spokesperson for the government said that it remains "committed to a bright and sustainable future" for steelmaking in the UK. In response to a question about British Steel in Scunthorpe, the first steel company the government seized control of in April, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Labour wanted to ensure the UK kept "primary steel making capacity here". "That's why the steel strategy alter on this year will set out the long term direction for the industry," she said. Speaking from outside the Sheffield site, mayor of South Yorkshire Oliver Coppard said it was "good news" the government had stepped in to take control and end the uncertainty for workers. But he told the BBC the government's next job is to ensure the steelworks now have "the brightest possible future". George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said there was a "strategic imperative" to produce steel in the UK, particularly for the defence industry. The court decision comes after the government took over day to day running of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant in April to prevent its Chinese owners from closing its steel furnaces. The entire industry has struggled with high energy prices, cheaper products from overseas and the blow to exports to the US caused by 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Following Thursday's court decision, the GMB union said it was "another tragedy for UK steel". Chris Williamson has worked at the Rotherham site for more than 25 years and is a union rep for Community union. He told the BBC the special managers had already arrived on site, and said the court's decision "puts a closure on things" but workers wanted "guarantees on pay and pensions". Mr Williamson said the Rotherham plant had not produced steel since July 2024, with most of the workers on a form of furlough, being paid 85% of their wages. "We just want certainty and to start producing steel again", he said. With additional reporting from Pritti Mistry and Ollie Smith Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: Bitcoin May Still Have Steam For $200,000 By End Of 2025, Anthony Scaramucci Forecasts

Amid all the turbulence in the crypto market lately, many crypto enthusiasts are keeping their eyes on the bigger picture. Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci sees Bitcoin reaching “between $180,000 and $200,000” by the end of 2025. Bitcoin’s price action has been anything but lackluster, as another wild 24-hour cycle brought traders on a roller coaster ride, with the foremost cryptocurrency falling a further 1.5%. BTC is currently down 9.3% from its early August all-time high of just over $124,000. During a recent interview with CNBC at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, Scaramucci, who is the founder and managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, described this as “a cautious price target.” He cited supply-and-demand dynamics as the main catalyst, stating that “there’s just way more demand than the issued supply of Bitcoin, or the existing overall supply in the marketplace.” “I just think it’s a function of buying and only 450 Bitcoin being made by the network per day,” the fund strategist posited. Scaramucci highlighted the soaring institutional adoption of Bitcoin over the past year, citing the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by asset managers like BlackRock and the increasing role of institutional participants. “If you went to a conference like this three years ago, it was mostly retail investors and CEOs working in the layer-one blockchain space,” he said. “Today, it’s lots more institutional investors.” Scaramucci expects much of this institutional investment to go into the ETFs rather than corporate Bitcoin investment vehicles such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy, a Nasdaq-listed company that popularized the BTC accumulation strategy. Scaramucci previously disclosed that he was the first external investor in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), prior to its approval in January 2024. According to him, JPMorgan will prefer to buy its Bitcoin via the IBIT as “it’s a very secure asset that people trust.” He called BlackRock’s industry-leading spot BTC ETF, the “purest link to Bitcoin.” It’s worth mentioning that Scaramucci isn’t the only uber-bullish expert in the cryptosphere. Earlier in July, British multinational bank Standard Chartered predicted a potential Bitcoin rocket rally to $200,000 by year-end.

Title: Mutual Funds Bleed Another $432B as ETF Conversions Grow

The number of mutual funds being converted into ETFs in 2025 has already topped 30, the most since 2021. August 21, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Mutual funds are bleeding assets anew, just as their ETF cousins break fresh records. Now, firms from Lazard to Aberdeen Group Plc. are pushing to convert traditional funds into exchange-traded ones, even as regulators look poised to bless a structure that would allow both to coexist in peace. The number of mutual funds being converted into ETFs in 2025 has already topped 30, on pace for the most in data going back to 2021, according to figures compiled by State Street, which counted conversions still in process. It comes even as the asset-management industry awaits a groundbreaking regulatory change that would allow firms to add an exchange-traded fund share class onto their existing mutual funds, arguably negating the need to go all-in on just one wrapper. In the meantime, money managers have forged forward with their conversion plans. In 2024, mutual funds bled a net $451 billion, while their exchange-traded counterparts — which typically offer superior tax efficiency and liquidity — took in a record $1.1 trillion, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. So far in 2025, mutual funds have already lost $432 billion. ETFs, meanwhile, have seen inflows of more than $670 billion so far in 2025.

Others have chosen not to wait for the regulatory approval of ETF share class,” said Koudelka, the firm’s global head of ETF solutions. More than 60 firms, including BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are waiting for the regulator to sign off on the so-called multi-share class structure, which was made possible after Vanguard Group’s exclusive patent on the fund design expired two years ago. The steady pace of conversions also underscores Wall Street’s growing preference to package strategies of all stripes into ETFs instead of mutual funds, as the latter vehicle has seen net outflows for the past three years.

Title: The ESG Bubble Is Bursting - Politicized investing has hurt America’s domestic energy production, economy, and national security.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/21/2025 7:32:29 AM PDT by MtnClimber The return of a pro-energy Republican to the White House has corresponded with the bursting of the “ESG” bubble. ESG stands for “environmental, social, and governance,” and ESG funds invest with those principles in mind, not merely to maximize shareholder returns. Through the first quarter of 2025, U.S. ESG funds have seen ten consecutive quarters of net capital outflows. That’s a promising start, but we need to stay vigilant—ESG activism reduces economic growth, shrinks our tax base, and weakens our national security. ESG funds do more than just invest in companies that meet environmental, social, and governance goals. They often strong-arm publicly traded corporations to subvert shareholder value in pursuit of nebulous concepts like sustainability, diversity, and “stakeholder” capitalism. Their goal is to effect social change outside the normal political process, one of several forms of policy adventurism I explore in my 2020 book, The Unelected: How an Unaccountable Elite Is Governing America.Though investors have always chosen to allocate their funds according to principles beyond just maximizing profit, the organized focus on ESG factors is of relatively recent provenance. The ESG moniker traces to late 2004, when the United Nations Global Compact released a report seeking to “connect” social policies with financial and corporate action. By 2006, the UN had cajoled various large financial institutions and stock markets into signing its “Principles for Responsible Investment.” By 2018, more than one-fourth of U.S. capital in professionally managed portfolios was under the ESG umbrella. Most investors intuitively understand that chasing priorities other than profit is likely to sacrifice returns over the long haul. But managers aggressively hawked ESG funds as a means of assuaging the guilty consciences of investors (who paid much higher fees in the bargain). Meantime, a confluence of factors created the temporary illusion that socially focused investors could have their cake and eat it too, enjoying both a clean conscience and healthy returns. A sustained period of easy credit from the 2008 financial crisis through the 2020 Covid pandemic masked ordinary economic incentives. New regulatory pressures driven by the Paris climate accords and other interventions created government-driven investment opportunities. Big technology companies’ stocks boomed. Though many of them had a voracious and growing appetite for energy, they happily signed on to ESG principles and were included in ESG funds. Then, at the height of the pandemic, demand for oil collapsed, along with its price, sending energy companies’ share prices downward. Once the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to temper post-Covid inflation, ESG investing strategies collapsed, and funds following them began to underperform the market in 2022 and 2023. To understand why, consider two energy firms that took radically different approaches to ESG activism. U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil largely resisted ESG mandates. British Petroleum, meantime, was an early adopter of ESG strategies, running advertising campaigns that rebranded its initials as “Beyond Petroleum.” After its Deepwater Horizon rig spilled massive quantities of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, it doubled its wager on this strategy and moved aggressively toward “net-zero” climate emissions goals. How have the two companies fared? From 2015 through 2025, Exxon has generated a 32.77 percent total return for its shareholders. Over the same period, BP has lost 24.03 percent of its value. This is not an isolated example. It’s therefore no surprise that, in 2022, global capital flows into ESG funds dropped from $649 billion in 2021 to $157 billion the following year. American investors, on net, pulled more than $40 billion out of ESG funds in 2022 and 2023, another $19.6 billion in 2024, and another $6.6 billion in 2025, through May. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a self-declared ESG leader, saw its 2022 net income drop by 12 percent, even as U.S. energy stocks surged. The ESG investing mania has largely subsided, but its legacy has been costly—and not only to Americans’ investment portfolios. As capital got diverted from profitable energy projects into “green” ventures with low returns and high political risk, drilling for new oil supplies slowed, refineries shuttered, and the United States remained vulnerable to global supply shocks. In 2023, the U.S. still imported 8.51 million barrels of oil per day. At an average price of $70 per barrel, that’s more than $217 billion in annual lost domestic energy value. Note that even modest increases in domestic oil supply could have a favorable macroeconomic impact. Studies suggest that for every $10 increase in the price per barrel of oil, GDP growth is reduced by 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. Higher energy prices hurt households, suppress economic activity, and widen our fiscal gap—all of which will increasingly matter as the nation grapples with a staggering $36 trillion national debt. Energy isn’t just about power and money—it’s about geopolitical influence, too. Reliable domestic energy supply is crucial for insulating us from Middle East instability, supply-chain disruptions, and growing competition with China. “Stakeholder capitalism” cannot fuel an industrial comeback or win a geopolitical arms race. Fortunately, the path back to sound policy is clear. Within days of taking office as Secretary of the Interior and head of the National Energy Dominance Council, Doug Burgum reopened federal land to drilling and launched a sweeping deregulation campaign to accelerate permitting for oil, gas, and critical minerals. Early this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees stock markets, reversed Biden-era guidance that gave ESG activists the agency’s imprimatur to coopt corporate annual meetings with social-policy concerns not materially related to companies’ bottom lines. But many of the policy shenanigans that buttressed the ESG investing boom remain in force. Among these are Biden-era Labor Department rules (set to be revised next year) that push retirees’ pension plans to invest in ESG vehicles. The SEC has also decided not to revisit Biden-era securities regulations that pressure firms to reorient their corporate governance around leftists’ climate-change concerns while litigation challenging those rules is pending. The ESG investing mania has subsided, but advocates for sound investing markets and energy policy have plenty of work left to do.

A sustained period of easy credit from the 2008 financial crisis through the 2020 Covid pandemic masked ordinary economic incentives. New regulatory pressures driven by the Paris climate accords and other interventions created government-driven investment opportunities. Big technology companies’ stocks boomed. Though many of them had a voracious and growing appetite for energy, they happily signed on to ESG principles and were included in ESG funds. Then, at the height of the pandemic, demand for oil collapsed, along with its price, sending energy companies’ share prices downward. Once the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to temper post-Covid inflation, ESG investing strategies collapsed, and funds following them began to underperform the market in 2022 and 2023. To understand why, consider two energy firms that took radically different approaches to ESG activism. U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil largely resisted ESG mandates. British Petroleum, meantime, was an early adopter of ESG strategies, running advertising campaigns that rebranded its initials as “Beyond Petroleum.” After its Deepwater Horizon rig spilled massive quantities of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, it doubled its wager on this strategy and moved aggressively toward “net-zero” climate emissions goals. How have the two companies fared? From 2015 through 2025, Exxon has generated a 32.77 percent total return for its shareholders. Over the same period, BP has lost 24.03 percent of its value. This is not an isolated example. It’s therefore no surprise that, in 2022, global capital flows into ESG funds dropped from $649 billion in 2021 to $157 billion the following year. American investors, on net, pulled more than $40 billion out of ESG funds in 2022 and 2023, another $19.6 billion in 2024, and another $6.6 billion in 2025, through May. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a self-declared ESG leader, saw its 2022 net income drop by 12 percent, even as U.S. energy stocks surged. The ESG investing mania has largely subsided, but its legacy has been costly—and not only to Americans’ investment portfolios. As capital got diverted from profitable energy projects into “green” ventures with low returns and high political risk, drilling for new oil supplies slowed, refineries shuttered, and the United States remained vulnerable to global supply shocks. In 2023, the U.S. still imported 8.51 million barrels of oil per day. At an average price of $70 per barrel, that’s more than $217 billion in annual lost domestic energy value. Note that even modest increases in domestic oil supply could have a favorable macroeconomic impact. Studies suggest that for every $10 increase in the price per barrel of oil, GDP growth is reduced by 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points.

American investors, on net, pulled more than $40 billion out of ESG funds in 2022 and 2023, another $19.6 billion in 2024, and another $6.6 billion in 2025, through May. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a self-declared ESG leader, saw its 2022 net income drop by 12 percent, even as U.S. energy stocks surged. The ESG investing mania has largely subsided, but its legacy has been costly—and not only to Americans’ investment portfolios. As capital got diverted from profitable energy projects into “green” ventures with low returns and high political risk, drilling for new oil supplies slowed, refineries shuttered, and the United States remained vulnerable to global supply shocks. In 2023, the U.S. still imported 8.51 million barrels of oil per day. At an average price of $70 per barrel, that’s more than $217 billion in annual lost domestic energy value. Note that even modest increases in domestic oil supply could have a favorable macroeconomic impact. Studies suggest that for every $10 increase in the price per barrel of oil, GDP growth is reduced by 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. Higher energy prices hurt households, suppress economic activity, and widen our fiscal gap—all of which will increasingly matter as the nation grapples with a staggering $36 trillion national debt. Energy isn’t just about power and money—it’s about geopolitical influence, too. Reliable domestic energy supply is crucial for insulating us from Middle East instability, supply-chain disruptions, and growing competition with China. “Stakeholder capitalism” cannot fuel an industrial comeback or win a geopolitical arms race. Fortunately, the path back to sound policy is clear. Within days of taking office as Secretary of the Interior and head of the National Energy Dominance Council, Doug Burgum reopened federal land to drilling and launched a sweeping deregulation campaign to accelerate permitting for oil, gas, and critical minerals. Early this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees stock markets, reversed Biden-era guidance that gave ESG activists the agency’s imprimatur to coopt corporate annual meetings with social-policy concerns not materially related to companies’ bottom lines. But many of the policy shenanigans that buttressed the ESG investing boom remain in force. Among these are Biden-era Labor Department rules (set to be revised next year) that push retirees’ pension plans to invest in ESG vehicles. The SEC has also decided not to revisit Biden-era securities regulations that pressure firms to reorient their corporate governance around leftists’ climate-change concerns while litigation challenging those rules is pending.

Title: Yieldstreet Losses Highlights the Potential Dangers of Private Investments
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/advisor/industry-news/yieldstreet-blowup-highlights-the-potential-dangers-of-private-investments/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T10:10:00Z

After several funds from the startup Yieldstreet resulted in total losses, experts questioned the role of private investments in client portfolios. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Real estate assets and other private investments have never been more accessible to clients. That might not be a good thing. The recent meltdown of the alternative asset manager Yieldstreet, four of whose real estate funds resulted in 100% losses for investors, according to CNBC, highlights the risks of bringing private investments to Main Street. (More than 20 other Yieldstreet funds are currently on a watchlist.) The losses come as an ongoing democratization of private markets — a $13 trillion industry expected to grow to $20 trillion by 2030, according to BlackRock — continues to make previously exclusive options available to average investors. President Donald Trump even signed an executive order earlier this month opening them to 401(k)s. But these investments come with potential risks. “Historically, this is part of the cycle of Main Street shunning the staid, the old, the used ideas,” said Alex Morris, the CEO of F/m Investments. “And Main Street, for a little while, loves it. Until there’s a blowup.” Private credit and alternatives-focused funds have grown in popularity of late, and one way asset managers bring these investments to retail investors is through ETFs. The index fund versions of these funds, which invest in assets including real estate, in the case of Yieldstreet, aren’t necessarily a bad bet — so long as investors take a “long-term view,” Morris said. “ETFs thrive on liquidity, so taking this inherently illiquid structure… and saying, ‘We’re going to mark this to market several thousand times a day,’ is a little peculiar,” he added. “They can’t go and make more houses in the same way you can with shares of SPY.” But although private credit and alternatives-focused ETFs have grown in popularity of late, some advisors remain wary. State Street’s private credit ETF, PRIV, has since grown to $145 million in assets, but it launched in February with just $50 million. Other funds capitalizing on the proliferation of private investments include: Used Goods. Another concern, particularly for pre-retirees, is ensuring portfolios liquidate evenly over time. “It’s unlikely someone constructing their own portfolio can solve the basic problem of timing their withdrawals to last their lifetime, much less creating an optimal portfolio from commercial products,” said Teresa Ghilarducci, an economist at The New School. “Even a target date fund with private equity will probably not be low-fee enough for an ordinary, single investor.” For Morris, the most troubling part is that exclusive deals usually remain exclusive. “Main Street is getting Wall Street’s recycled deals — the most mature, least alpha-generating ones,” he said. “They say that’s because they have less risk associated with them, but folks are generally not buying these because they want less risk… They’re buying because they want that alpha.” The development illustrates Vanguard’s ongoing dominance in ETFs as well as client demand for low-cost, passive strategies. Some praised the move while others said alts in employee-sponsored retirement plans conflict with fiduciary standards and can harm clients. The tech analyst said his taste in fashion mirrors his team’s out-of-the-box stock picking philosophy. There have been reports of advisors leaving, as well as a race among competitors for the industry talent that went up for grabs. The investor protection organization wants its advertising rules to align more closely with federal standards. Defined-outcome funds took in more than $8 billion during the first half of 2025. The industry is far from parity, but progress has been made over the past decade. Just like sports memorabilia and Pokémon cards, art is a risky venture that most clients probably shouldn’t touch. Experts said the GENIUS Act, signed into law this month, will make advisors more confident about getting into digital currencies. Finalized last summer, the proposal intends to address issues like terrorist financing and foreign corruption in America’s advisory industry. Golfing and camping topped the list, according to a recent AdvizorPro survey. The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: The UN-backed climate investors’ group that invested in... fossil fuels

Time Published: 2025-08-21T09:36:50Z
Full Content:
Despite having pledged to reach net-zero emissions, major members of Net Zero Asset Managers hold billions of dollars' worth of fossil-fuel stocks, including those in “carbon bomb” projects, while marketing their funds as green and sustainable. Select a language Fact check: In December 2020, a group of big players in international finance launched the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. They committed their firms to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. They planned to do this by directing investments toward sustainable businesses that are helping to cut the emissions responsible for the climate crisis. Context: Article 2c of the Paris Climate Agreement called for financial flows to be consistent with “a pathway towards greenhouse gas-emission-resilient development". Over 230 global banks and asset-management firms subsequently signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, launched in 2020 with the aim of “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or earlier”. Alas, those firms’ investments tell a different story. Launched in 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative committed its members to “supporting the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”. Over 230 firms signed up to it, including European ones such as Germany's DWS, the Netherlands' Robeco, France's AXA, and Italy's Eurizon. Some of these we have covered in previous reporting due to their ostensibly “green” investments in the fossil-fuel industry. NZAM carried the institutional imprimatur of the United Nations, in the form of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. UN PRI signatories commit, among other objectives, to incorporating “ESG [environmental, social and governance] issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes”. Specific ESG criteria are used to assess the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment. Net Zero Asset Managers has received significant media coverage, giving the impression that it is a force for change. In November 2022, for instance, the specialist magazine ESG Today headlined, “Net Zero Asset Managers reaches $66 trillion in assets under management”. The article explained that the signatories were committed to “progressively transforming their investment portfolios to align them with the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050". NZAM was covered on the UN's website in an April 2021 article titled “Biggest financial players back net zero”. NZAM's media profile has allowed its signatories to flaunt their commitment to the Paris climate accord and to market themselves as being mindful of sustainability. Yet our research shows that, at the high point of NZAM's activity in the last quarter of 2023, its members held the equivalent of $25 billion in fossil-fuel stocks in their “green” investment portfolios. Moreover, that sum included companies responsible for so-called “carbon bombs”, a term coined in 2022 by Kjell Kuhne, a campaigner at Leave it in the Ground (Lingo), to refer to hydrocarbons projects that generate more than one gigatonne of CO₂ over their lifetime. Specialists say that this type of project needs to be shuttered as quickly as possible if the Paris Agreement timetable is to be kept. Using data from the London Stock Exchange Data & Analytics, we identified funds classified as “green” under the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), in force since 2021. Articles 8 and 9 of the regulation govern the requirements to be met for marketing products as, respectively, having “environmental or social” objectives or being “sustainable investments”. The NZAM signatories that are most exposed to hydrocarbons accounted for 54 percent of all NZAM investments in this sector. They include DWS (a German firm), JP Morgan, BlackRock, Northern Trust and AllianceBernstein (all American), France's Amundi, the Netherlands' Robeco, Norway's Storebrand and Italy's Eurizon. Together they held a stake of just over $14 billion in the oil and gas industry. In 2023, many of these companies used terms such as “sustainability” and “innovation” to describe funds that held stakes in well-known oil giants. For example, the US firm State Street employed the words “Sustainable Climate” to market a fund that held a $7 million share in Exxon. Another fund, “Europe Climate Action”, marketed by Amundi, held $18 million of stakes in Aker, BP, Equinor, and TotalEnergies. In the past year, new guidelines have set clear limits on the use of sustainability-related words in the names of funds that invest in fossil fuels. However, as we showed in previous articles in this series, numerous asset managers continue to invest in dirty hydrocarbons while declaring their support for sustainability and ESG in their prospectuses to investors. Overall, of the ten NZAM members that have made the largest share of “green” investments, the stakes involved total $18 billion. They include 82 extraction projects defined as “carbon bombs” by Kjell Kuhne of Lingo. According to Kuhne, “the amount of emissions generated [by carbon bombs] is greater than that emitted in a year by the whole of Germany, a highly industrialized country that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels”. The investments made by the Net Zero Asset Managers have clearly not helped to convince their Big Oil beneficiaries to put a stop to these 82 “carbon bombs”. This despite the claim often made by asset managers that they can push the industry towards transition by means of their participation in company meetings and the votes they cast there. Furthermore, all ten firms mentioned are also signatories to the UN's Principles for Responsible Investment, despite continuing to invest in fossil fuels. In a report published in November 2024, the UN PRI Association writes that policymakers should instruct financial firms to implement “robust carbon pricing and market-based mechanisms, accelerating the full and equitable phase out of fossil-fuel subsidies and establishing clear plans and targets for phasing out unabated fossil fuels in line with credible 1.5°C pathways”. Kuhne, of Leave it in the Ground, is acerbic: ”These companies are actively creating these new CO2 bombs. When the climate is already in danger and spiraling out of control, not creating new carbon bombs should be the top priority." “A green investment should not provide any money to companies involved in the fossil-fuel supply chain“, he concludes. ”It should be ‘fossil-free’, and for me this is a fundamental criterion for being able to call oneself green, sustainable, and climate-friendly. Today, these companies are the biggest obstacle to progress towards sustainability. If you were selling a green fund while investing in Exxon, you were simply deceiving your customers."

Title: Private Equity In Your 401(k)? What Trump’s Order Opens—And Doesn’t
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/08/21/private-equity-in-your-401k-what-trumps-order-opens-and-doesnt/

ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” directing the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to explore ways to include private market investments and crypto in retirement plans. The order argues that American workers should have access to the same alternative investment opportunities long available to institutions and the wealthy. What what does this all mean for holding private equity in your 401(k)? With its bold framing, the order has already prompted some regulatory policy shifts. The SEC was asked to revisit accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules that currently limit retail participation. And indeed, earlier this week, the SEC issued guidance in ADI 2025-16 ending the 15% private investment limit in registered closed-end funds and related practices in place since 2002. The DOL, meanwhile, must reconsider past guidance on fiduciary duties under ERISA, including whether to establish safe harbors for fiduciaries who add private assets to 401(k) menus. The private equity (PE) industry has been preparing for this opening. With more than $12 trillion in defined-contribution retirement accounts, the 401(k) market is an enormous opportunity. And Trump’s executive order comes at a moment when private capital firms face a liquidity crunch: since 2018, capital calls have outpaced distributions by $1.5 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley. That imbalance is pushing managers to look toward retail dollars. Still, access is not the same as advantage. Ludovic Phalippou, professor at Oxford’s Said Business School, warns that private equity’s favored performance metric—the internal rate of return (IRR)—is a “mathematical artifact” that flatters results. If IRR claims were taken literally, he notes, modest 1970s funds would today be worth trillions—numbers that defy reality. Even when presented cleanly, PE performance may be more incremental than transformational. Of course, the time period of observation is key. Hamilton Lane, a leading private markets investor, calculates that $1 invested in private equity over the past decade would now be worth $3.96. That solid return edges out the S&P 500 ($3.51). Yet the gains come with trade-offs—illiquidity, opaque valuations, and higher fees—that can matter more to individuals than to large institutions. Diversification claims also deserve a second look. Private equity is still equity. While PE managers stress operational improvements and active ownership, today’s higher interest rates and thinner IPO pipelines expose the limits of the model. The easy returns of the 2010s may not repeat. Another hurdle lies in fiduciary duty. ERISA requires plan sponsors to act solely in the interests of participants, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits if high-fee, illiquid assets are added without clear justification. This litigation risk has kept most fiduciaries away from alternatives. As the Financial Times reported, firms like Apollo and BlackRock lobbied aggressively for the order, but ultimately the DOL—and the courts—will decide whether these products can withstand scrutiny. So the question lingers: will PE firms offer some of their best opportunities to retail investors—or their leftovers? Some skepticism is warranted, but there are already signs of good faith. Take KKR. The firm recently renegotiated terms with some institutional investors, increasing the carve-out share from the traditional 7.5% to as much as 20%. The change helps KKR deploy the increasing amounts of cash they are raising from individuals in perpetual vehicles. While controversial, the shift shows a willingness to integrate retail investors on a more equity footing. Even with such examples, executive action alone won’t deliver democratization. Regulators must craft rules that are protective yet practical--safe harbors for fiduciaries, updated investor eligibility standards, and far greater transparency on fees and liquidity. Private equity now faces a crossroads. It can broaden access responsibly, building trust with retail investors, or reinforce perceptions that it serves others first. For 401(k) plan sponsors and participants, the prudent course is cautious engagement—welcoming innovation in expansion of access to private markets while maintaining investor protections through disclosure and oversight. Access, after all, is not alignment. Done thoughtfully, private equity investment in 401(k)s provides broader investment solutions for retirement savers. Done poorly, it risks harming individuals and eroding confidence in the retirement system itself.

Title: Property prices rising 11 times faster than wages, with typical value now €370,000

Property prices rising much faster than wages Property prices are rising at multiples of the wage increases workers are receiving. Prices shot up by 8pc in the year to June, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). This means the typical, or median, price of a property is now €370,000, up €32,500 in a year. The increase is more than 11 times the amount by which average earnings rose in the last year, according to calculations by independent economist Austin Hughes. Wages increased by around €2,800. The CSO figures come on the back of a recent report from Daft.ie that found Irish house price inflation had reached a 10-year-high. June’s rise of 7.8pc is the same rate of property price inflation recorded in May. New supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases Mr Hughes said house price growth was now steady, but values were still increasing at a strong pace. He said rising employment and falling interest rates were sustaining affordability in the face of rising property prices. “Encouragingly, new supply appears to be at least limiting the pace of price increases,” he said. Sales of new homes were up 22pc in the first half of the year, while sales of second-hand properties were broadly flat. The June figures for the property price index from the CSO represent the 22nd month in a row in which prices have risen, putting the squeeze on first-time buyers and movers. Second-hand home prices are increasing at more than twice the rate of those of new homes. Today's News in 90 Seconds - August 21st A severe shortage of new properties to buy means many first-timers are bidding against those trading up and people who are moving. This is driving up second-hand prices. In the three-month period to June, new home prices were 4.2pc higher than in the same quarter last year, the CSO said. Prices of second-hand homes in the second quarter of this year were 8.8pc higher than in the corresponding quarter of 2024. Property prices in Dublin rose by 6.6pc in June, and those outside Dublin were up by 8.8pc compared with June last year. The median price of a dwelling bought in the 12 months to June was €370,000. The highest median price for a dwelling was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest was €190,000 in Leitrim. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to June was A94, which takes in Blackrock, Co Dublin. It had a median price of €780,000. The F45 Eircode, which takes in Castlerea in Co Roscommon, had the least expensive price of €148,000. In June, 4,029 dwelling purchases were filed with the Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.7bn. These comprised 3,092 existing dwellings and 937 new. Revenue data shows there were 1,531 first-time buyer purchases in June. The regions outside Dublin that recorded the largest growth in house prices were the west, comprising Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, at 10.3pc. The midlands recorded price growth of 10.2pc. At the other end of the scale, the south-east area that takes in Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford recorded a 7.1pc rise in house prices.

Title: Will Bitcoin Beat Every Asset Class? Bitwise Says Institutions Are Taking Notice
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-beat-every-asset-class-bitwise-institutions/
Time Published: 2025-08-21T03:00:43Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios is continuing to evolve, with new research from Bitwise Asset Management suggesting the asset could become the strongest-performing major investment class in the years ahead. According to a preview of the firm’s forthcoming Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs), Bitwise expects Bitcoin to deliver an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28% over the next 10 years while experiencing gradually declining volatility. The report, authored by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, frames Bitcoin not as an opportunistic play but as a maturing asset that is increasingly being considered a core portfolio component. Hougan noted that the launch and adoption of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a turning point, prompting large investment platforms and allocators to begin requesting long-term models for Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. Hougan explained that long-term capital market assumptions serve as the foundation for how major financial institutions design portfolios. Each year, firms like JPMorgan and BlackRock release detailed outlooks that guide asset allocation strategies. For the first time in 2025, professional investors have begun requesting that Bitcoin be included in these frameworks, with Bitwise reporting 12 such inquiries this year compared to none in previous years. “The fact that they’re now asking for long-term capital market assumptions means that they’ve shifted their view: It’s no longer a one-off for the fringes of the portfolio; it’s starting to be considered for the core,” Hougan said in the memo. He attributed this change to greater accessibility through regulated ETFs and approval by large account platforms managing trillions in client assets. Bitwise also emphasized that Bitcoin’s path toward institutional recognition has been gradual, requiring both regulatory clarity and infrastructure improvements. The launch of spot ETFs in January 2024 created a new on-ramp for traditional allocators, and subsequent approvals across national platforms have since accelerated the process. Hougan described the transition as occurring “brick by brick,” as Bitcoin gains a foothold in professional investment strategies. Looking ahead, Bitwise forecasts that BTC will not only outperform but stand apart from traditional assets in terms of expected returns. The firm projects a 28.3% CAGR over the next decade, significantly higher than the long-term expectations placed on equities, bonds, and private credit by leading Wall Street institutions. At the same time, while volatility is expected to remain elevated relative to other asset classes, Bitwise anticipates a steady decline as market depth expands and liquidity continues to improve. The implications of such a forecast extend beyond performance projections. A consistent inclusion of BTC in LTCMAs could formalize its role in balanced portfolios, shaping how pensions, endowments, and wealth managers approach diversification. Hougan cautioned that while risks remain, the framework is designed to give professional allocators a basis for strategic decision-making rather than a speculative outlook.

Title: Whales take $16 mln ETH to Bitcoin, yet Ethereum remains strong

Whales flee Ethereum for Bitcoin, but bullish ETH/BTC structure raises questions about altcoin season’s fate. Whales exited Ethereum, swapping $16 million for WBTC, while institutions withdrew $38 million in ETH. Retail holdings dropped, but ETH/BTC held 0.037 support. As the market underwent intense selling pressure, the largest capped cryptocurrency is emerging as the go-to safe haven. Whales and retail traders who panicked swapped Ethereum [ETH] for Bitcoin [BTC], while others closed leveraged trades at losses. Ethereum had outperformed BTC over the last three months. But was this the end of ETH’s relative strength? Some participants seemed to be accepting this as the end of ETH’s outperformance of BTC from their actions. One whale on Hyperliquid lost about $6.22 million in the crypto market crash. This trader had grown his starting capital of $125K to $7 million, with the peak at $43 million. The 4-month profits had been reduced to only $771K after liquidation. Per Lookonchain data, another whale swapped 3,900 ETH worth $16.26 million for 143.26 Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] at 0.03673, signaling capital rotation to BTC. Source: Lookonchain Historically, an ETH/BTC dump coupled with capital rotation has preluded the end of the altcoin season. So, will the narrative hold now? The ETH/BTC ratio held firm at 0.037, above support at 0.033. Its recent peak at 0.039 suggested momentum toward 0.040. Naturally, this pullback could explain liquidations and capital shifts. Yet, the pair has carved higher highs since April’s 0.025 low, keeping the structure bullish. Source: TradingView Anyway, institutional activities on the network and views of legendary traders suggested that the altcoin season was not yet over. Of importance, BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale sold Ethereum on Coinbase as per Arkham. This ended their buying streak that started in early this year and intensified in April. The institutions usually sell their tokens at higher levels, prices crash, and then they go long at a cheaper cost. This usually shakes out weak hands. Supporting this intentional manipulation of price was the fact that other institutions were buying. Two institutional addresses withdrew $38 million in ETH from FalconX. CryptoQuant data added nuance. Retail holdings plunged to 8.6 million ETH, while large investors climbed to 10.8 million ETH. Source: CryptoGoos/X The institutional sell-off urged caution. However, confirmation of a cycle break requires ETH to lose bullish structure on higher timeframes.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Quadrant Tony Thomas Australian schools are about to ramp up Net Zero campaigning using the latest movie “Future Council” from dark-green activist Damon Gameau. I’m predicting this with confidence because teachers have drenched more than a million kids from primary classes upwards with Gameau’s previous movie/docos 2040 (2019) and Regenerating Australia (2022). All-up his offerings (at last week) have got to 1,534,783 kids and launched about 50,000 largely school-based “action plans”. How does Gameau, 43, an ex-actor turned producer, achieve his startling reach into classrooms? It’s because all his far-left and environmental causes are taken up by Cool.org. Cool then delivers them as time-saving online lessons to Australia’s eager teachers. I’ve been tracking Cool.org as a cuckoo-in-the-school-nest for a decade, here, here, here, here and here. Formerly Cool Australia, it claims teachers now deliver its all-topics material to 2.5 million schoolkids a year and have reached 92% of schools. The lesson kits are expertly mapped to the curriculum and fulfil the cross-curriculum priority of “sustainability.”[1] As for promoting Gameau, Cool today offers teachers about 35 different lessons on his 2040 movie, and at least seven lessons on Regenerating Australia (37,000 students and 2637 Action Plans). The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner. That includes replacement of capitalism with UK ‘renegade economist’ Kate Raworth’s vision of a “doughnut [circular] economy”. Regenerating Australia likewise is set in 2029, looking back at a decade “that saw Australia transition to a fairer, cleaner, more regenerative economy that values Australia’s greatest assets – First Nations’ wisdom, our unique natural environment and our sense of community.”Now stand by for Future Council’s blitz into classrooms. Gameau spent last month on live Q&A’s at national pre-releases, and launched it officially on August 7. I took in his “inspiring and rollicking journey” at Yarraville’s olde-world Sun Theatre, along with 150 adoring parents and kids. It’s Gameau’s most ambitious venture yet and the audience, already green converts, went wild. Gameau and singer Ruby Rodgers from the film (she’s 15) took questions. Note this Feedback from previews: ♦ nichollerussell: “I can’t wait to see it tonight, I’m bringing my 2 classes or 42 students who are in year 3/4.” ♦ “There’s a lot of darkness in the world right now but holy smokes, @future__council is pure light.” ♦ “I cried through most of the doco. Our natural world is breathtaking, so full of wonder, and these kids remind us just how easy it is to forget that. They are rightfully scared about the future and angry at us adults for not doing enough to ensure their future … If we’re willing to listen, they might just show us the way.” ♦ “Damon Gameau, you’ve done it again. Another film that knocked me off my feet yet left me feeling stronger, more hopeful, and more determined to fight for this planet and all who call it home.”Gameau did a global casting call two years back for kids aged 10-14 to star in a road-trip movie traversing eight countries in western Europe in a cute yellow bus. The kids’ brief was to harangue corporate chiefs about emissions and plastic litter. From 1300 applicants, Gameau selected a diverse group of eight, based on their climate-warrior ethos, perkiness and affinity for show biz. Gameau emphasises that his bus ran on planet-friendly vegetable oil. He doesn’t mention the emissions from air-ferrying kids, plus a parent or guardian, to Europe. They came from places afar as Australia, Norfolk Island, Bali, Singapore and Uganda. As if the kids aren’t already brainwashed, he gets high-profile activists to gee them up. His theme is that school strikes haven’t saved the planet, and kids are looking for practical ways to rescue their future and work off their climate angst. The film is his marketing vehicle for his real-world Future Councils of kids, mostly schools-based. He aims to set up them here and worldwide as advisory boards to help reform back-sliding corporates. To make his bus trip look worthwhile, he has to big-up the so-called “climate crisis”. And here’s the rub: the poor little mites are traumatised by climate doom. Sure there’s a happy ending and the kids end the trip full of false hopes. That’s in line with psychs’ advice to scare them into activism, but not enough to paralyse them. Perhaps a bit sadistic? Other reviewers, all but one, gloss over this issue. The exception is James Joyce, executive editor of Australian Community Media and ex-editor of the Canberra Times, who I found in North West Star (paywalled, sadly). Joyce, apparently acquiescent in net-zero, still does a deadly interview of Gameau. Joyce: I started off feeling quite angry about what you were doing to these kids. I felt upset for them – that they were being asked to take all this on when they are just kids. By the end, there is some hope, inspiration, ideas and energy, which is great. But my first question is, are the kids alright? Gameau replied that the kids are not OK because we’re not doing anywhere near enough. They’re the generation that has to live in a polluted world and the point of the film is to let their voices be heard. “We don’t want these children to have to understand the complexities of the system and geopolitics,” he replies. “What the children bring is this refreshing creativity, they also bring a bloody morality that’s really missing from the system right now.” He said many leaders and big corporations are acting like psychopaths because that’s what the system allows: short-term thinking and maximum extraction. “And the children get to say ‘Hang on, where’s the humanity in all this?” Joyce: Are you saying that it’s fantasy or defensive or denial from grown-ups to say: ‘Can the kids just please be allowed to be kids? Can’t they have their childhood and not have to worry about this stuff until maybe they have actual agency in their lives?’ Instead of being in tears at age 10, don’t they deserve their innocence, their chance to not have to worry? Gameau said the crying 10-year-old in the film was actually frustrated by cleaning up beach plastic every weekend “and no one in her government or community is giving a shit like she does and she doesn’t understand”. (Gameau did not mention the film’s other kids who were depressed and pessimistic about a planetary apocalypse foisted on them by the climate crowd). Gameau said he still speaks to the kids most weeks and they’re all doing well. None are obsessed with trying to fix the planet themselves. They’ve got lots of other interests. “But I’m with you. I think, gosh, it’d be great if kids didn’t have to go through this.” Joyce: But my heart breaks for Skye [Welsh, about 12], who is so angry. At her age, doesn’t she deserve to not have that anger? Gameau: Yeah, you’re right. She does. But she’s in a village, Fairbourne, that’s about to go under the water – the first one in the Western world because of climate.” He said it’s so real to her because she’s losing her home and getting fire in her belly over it. “We can’t ask her just to stop because she’s fighting for something bigger than we understand. (Fairbourne’s watery grave by 2050 is just more worst-case climate baloney dished out by a green-left town council scared of lawsuits, and contrary to views of eminent scientists in those parts. Don’t take my word for it, it’s all spelt out in the local Cambrian News.) Joyce: But when [Qld-born eco-activist] Clover Hogan tells the kids “eco-anxiety is a really healthy response” – that stabbed me. Is it healthy for a 10-year-old? Gameau: If you’re not feeling some kind of emotion, where are you at? How disconnected are you actually with the living world? Let’s have a proper conversation because children are feeling things more deeply than maybe a few more adults should be. Joyce: There’s an impulse to say ‘Just leave the kids alone, let them be kids, stop turning them all into Greta Thunberg’. I think we’d prefer for our kids to be like the boy from Norfolk Island [called Hiva] who just cherishes birds and wants to take photos of them. Gameau: The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. So, perhaps the Greta [Thunberg] bolshie approach isn’t actually the only way to do this… We have to do things differently.As for the film itself, it opens with a glum Joaquin (from Holland), who looks about 12-14. He was born deaf but after a Cochlear implant can now speak several languages. He says, “I just hear nothing else, like complete death. When I think about the future, it’s not good. Yeah, it’s looking pretty dark. Companies not even trying to care about the planet. You know, I’m trying to live here too.” Whichever adults dumped their climate paranoia on this kid should examine their consciences. Gameau: Why do you all think that we’ve started this trip in a forest? Joaquin: So we can see what would be lost if humanity continues like this. Gameau: Very good answer. Soon after, Aurvi, 11, from Singapore, says she wouldn’t even in her thoughts think of hurting someone. But she visited the Great Barrier Reef and all the beautiful corals and fish and turtles could one day be gone. (Again, climate zealots have blighted her joy by doom-mongering about the Reef. Just last month the Institute of Marine Science’s annual reef data showed coral cover at record highs for the past several years, recently returning to about the 40-year average – despite six supposedly cataclysmic bleachings in the past decade).[2] Skye from Wales wrote to nature guru David Attenborough: I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood. As mentioned, this derives just from town councillors and activists doom-crying on their concocted worse-case scenarios. Bird-loving boy Hiva from Norfolk Island seems as dejected as Skye. He says birds are the ambassadors for wild places. Then he found out about critically endangered, vulnerable birds. “I could bring back a book in 30 years’ time about the extinct birds of the world and then I could have to write a sad introduction about all the things that people have done. I love them so much and I want them to be here no matter what.” He would try to see less money going to the companies that destroy and really hurt birds. The omission here is what suggests Gameau’s film is indoctrination not education. Why does Gameau not draw attention to the raptor-mincing ways of the wind turbines that he’d love to see dotting entire landscapes? There’s no wind turbines (yet) on Hiva’s Norfolk Island, but surely the kids on the bus notice a few during their trip through eight countries, and raise the bird issue? Ruby Rodgers, from NSW, is the granddaughter of rocker Jimmy Barnes and her singing is often on the film’s soundtrack. She says, “How we are treating the planet right now, and humanity, is quite scary.” Lines in the soundtrack from her songs include, “How can you tell me to keep on breathing? Tell me to keep believing while my home is being torn apart? Try not to give up, try to make a stand, ‘Coz I feel my future, Slippin’ from my hands.”Gameau’s film wheels out “experts” to calm the kids’ fears, like North-Queensland-born UK climate activist and Al Gore disciple Clover Hogan, now 24. At 16 she attended the UN’s Paris climate conference and at 19 she set up her “Force of Nature” entity to ally youngsters with decision-makers and jointly tackle the “climate deniers”.[3] Via google I find she touts the gamut of green-left causes like anti-capitalism and open borders. To Hogan, a UK government decision to open 42 new oilfields is “a death sentence” for her generation. And she wants the media to stop asking mean questions about activists’ “hypocritical” air travel, and instead “challenge the rich and powerful”. In the film one of the girls, about 14, asks her, “Like I’m not doing as much as everyone else and I just feel like there is so much pressure. It’s like, ‘Be doing more!’” But she doesn’t know what to do, and her voice cracks with emotion. Clover tells her she is already doing so much. The sadness, anger, frustration is the internal alarm bell that something is really wrong, although people in power try to numb such feelings. “So eco-anxiety is a really healthy response, right? It is evidence that you care.” Hogan thus calms the girl, who wipes away a tear. Marketing the film, Gameau over-sells how the kids confront corporate chiefs, because the only big companies that agreed to be censured by sub-teen greenies were Nestle and ING Bank, plus an online session with sportwear’s Decathlon. ING was in the tent already, having banned lending to coal companies and similar CO2 villains. The others, especially Coca-Cola and Pepsi, wisely turned down this alleged opportunity. Note that Gameau’s film continually mixes up the valid case against plastic litter, with net-zero agitation and foolish denunciation of “plastics” per se, vital ingredients of modern living. Given the kids’ scripted questions, the execs were on a hiding to nothing: ♦ When your grandchildren grow up, do you think they’ll be proud that you helped finance global pollution? ♦ Why not try to sacrifice a tiny bit of the profits in exchange for long-term sustainability? ♦ What are you and your foundation doing to ensure climate justice? ♦ What would you prefer: to have a greener future, or to have a future that still has fossil fuels and bad gasses? I don’t want to knock any kid’s sincerity and passion but it’s Gameau, not me, setting them up for crusading to classrooms. And the kids’ parent or guardian who came along for the ride were fine with their kids fronting Gameau’s polemic. The kids’ tussle with Nestle’s PR global chief Rob Cameron in Switzerland is the film’s climax, supposedly illustrating Gameau’s “Future Council” of wise and righteous adolescents. I can see how Nestle’s Cameron got seduced in. He’s been a green activist for 25 years and joined Nestle in 2020 from his CEO and managing partner role at global think tank SustainAbility. He runs Nestle’s ESG (‘environment, social, governance’) efforts and helps run its Net Zero Roadmap. About the time when Gameau’s troop monstered him, he became chair of the International Chamber of Commerce’s Global Commission on Environment and Energy. The kids, doubtless geed-up by their adults, saw him as the culprit for plastic litter. Relaxed in his open-neck sky-blue shirt, he tried to explain that without high-tech packaging, Nestle foods would degrade, especially ageing on small-shop shelves in the tropics. He hinted that green-friendly packs might let in human-unfriendly bugs. Skye from Wales, congratulated later by Gameau for her ‘bad-ass’ speeches, was having have none of it. Channelling Greta Thunberg’s ‘How dare you!’, she read from her script: I sat in front of a powerful leader and listened to your empty words and empty promises. Plastic is everywhere. It’s in our seas and our rivers, on our beaches and mountains, in our food and even in our blood. They proudly tell us that Smarties can be a completely sustainable paper tube, whilst you churn out over five billion plastic wrapped KitKats every single year. You’re the third biggest polluter on the planet. You are not a powerful leader. You are a disgrace. She finished with a Thunberg-like glower and then a little grin, while Gameau’s score swells and he inserts a clip of Skye collecting plastic litter to show she’s a good kid. Serves silly Cameron right for trusting the movie project in the first place. The lamestream-media reviews rhapsodise about Skye leaving Cameron “speechless”. In fact he recovered swiftly from brat-attack and his response was a model of kindness: Sorry you think that. Truly. You’re right that the company has a lot of impact. And when it comes to great responsibility, I and other folk in the business all care passionately about the world we live in. I’m a father. We love our children. I don’t want to leave a [worse] world that my daughter grows up in. Companies [should] operate in an economy that knows its place within the wider ecosystem, we just lost sight of that. Not all the film’s humour seems intentional – one of the boys says, “A lot of the time kids aren’t listened to by adults. I’ve had some really good ideas for them. It was more about my bedroom, but…” Future Council , although days old, has already aged badly. The Net Zero quest is collapsing.[4] China, India and the US have opted out and Western Europe is convulsed with doubts, not that teachers would ever let kids know. Once-green asset managers like BlackRock ($US10 trillion) and Vanguard ($US9 trillion) have quit the Net Zero club to realign with fossil fuels. BP has ditched the revised branding and renewables theme from 2000, namely “Beyond Petroleum”. The re-brand supported renewables but has trashed BP’s share price. Facts and brainwashing aside, Gameau’s movie has plenty of charm with its exuberant storyline, family-friendly antics and great production values. Gameau has even allocated 75% of his producer’s profit share to the Future Council concept. For all that, the movie has arisen from the ideological swamp to the left of the Greens, as evident in Gameau’s political musings on his Instagram posts. When (not if) this movie invades classrooms, conservative parents need to start their own climate protesting. Tony Thomas’s latest book, Anthem of the Unwoke – Yep the other lot’s gone bonkers is available from Connor Court, $34.95 [1] Jason Kimberley of the Craig Kimberley rich-list family launched Cool in 2008. [2] AIMS for alarmism’s sake takes pains not to show the GBR’s total recent coral cover, instead splitting it into separate graphs for the northern, central and southern reefs. Dr Peter Ridd has simply combined the data as shown here to reveal the reef’s true health. [3] Clover Hogan was shocked to be invited to discuss “climate science” on a TV show, but “sharing the segment with a climate denier.” She upbraided the producer, who replied that since people like President Trump denied the science, the media had to reflect all views. Clover’s view was that the media should tell only “the truth” – adding, “Lives, policies, and the future of the planet depend on it.” [4] As the International Energy Agency puts it, “Despite efforts to reduce these emissions, the trajectory of CO2 emissions globally remains far higher than what is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

But we do have “Freedom of Speech” which allows you to say stupid (but not intentionally harmful) things. (I’m looking at you Al Gore and Micky Mann.) I will argue what Al Gore is preaching is religion, not science. I also posted a negative comment about AG in this thread. Inconvenient truth etc are truly shameful. But man, what a great growly oratory voice he has. Gore failed out of divinity school. But he does have that camp meeting aura. If I can’t cast (rhetorical) stones at evil, then how will the good be defended? Hey teacher! Leave those kids alone! The trouble is, they’re not just another brick in their walls, more of an RSJ… My thought exactly!! Thank goodness I grew up before climate even existed. The first I heard of climate in the classroom was when I was in college. Then it was that we were heading into an ice age. Ah, for the good old days. My indoctrination was a luncheon speech in 2021 to a group of us retired managers by an Emeritus polymath professor from the University of Rochester, who to keep busy in his retirement was helping his friend Richard Lindzen of MIT analyze data concerning the alleged Global Warming crisis. Without going into any detail, what got me hooked was his clear demonstration of the logic chain (with probabilities) you would have to accept in order to believe we were facing a crisis. My next steps were WUWT and Bishop Hill. No turning back after that. Bishop Hill? WUWT? Bishop Hill – long dead UK sceptic blog WUWT – abbreviation for… look at the top of the page, If you want to get some real info to chew on, try Steve McIntyre’s “Climate Audit” blog. He was upfront and center during the Climategate scandals. Bishop Hill was kept by Andrew Montford, who went on to write the excellent ‘The Hockey Stick Illusion’, and is now (IIRC) in charge of the think tank founded by the late Nigel Lawson, The Global Warming Policy Foundation. Bishop Hill, and then the GWPF and offshoots, have performed in the UK something like the role performed by WUWT in the States. It’s astounding. College students were required to read “Population Bomb” when it came out. Again… environmental science and ecology majors should be required to read the original edition _today_. Lots of YouTube videos now about the horror of population collapse. That, and the horror of AI destroying all middle class jobs. Apparently, people always need something to fear and that allows grifters to exploit that potential for fear. The kids in the film do come to realise that there are some really good humans who care about the planet and who have children and who are working in these massive corporations. There are “some,” he says. Yes, and there are some who use their children as props for their own politics. Hopefully these children will gain balanced and productive thinking from mentors they will have later in life. For others it will be too little too late probably. Or they will find mentors who make things worse. I think real data will confirm that there are a LOT of “good humans” who “care about the planet” while rejecting the assumptions and solutions alarmist preach. What I don’t understand is that most people don’t realize that if you accept someone’s false (and undefined) PREMISE on faith, they then can get you to accept any ridiculous CONCLUSION. ...”live in a polluted world” – what pollution, and once you define what “pollution” you are talking about, where do I go for data to confirm your allegation?!? Until then, stop preaching about solutions to your imaginary problems. (I’m too busy preparing for the imminent invasion of leprechauns to the US!) “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” – Voltaire This is child abuse. Nothing less. You took the words right out of my mouth Useful idiots doing the Marxists bidding. The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. “Conspiracy theory”? Bit by bit, inch by inch, they are introducing their ideology without showing their faces. Do they even teach anymore that without CO2 we wouldn’t have any plants growing and producing food to eat and oxygen for us to breath? The Marxists are playing the long game and now starting with indoctrinating our children. __________________________________________________________________________ NOW?? They’ve been at for as long as I can remember, and I have a 1944 DOB. Yup. I can attest that the process started before USA HS class of 1992. I was wondering … will this turn out to be a product by a raging alcoholic’s fever dream like the 2004 movie by Morgan Spurlock who turned out a docudrama called “Super Size Me” wherein practically everything in the movie was/is a lie? Notable are the comments (in the video below) from people (kids in school at the time) who saw Super Size Me at their schools (in 2004) and called out their teachers for the ridiculous premise Spurlock based the film on -the over eating of jumbo portions of fast food- and the effects on his body which INCLUDED (but not revealed in the film) his alcoholism (which was only admitted-to years later by Spurlock.) Kids are not always so easily fooled it seems. Maybe that will happen with this effort too (a revelation years after the film is out and the kids will toss out the premise.) Supersize Me: How Documentaries Lie But, but, but… You can’t be saying that someone as altruistic as Al Gore would lie to us, can you…? The smart ones will “get it”. They have instilled indoctrination into the schools crowding out some of the needed reading, writing, arithmetic studies. It is a nation in decline. I wonder if this Gameau dude is going to take his act to Chinese schools, noting that they are the biggest emitter? I suspect not. I think in almost all countries where there is an education establishment, it’s leftist. And although the left does not believe in God, they have taken at least some of the wisdom in the Bible to heart, applying propaganda and indoctrination from an early age: Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. — Proverbs 22:6 Not sure what you mean by leftist, but in western countries the educational establishment was the Church. And, following the French example, the reaction to the Church was the alternative educational establishment. As the State and RC Churches are defenders of orthodoxy, conservative power structures and the Establishment, the alternative has been leftist. Because they are the reaction to reactionary forces. The thing to do is mount an organization to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. Adults who lie to kids for their own self-serving feelings of virtue. Net Zero as an expression of defective personalities. The whole green thing is clearly powered by character assassination. Time to do some character assassination right back. HEAR HEAR! to show the kids they’ve been scammed by narcissistic adults. They’re already predisposed to think that, might actually accomplish something! “…dark-green activist Damon Gameau.” A good fit for the title role — Here follows a marvellous wonder, which transpired in the town of Hamelin in the diocese of Minden, in this Year of Our Lord, 1284, on the Feast of Saints John and Paul. A certain young man thirty years of age, handsome and well-dressed, so that all who saw him admired him because of his appearance, crossed the bridges and entered the town by the West Gate. He then began to play all through the town a silver pipe of the most magnificent sort. All the children who heard his pipe, in the number of 130, followed him to the East Gate and out of the town to the so-called execution place or Calvary. There they proceeded to vanish, so that no trace of them could be found. The mothers of the children ran from town to town, but they found nothing. It is written: A voice was heard from on high, and a mother was bewailing her son. And as one counts the years according to the Year of Our Lord or according to the first, second or third year of an anniversary, so do the people in Hamelin reckon the years after the departure and disappearance of their children. This report I found in an old book. And the mother of the Dean Johann von Lüde saw the children depart. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin TL;DR Learn to read faster. “The plot of Gameau’s 2040 is set in a future where renewables triumph over fossil fuels, vegans thrive, and every green brain-snap has proved a winner.” 2040-2025 = 15 years “The average retirement age for Australian teachers is around 65 years old, according to NGS Super” If I were king of Australia I would demand that any teacher who shows this movie before 2030 must also show the same, unupdated, unedited film after 2040 lest their retirement funds become void. The second biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth was its popularity as USA science class filler the year it was released. The first biggest tragedy of Gore’s Inconvenient Truth is that it is not shown in the same classes today in unupdated, unedited form – the smart kids will “get it”. I believe it is a UK requirement that that piece of rubbish can only be shown in schools if preceded by a clear statement that everything in that film has been proven false. I agree wholeheartedly that we should embrace First Nations wisdom, especially that of the European First Nations who ushered in the age of enlightenment and allow humanity to grow out of superstitious belief systems empowering humanity to grow, nurture and shepherd the planet to support ~10 Billion humans and incredible biodiversity that exists. So, lets embrace the wisdom of the European First Nations people(s). Well expressed and dead on. Three full cheers for the Enlightenment! The problem, on all sides of all political debates, is that there is no risk management. In the real world, wherever accountable decisions are made, every choice must also consider what happens if the decision is not made or if it is made… and goes wrong. The probabilities are assessed and justified, the mitigating precautions are put in place (considering costs relative to the probabilities). And then, only then, is the decision made. In politics, the decision is made assuming that they have the absolute truth of the world; now, yesterday and forever. (Theologically speaking, this is warned against in the 1st Commandment. There is a reason it’s the very 1st one). “I’m 12 years old and I live very near the village of Fairbourne, destined to become the first climate refugees of the developed world. The entire village is built on a flood plain and due to rising sea levels, by 2050 it is due to completely flood.” No, Fairbourne is built on the medieval seabed. The A493 road follows the original coastline approximately 10m above high-water mark. The land now occupied by the village of Fairbourne, now in the county of Gwynedd but once part of the historic county of Merioneth, was until the mid 1800’s nothing more than a mixture of open rough grazing and salt marsh. The church & hotel occupy the only stable ground in Fairbourne, a holiday village built in the 1860s enabled by the coming of the railway. The land that comprises Fairbourne and lower Friog was formed by glacial deposits and built up sand deposited by tidal action. This ‘Northwards Longshore Drift’ over thousands of years built up the shingle bank that stretched from the Friog cliffs in the South across the front of Fairbourne, ending in a sand spit opposite Abermaw (Barmouth) on the shores of the Mawddach estuary. These same tidal conditions regularly shift stone and sand around and are responsible in part for the silting up of Abermaw (Barmouth) harbour and the mouth of the Mawddach. Further up the coast, Harlech Castle (1288), was built on the coast with a dock for supplies. Since then, Northwards ‘Longshore Drift’ has moved the coast ~ 1kM to the west ( a lot of the material coming up from Fairbourne). Harlech railway station is built on the old seabed next to the (now dry) castle dock, and like at Fairborne, the A493 road follows the original coastline. Here endeth the lesson (:-)) Error, … plus pics “and like at Fairborne, the A493 B4573 road follows the original coastline.” Sorry (:-(( Picture shows Harlech Castle dock at the rail/road crossing (bottom left) & the old coastline curving away (mid right). &f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d4701f35aebcd5ac7d5d3f5de9b9c73bab8aebfca41a7bd374a57c62e3478704 *** Fairborne, the old coastline is at the dark tree line, other side of the railway embankment. https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%2Fid%2FOIP.KrYS0ztadqsY4jKRn_11ywHaEI%3Fr%3D0%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=0ce68450207e4d5a6f0775bd81ac777d4592776123ceac52f226e5cb8fbbc733 Being taught what to think though emotionalism.

Title: 5 bold crypto predictions for 2026
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/5-bold-crypto-predictions-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T19:00:55Z
Full Content:
From Bitcoin milestones to DeFi growth, here are five bold predictions outlining crypto’s possible trajectory in 2026. Bitcoin could approach $198K, Ripple nears a $125 million settlement, and Ethereum eyes $15K. Memecoin ETFs loom and DeFi adoption accelerates, making 2026 a pivotal year across multiple sectors. In 2025, crypto markets exploded, with total market cap exceeding $4 trillion. Despite economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and regulatory concerns, crypto proved more entrenched than ever. Over the past seven months, institutional demand for cryptocurrency surged. Bitcoin [BTC] stabilized above $100k. Moreover, crypto-friendly policies and regulatory frameworks slowly emerged in the U.S. since the Election of Donald Trump. But what should we expect in 2026? Since dropping to a low of $74k four months ago, Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high of $124,517. It stabilized above $100k and has held it for over 60 days. Significantly, this uptrend was fueled by institutional demand and capital inflows through ETFs. Bitcoin’s Spot ETFs’ Total Net Assets hit approximately $150 billion, indicating massive demand. Source: CoinGlass Amid steady inflows, Bitcoin’s bull cycle may prove extended and exhausting. In such a case, based on the long-term power law, Bitcoin might reach $130k in September 2025 and close the year at $141.9k. Source: Bitbo In 2026, if institutional demand remains constant and macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, Bitcoin could peak at $198k. In the most bullish scenario, if BTC continues to rise at the same rate as it has over the past year, it might reach $211k. Ripple [XRP] became the breakout altcoin of 2025. Over the year, XRP soared ~620%, climbing from $0.50 to $3.60. Having said that, the surge was linked to U.S. regulatory shifts. Since 2018, the SEC had waged war on Ripple, eroding investor confidence. Source: X Now, with policy changes, Ripple’s battles appear near conclusion. Brad Garlinghouse confirmed the SEC would drop its case, while Ripple agreed to pay a $125 million fine after Judge Torres rejected a $50 million reduction. This resolution sets a precedent for future crypto cases and opens doors for institutional adoption, especially in cross-border settlement. If $5 breaks in 2025, XRP could rally toward $10 in 2026. While Bitcoin and XRP rallied at the start of 2025, Ethereum [ETH] plummeted, especially over Vitalik Buterin’s political stands. Yet institutions, whales, and ETFs returned strongly in recent months. At press time, Spot ETH ETFs managed ~$22 billion in assets. Also, ETH has become an institution’s favorite with Bitmine, Sharplink, and BlackRock aggressively accumulating it. In this case, we expect institutions and ETFs to push Ethereum to rally into a new all-time high. As such, ETH could retest $5K in September, climb to $8K by year-end, and average $9K–$10K through 2026. A cycle peak near $15K remains possible. This price uptick will be primarily driven by upgraded network and staking scarcity. As such, we expect the layer 2s of Ethereum to improve transactions and reduce costs, thereby making the blockchain dominant. Memecoins, especially Dogecoin [DOGE], have had a dismal performance in 2025 so far. The Official Trump [TRUMP] hype quickly dissipated once it emerged. This is because capital has massively rotated to Bitcoin, XRP and ETH. However, this doesn’t mean all is lost. Like other coins, market players have pushed for a memecoin ETF. As such, Grayscale and Bitwise applied for Dogecoin ETFs, while Canary Capital applied for Pudgy Penguins [PENGU] ETFs. In 2026, approval of a Dogecoin ETF or another memecoin could trigger fresh speculative frenzy. Amid a growing cryptocurrency market, adoption and growing support from major economies such as the United States, DeFi becomes closer to the everyday consumer. For that reason, it’s natural to expect traditional CeFi pools to integrate with DeFi, expanding borrowing, lending, and yield functionalities. Source: Grandview Therefore, in 2026, we expect the DeFi market to grow from its current $21 billion and surpass $30 billion. This will push the long-term projection towards $231 billion into reality as DeFi integrates growing AI. Looking at previous cycles, the crypto market continued to grow over the past decade with minimal drawdowns. Now, with a $4T market cap, crypto stands among the world’s top asset classes. And in 2026, the growth will continue not only for Bitcoin, but also for other altcoins and the broader blockchain ecosystems. As a result, the total market cap of cryptocurrencies will most likely reach $5 trillion and flip, becoming among the top global economies.

Title: Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin as best-performing asset over next decade
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitwise-forecasts-bitcoin-as-best-performing-asset-over-next-decade/
Time Published: 2025-08-20T18:42:46Z
Full Content:
Bitwise Asset Management expects bitcoin to deliver the strongest returns of any major asset class over the next ten years, projecting a compound annual growth rate of 28% with gradually declining volatility. The forecast was shared in a new memo previewing the firm’s forthcoming Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report. The report, authored by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, is targeted at large platforms and professional allocators that are increasingly treating bitcoin as a “core” portfolio consideration. Hougan notes that the shift follows the launch and widespread approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have opened the asset class to mainstream retirement accounts and wealth platforms. Interest in long-term planning has grown markedly. Hougan said Bitwise received a dozen requests this year for long-term assumptions around bitcoin, compared with none between 2017 and 2024. In his view, this marks an inflection point: institutions are now evaluating bitcoin in the same way they assess equities, bonds, and other traditional assets. While the full report is yet to be published, the preview states that bitcoin’s projected returns, volatility profile, and correlations compare favourably with established asset classes. Bitwise characterises bitcoin’s correlations with other major assets as “low”, falling between −0.5 and 0.5, which many allocators value for diversification benefits. The asset manager’s positioning of bitcoin’s outlook draws parallels with annual capital-market forecasts issued by large Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan, PIMCO, BlackRock, and Vanguard. These outlooks help institutions determine long-term strategic allocations across asset classes including equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternatives. Hougan argues that similar guidance is now warranted for digital assets, given their growing maturity and integration into mainstream investment products. Since spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, they have quickly gained traction. On-chain holdings tied to these ETFs have grown to represent almost 7% of bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply, with assets under management exceeding $146 billion, according to data from The Block. Corporate treasuries have also expanded their exposure. Publicly traded companies, led by MicroStrategy with a holding of 629,376 BTC, have collectively accumulated more than $80 billion worth of bitcoin. These acquisitions have been financed largely through capital market activities, including equity offerings and convertible debt issuance. Bitwise’s full Bitcoin Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions report is expected later this week. It will provide detailed methodology and quantitative analysis, alongside side-by-side comparisons with forecasts for traditional asset classes from leading global asset managers. For Bitwise, the release marks a bid to position bitcoin within the same framework used for decades to evaluate traditional investments. For institutions, it reflects a growing acceptance of bitcoin not as a speculative play, but as a serious allocation option with defined risk and return expectations.

Title: Liberty Steel: UK government prepares to take over plant
URL: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0yd0829m4o
Time Published: 2025-08-20T17:04:56Z
Full Content:
The government is preparing to take control of the UK's third largest steelworks in a bid to save the business and protect 1,500 jobs. Managers have been lined up to take over Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) in South Yorkshire which is owned by Liberty Steel, a court heard. The future of the company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, has been uncertain for some time and it could be wound up over its large pile of unpaid debts. It comes after ministers seized control of British Steel, in Scunthorpe, earlier this year to prevent the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel from closing. SSUK is home to the UK's largest electric arc furnace which are more energy efficient and are thought to be pivotal in the industry's energy transition. But the company has faced financial troubles for sometime and has been unable to buy the scrap metal needed to produce steel after Liberty Steel's main lender collapsed and unpaid debts mounted. A High Court judge is set to decide the fate of SSUK. Liberty Steel mill 'basically derelict' - worker Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Sheffield under threat Lawyers for Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of GFG Alliance which owns Liberty, warned that a winding up order could mean the end of steel production at the plant. They sought an adjournment to allow him to complete an administration process for the company to then be sold, without the need for any government intervention. But lawyers for the creditors produced a letter to the court from the government offering reassurance that it would step in to take over the steelworks if required. Creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds petitioned a court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty Steel's assets can be sold to pay the debts owed. Mr Gupta, whose firm owns a collection of businesses in energy, trading and steel, employing thousands of people in the UK, has faced scrutiny since GFG's main lender Greensill Capital collapsed in 2021. Sources close to the steel tycoon have confirmed reports that negotiations with investment giant Blackrock were ongoing to provide new funding to buy the business out of a managed or "pre-pack" administration. The judge on Tuesday expressed reservations saying there was no certainty as to what would happen to the company after the compulsory liquidation the creditors were demanding. "What happens to trading after the magic words are uttered?" the judge asked, referring to the formal granting of a winding up petition. "There is simply too much at stake." The case has been adjourned and referred to the High Court. While the government is a supporter of steel, it is not a big fan of Mr Gupta and has rejected his repeated appeals for direct government support. So the choice now is an unappealing one.

Title: UK prepares to take over third largest steelworks

The government is preparing to take control of the UK's third largest steelworks in a bid to save the business and protect 1,500 jobs. Managers have been lined up to take over Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) in South Yorkshire which is owned by Liberty Steel, a court heard. The future of the company, which uses scrap metal to manufacture steel, has been uncertain for some time and it could be wound up over its large pile of unpaid debts. It comes after ministers seized control of British Steel, in Scunthorpe, earlier this year to prevent the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel from closing. SSUK is home to the UK's largest electric arc furnace which are more energy efficient and are thought to be pivotal in the industry's energy transition. But the company has faced financial troubles for sometime and has been unable to buy the scrap metal needed to produce steel after Liberty Steel's main lender collapsed and unpaid debts mounted. A High Court judge is set to decide the fate of SSUK. Lawyers for Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of GFG Alliance which owns Liberty, warned that a winding up order could mean the end of steel production at the plant. They sought an adjournment to allow him to complete an administration process for the company to then be sold, without the need for any government intervention. But lawyers for the creditors produced a letter to the court from the government offering reassurance that it would step in to take over the steelworks if required. Creditors owed hundreds of millions of pounds petitioned a court to force the company into liquidation so that Liberty Steel's assets can be sold to pay the debts owed. Mr Gupta, whose firm owns a collection of businesses in energy, trading and steel, employing thousands of people in the UK, has faced scrutiny since GFG's main lender Greensill Capital collapsed in 2021. Sources close to the steel tycoon have confirmed reports that negotiations with investment giant Blackrock were ongoing to provide new funding to buy the business out of a managed or "pre-pack" administration. The judge on Tuesday expressed reservations saying there was no certainty as to what would happen to the company after the compulsory liquidation the creditors were demanding. "What happens to trading after the magic words are uttered?" the judge asked, referring to the formal granting of a winding up petition. "There is simply too much at stake." The case has been adjourned and referred to the High Court. While the government is a supporter of steel, it is not a big fan of Mr Gupta and has rejected his repeated appeals for direct government support. So the choice now is an unappealing one. Allow Mr Gupta to try and keep control though an administration – at considerable cost to the lenders whose loans would be largely written off - but zero cost to the government. Or help his creditors recover what is left of their money by taking on a loss-making steel plant for however long it takes for a buyer to be found and the sale proceeds dished out. The government said it would "continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for the company". "We are supporting the Official Receiver so that they are prepared to take the necessary steps should the company enter into compulsory liquidation," a statement said. Liberty Steel said it believed its "commercial solution backed by major private capital provides the best outcome for the business, its employees and all stakeholders concerned without cost to UK taxpayers or unnecessary uncertainty". A government intervention in Scunthorpe in 2019 cost the Treasury £600m during the 10 months it took to find Chinese buyer Jingye and since April, the government is back running day to day operations after it accused Jingye of planning to shut down its furnaces.
