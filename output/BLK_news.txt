Institutional demand roared back to start October, with crypto ETFs posting a record $4.5 billion in combined weekly inflows. Bitcoin funds drew $3.24 billion across five straight “green” sessions, helping BTC notch a new all-time high near $126,200. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge, capturing $1.82 billion for the week and $970 million in a single day, while Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL added hundreds of millions more. Trading activity was equally torrid as Bitcoin ETF volume topped $26 billion for the week and net assets jumped to $164.5 billion, underscoring that flows, not leverage, are driving this leg higher. Ether ETFs added $1.30 billion over the same stretch, also logging five straight days of inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $691.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH ($305.3 million), while Bitwise and Grayscale mini trusts contributed steady additions. ETH ETF volumes reached $9.9 billion and net assets climbed to $30.57 billion, signaling that institutional allocators are broadening beyond BTC, often pairing a Bitcoin core position with an Ethereum “growth” sleeve tied to staking yield, Layer-2 expansion, and smart-contract dominance. Technically, ETH is holding above key supports as it eyes $4,750–$4,800; a decisive break could magnet $5,000, adding fresh fuel to ETF demand and year-end portfolio rebalancing. With Bitcoin and Ether cementing their ETF beachhead, attention is shifting to potential altcoin products. Markets are tracking deadline windows and updated S-1s for large-cap names, commonly cited: Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC), as issuers push to expand the investable crypto toolkit. Any green lights here would unlock fresh mandate-driven flows, deepen liquidity, and extend the rotation now visible across large caps. What to watch in Q4: BlackRock’s leadership in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows capped a blockbuster week that pushed BTC to records and lifted total crypto AUM. With Ether ETFs surging and altcoin funds on the horizon, the Q4 playbook increasingly favors accumulation on dips as long-only capital turns crypto into a core allocation, not a trade.

Rob Crothers TIAA announced Monday the hiring of Rob Crothers as head of business development and product implementation, starting in November. Crothers, who had been BlackRock Inc.’s head of U.S. retirement, will lead efforts to develop TIAA’s strategic partnerships and business opportunities in the 401(k) corporate market. He will report to Colbert Narcisse, TIAA’s chief product and business development officer, and will be based in New York. BlackRock will not replace Crothers directly, according to a company spokesperson; Jaime Magyera will serve as head of wealth and retirement, and Crothers’ responsibilities will be absorbed by others at the firm. In July, TIAA and Transamerica Corp. announced a strategic partnership to offer the Nuveen Lifecycle Income Collective Investment Trust Series as a default option for retirement plans recordkept by Transamerica. The solution integrates Nuveen’s target-date-fund features with guaranteed lifetime income through TIAA’s Secure Income Account. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “Rob joins us at a time when TIAA’s strategy and strategic investments are coming together,” Narcisse said in a statement. “Within the next decade, it will seem as strange for a retirement plan to lack guaranteed income options as it would today for a plan to operate without target-date funds. We are not just participating in this transformation—we’‘re driving it.” Crothers took over BlackRock’s U.S. retirement unit when then-Head of Retirement Anne Ackerley moved to a senior adviser role in July 2024. During his 18 years at BlackRock, Crothers led development of BlackRock’s target-date CIT product with an embedded fixed deferred annuity and served as head of product, head of strategy, global equity lead and lead business manager. TIAA also announced that Roger Marinzoli will lead its product development and innovation team.

Title: It’s a Trust Story as NYSE Owner and Polymarket Say Yes to Tokenization

Highlights Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), owner of the NYSE, invested $2 billion in prediction market Polymarket, gaining a key role in distributing its event-driven data and collaborating on tokenization projects. The partnership is aimed at reengineering how assets and data are represented and exchanged, aiming to build trusted, transparent, and tokenized markets that could appeal to both institutional and crypto-native participants. Industry leaders like Robinhood and BlackRock also foresee tokenization transforming all asset classes; underscoring how pilot concepts are evolving into infrastructure for real-world financial operations. One would presume that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner and operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), would have its finger on the pulse of American financial markets. Literally.

Δ And on Tuesday (Oct. 7), ICE gave the rest of the world a glimpse of where it sees the infrastructure for finance heading in the future when it announced a strategic $2 billion investment in the prediction market Polymarket. The deal, which values Polymarket at roughly $8 billion pre-investment, grants ICE not only a financial stake but also a central role as the global distributor of Polymarket’s event-driven data. But just as crucially, the two companies will collaborate on a new generation of tokenization initiatives, a phrase that is becoming the shorthand for reengineering how assets, data and even forecasts are represented, exchanged and priced in modern markets. “Realizing the potential of new technologies, such as tokenization, will require collaboration between established market leaders and next-generation innovators. We couldn’t be more excited to build together,” said Shayne Coplan, founder and CEO of Polymarket, in a statement. ICE isn’t alone in its rosy view of tokenization’s potential impact across financial markets. Robinhood’s CEO also this month reportedly predicted a worldwide spread of real-world asset tokenization, calling it a “freight train” that “can’t be stopped” and which will eventually “eat the entire financial system.” Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue For the ICE-Polymarket deal, the structural safeguards, compliance obligations, and capital buffer expectations faced by ICE make it’s embrace of tokenization one that will be closely watched, and potentially later imitated, by other ecosystem stakeholders. Read also: The Digital Asset Primer: On-Chain Tokenization for Payments Professionals While the headline is about prediction markets, the subtext of the ICE-Polymarket partnership is that tokenization could reshape many other domains of finance and data. For more than half a decade, tokenization has been touted as the next evolutionary step in finance, promising faster settlement, programmable compliance, and fractionalized ownership of everything from real estate to corporate bonds. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in an earlier shareholder letter this year that: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-Founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in a separate interview. “When we started the business in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens,” he said. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” Yet outside of pilot projects, most of the world’s financial assets still trade on traditional ledgers. ICE and Polymarket are betting that the missing link has been credible data, not just software. In a tokenized ecosystem, an asset’s digital twin is only as valuable as the verifiable data that updates its state — whether that is a price feed, a corporate event, a change in weather patterns, or the outcome of a policy vote. By fusing Polymarket’s blockchain-native forecasting framework with ICE’s regulatory and infrastructural heft, the two hope to build not just isolated tokenized assets, but entire tokenized data markets. Read more: Crypto Is Coming for the Cubicle; Are Finance Teams Ready? The partnership reflects a deeper ideological reconciliation between two worlds once at odds. ICE is emblematic of the highly regulated, centralized machinery of global finance. Polymarket, by contrast, grew out of the permissionless ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), where smart contracts and crowd-sourced liquidity drive prediction markets on open blockchains. Institutional players like ICE bring credibility, scale and integration with existing financial infrastructure. Decentralized networks contribute transparency, composability, and an innovation cadence unencumbered by legacy systems. Together, they can address the core challenge that has held tokenization back: trust. By anchoring event data and derivative products in transparent, verifiable markets while ensuring distribution and compliance through an established intermediary, the partnership aims to satisfy both crypto-native participants and institutional end-users. For regulators, that combination may also be easier to supervise than the largely offshore platforms that have characterized the sector to date.

Title: Connecticut governor warns Wall Street at risk if Mamdani wins NYC mayor’s race
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/07/business/connecticut-governor-warns-wall-street-at-risk-if-mamdani-wins-nyc-mayors-race/

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont warned that his fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani could cripple Wall Street if he wins the New York City mayor’s race –and said the fallout could spill across state lines. Lamont said he was worried about a Mamdani victory and how it could upend the financial sector — both in New York and in the Constitution State — in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “New York City is the financial capital of the world — and we’re a big piece of it here,” Lamont said. “I want to make sure that the next mayor understands how important New York City is to that system, and that’s important to Connecticut.” Connecticut serves as a hub to the hedge fund industry, and is home to Steve Cohen’s Point72, Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, and Cliff Asness-founded AQR Capital Management. Many high-flying financiers also commute into the Big Apple from its neighbor to the north to work at big financial firms like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. Mamdani, a self-described socialist who won a thumping victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this summer, has campaigned on promises of rent freezes, free child care, and open government-run grocery stores. Incumbent Eric Adams dropped out last week. The 33-year-old Uganda-born Muslim has rattled Wall Street, the real estate industry, and other segments of the city’s business community with his plans to hike taxes on corporations and New York’s wealthy to help pay for his left-wing policies. Lamont said he thinks the finance industry appreciates the certainty and stability in Connecticut. “They know where the state is going to go and the taxes are a little bit less,” he told the financial news channel. A poll conducted for Fox News released on Sept 24, before Mayor Adams quit the race, shows Mamdani way out in front with 47%. Ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is currently polling at 29% and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is at 11%. The Post ran an editorial last week warning how states such as Texas are moving in to swoop up financial jobs and that New York is reaching “the point of no return” amid a looming Mamdani victory. The Lone Star State levies no state personal or corporate taxes, while New York state personal levies range from 4% to 10.9%, and its corporate tax rate runs from 6.5% to 7.25% JPMorgan now employs more people in Texas than any other US state, while Goldman Sachs is working on an 800,000-square-foot building that will open in Dallas in 2028.

Title: Bitcoin Reaches Forecasted All-Time High: Prophecy Predicts Bear Market Low In 364 Days

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has made headlines this week by consistently breaking all-time highs, recently surpassing the $126,000 mark for the first time. However, the current price action has not only drawn attention from investors but also reignited discussions surrounding a notable prediction made two years ago. An anonymous user had forecasted that Bitcoin would achieve a peak on October 6, 2025—a prediction that came to fruition just yesterday. Despite this milestone, Bitcoin has retraced to around $121,000 within hours after today’s record, leading to a wave of liquidations from long positions across various exchanges. This rapid price fluctuation has led many to speculate that the recent peak could potentially mark the cycle’s all-time high, suggesting that Bitcoin might soon enter a new bear market phase. The prediction made in December 2023 posits that if historical patterns hold true, the bear market low is expected to occur precisely 364 days later. This theory has gained traction amidst today’s volatility, with experts warning that a shift in market sentiment could be imminent. Market analyst Doctor Profit has recently cautioned that despite the current bullish trend, the market is entering a precarious phase. He noted that while there is a prevailing sense of euphoria, underlying financial indicators are signaling a potential liquidity crisis. Highlighting the current situation, Doctor Profit pointed to the Reverse Repo (RRP) market, which has plummeted from a peak of $2.2 trillion in mid-2022 to a mere $8–10 billion today. This decline raises concerns about the stability of interbank liquidity, suggesting that the financial system may soon face significant dislocations if the RRP continues to dry up. Historical parallels from 2018, 2019, and 2023 indicate that such liquidity issues often precede major market corrections. Moreover, US banks are reportedly grappling with approximately $395 billion in unrealized losses as of the second quarter of the year, putting additional pressure on their balance sheets. In the crypto space, recent trends reveal substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with firms like BlackRock contributing over $1 billion in Bitcoin and $200 million in Ethereum just last week. However, Doctor Profit contends that the market’s broader liquidity picture remains concerning. While retail traders are expressing optimism about a “liquidity flood,” the expert cautions that the influx of cash into money market funds could actually drain liquidity from broader markets rather than enhance it. The current market environment is also characterized by a notable uptick in insider selling, according to the expert’s broader landscape analysis, in which executives are reportedly offloading shares at an unprecedented rate, even as retail investor inflows surge. The expert believes that this alleged market manipulation often signals a market cycle peak, creating what he believes “a highly toxic mix” that could have adverse implications for future price movements. In conclusion, Doctor Profit notes that the overall sentiment paints a bearish picture at a macro level. Both the crypto and stock markets are seen as being at an increased risk of entering a bear market after the fourth quarter.

Estadão Conteúdo 07/10/2025 16h36 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás 07/10/2025 16h36 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás Publicidade O bitcoin caía durante a tarde desta terça-feira, 7, revertendo parte dos ganhos registrados ontem, quando ultrapassou a marca de US$ 126.000 pela primeira vez. Investidores continuam acompanhando a paralisação das atividades do governo dos Estados Unidos enquanto avaliam declarações dos dirigentes do Federal Reserve (Fed, o banco central norte-americano). Por volta das 16 horas (em Brasília), o bitcoin tinha baixa de 3,83%, a US$ 121.280,41 e o ethereum caía 4,79%, a US$ 4.480,11, de acordo com a plataforma Coinbase. Outros ativos digitais como a XRP e Solana também registraram perdas. Forte demanda global por ativos digitais impulsiona captação recorde em ETFs, enquanto bitcoin atinge valor máximo e atrai investidores em meio à incerteza econômica Após semanas de valorização, o Bitcoin mantém tendência de alta — veja os próximos alvos. A BlackRock explica que correlações negativas antigas estão se desfazendo, como a de títulos e ações. Assim, investidores estão buscando alternativas para esse tipo de dinâmica, como o ouro e o bitcoin, de acordo com a gestora. Neste cenário, os traders estão adicionando os ativos cada vez mais aos portfólios, “à medida que a eficácia de investimentos de segurança diminuiu”, conclui. A Navallier também faz a relação entre o metal precioso e as criptomoedas, vendo ambos os ativos captando fluxos que normalmente iriam para outros tipos de investimentos e crescendo nas últimas semanas. Já o Deutsche Bank vai além e afirma que o bitcoin pode estar ao lado do ouro nos bancos centrais até 2030, com a moeda se consolidando como ativo de reserva estratégica e cada vez mais legítimo conforme a liquidez e a regulação avançam. No noticiário de cripto, hoje a Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), dona da Bolsa de Valores de Nova York (NYSE), anunciou que vai investir até US$ 2 bilhões na plataforma de apostas Polymarket, que usa cripto e blockchain em seu sistema de previsões. Investidores também acompanham o shutdown do governo dos EUA, que chegou no sétimo dia hoje e segue sem previsão para acabar, com o presidente Donald Trump declarando que o líder da oposição no Senado é “incapaz de fazer um acordo”.

Title: BlackRock’s most profitable ETF is a nearly $100 billion Bitcoin giant
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/07/blackrock-etf-ibit-bitcoin-most-profitable-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T17:11:26Z

BlackRock Inc. is known the world over for its ETF suite, with funds spanning all manner of industries and themes going back nearly two decades. But one of its newest offerings is its most profitable. The issuer’s Bitcoin ETF, which is nearing the $100 billion asset mark thanks to massive inflows and a new run-up in the token itself, generates more revenue than any other in the firm’s lineup of 1,000-plus globally, according to data from Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence. Their calculations suggest that the fund, which charges a modest 0.25% fee, brings in an annual revenue haul that tops $240 million, a remarkable feat for an ETF that’s less than two years old, the pair wrote in a note. IBIT, as the fund is known, has become shorthand in the ETF industry for the crypto category given its size—and the pace at which it attained it. Its assets are on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, with money pouring in from both retail and institutional investors. Moreover, it’s “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs, with the rest having taken years to achieve their super-large loads, the BI analysts wrote. The race to $100 billion has been aided by Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high — over the weekend, the digital coin crossed above $125,000 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has soared more than 70% in the wake of Donald Trump’s November electoral win after the president campaigned on greater crypto acceptance. The administration has pushed forward initiatives to help bring digital assets further into the mainstream while feeding investors’ appetite for the class. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive,” said Seyffart, who noted that the fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their January 2024 launches. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the Bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” In its first year, IBIT took in more than $37 billion in inflows. It was an eye-popping feat many considered all the more remarkable given that critics argued investors had little need for the product as they could access Bitcoin via various exchanges. So far in 2025 another $26 billion has flowed in, a spoil that puts it in the top five largest inflows among all U.S. ETFs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All in all, it has about $70 billion more in assets than the second-largest Bitcoin ETF. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment for the story. “A lot of the success comes down to how well it sells,” said Kaiko’s Adam Morgan McCarthy of IBIT. “The digital-gold narrative has gained momentum this year, particularly back in April after the tariff announcement in the States. With government debt rising and the dollar weakening, it’s really increased the appeal of Bitcoin to a broader spectrum of investors.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Receives Federal Approval

The Texas Stock Exchange last week crossed its latest hurdle toward becoming a direct competitor to the dominance of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had approved the Dallas-based startup to operate as a national exchange was met with celebration by Texas lawmakers, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who declared “Texas is swiftly becoming America’s financial hub.” The hype around the Texas Stock Exchange, or TXSE (pronounced Tex-ee), has been building since the June 2024 announcement that the exchange intended to launch with $120 million in backing from investment large firms like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, making it one of the most well-funded attempts at a new national exchange in decades. TXSE officials say the strength of the Texas economy made the move possible, noting the many Fortune 500 companies that have come to the state, drawn by favorable regulatory and taxation policies. Texas is home to the headquarters of the second most Fortune 500 companies in the country, leading New York and closely trailing California. “Texas is a major player in the U.S. regardless of the exchange landscape, but it ultimately makes sense as the 7th largest economy in the world,” Global Managing Director of Listings Nicole Chambers told a gathering of Dallas business leaders in September, adding that 45 countries smaller than Texas have their own stock exchanges. “Texas has really become a leader in where you can do business,” Chambers said at the panel discussion at the University of Texas Austin campus. “That is why there is the Texas stock exchange. We couldn’t do this in Oregon or in Nebraska.” When TXSE begins listing stocks — that’s expected to happen next fall — it won’t even be the only stock exchange hosted in Dallas. Following the announcement of TXSE’s intention to seek SEC approval, the New York Stock Exchange in February announced it would reincorporate its Chicago electronic exchange and move it to Dallas, branding it NYSE Texas. Bill Bailey, managing director of market intelligence at TXSE, said he sees that decision as a reaction to TXSE’s creation, also noting Nasdaq’s March announcement that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas. The moves promise to test whether Dallas’ recent growth into a hub for financial services firms is significant enough to justify the city’s new nickname: “Y’all Street.” Can a startup stock exchange lure companies to join? Stock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded, connecting supply and demand “like any other market,” University of Texas at Arlington associate professor of finance Sriram Villupuram said. The bell ringings on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to signal the start of the day’s trading stand out in the minds of the public, but those events are largely for public relations as the two exchanges compete to convince companies to list themselves on their separate exchanges. Since the acquisition of the American Stock Exchange by the NYSE in 2008, the NYSE and Nasdaq have been the two dominant exchanges in the U.S., effectively creating a duopoly, Villupuram said. Regional exchanges outside of New York, like the Boston Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange have been swallowed up by the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq, while other exchanges shut down. Attempts to create a third, dominant national exchange have largely floundered, failing to attract a significant number of companies that want to list on their exchange. TXSE leadership says this time will be different. The exchange will be entirely digital but have a physical presence in Dallas, Bailey said. TXSE also intends to hold bell ringing ceremonies for its companies and incorporate much of the pomp and circumstance of its two rival exchanges with its own Texas flair, he added. With the $120 million in backing from investors like BlackRock and Citadel Securities — that amount has since grown to $161 million — Bailey said the digital exchange will be state-of-the-art and have fewer requirements for the makeup of company boards of directors than other exchanges. TXSE also hopes to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising fees and share price benchmarks at Nasdaq and NYSE. Much of TXSE’s success will depend on the patience of its investors, Villupuram said. It will take time to convince companies to list themselves on the exchange, but each company that does will build momentum. The speed at which TXSE is able to lure its first 50 to 100 companies to the exchange will be crucial, Villupuram added. “It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said. TXSE officials say the exchange’s success will also hinge on the health of the Texas economy. If the economy continues to grow, Texas will continue to attract large companies and financial firms, which TXSE officials can try to recruit into the new exchange. Stock transactions are now largely conducted digitally rather than on a trading floor, but a physical presence near major companies is still crucial for a stock exchange, Villupuram said. “With stocks, the demand, the trading has become automated, electronic, whatever you want to call it, but the supply, the courting of companies to come get listed with us, that is still very much human to human,” Villupuram said. “The landscape is changing” Historically, Dallas was a trading hub due to its central location in the Sun Belt, making it Texas’ primary location for the communications, transportation and finance industries as the state modernized. That has continued as Texas-based corporations grew and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport became a national travel hub, said Ray Perryman, president of the Waco-based economic research company The Perryman Group. “Dallas is the natural location for a financial center to emerge in this region,” Perryman wrote in an email. Top investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs now have tens of thousands of employees in the region and are continuing to grow. Goldman Sachs is in the midst of building a $500 million tower in downtown Dallas that will host more than 5,000 employees, which will make it the bank’s largest hub outside of New York, according to the company. Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2020. New York has seen just a 16% growth in employment in the investment and securities sector over the last 20 years, while Texas has experienced 111% expansion, Perryman said. The state’s lower cost of living compared to the northeast also makes it appealing to employees like Sasha Stratton, head of risk for Selby Jennings in Dallas and the South. The company assists with recruitment for financial services companies across the country. Stratton moved to Dallas from her home state of New York five years ago, seeking the opportunity to purchase a home and live a higher quality of life for less money. “(Firms) are prioritizing hiring in Dallas over hiring in New York in a lot of instances, which I think is a pretty unique shift,” Stratton said. “That’s driven by the availability of talent, the cost of operations, the availability of real estate and with the Texas Stock Exchange and other exchanges following suit, realizing it’s not a compromise to be building out in Dallas, it’s actually a smart, strategic decision to take advantage of how booming the economy is.” The shift in economic activity to the south paired with the deep pockets of TXSE’s funders suggests the exchange could be a formidable competitor to the NYSE and Nasdaq, Perryman said. TXSE’s launch coupled with the expansion of NYSE and Nasdaq to the area will make it easier for growing Texas companies to access capital, allowing for more expansion and hiring, Perryman added, creating a feedback loop that benefits both the exchanges and the Texas economy as a whole. “New York will likely remain the primary center of equity markets for the time being, but the landscape is changing,” Perryman said.

Ethereum ETFs have already gotten off to a strong start for the week, pulling in $176.6 million during Monday’s trading session, according to data from Farside Investors. Last week, Ethereum funds around the world pulled in $1.48 billion, per a report from CoinShares, marking a substantial comeback after being in the red the week prior. Ethereum got incredibly close to topping $5,000 in late August, when it set a new all-time high of $4,946.05. Ethereum is currently changing hands for $4,560 after having gained more than 10% since last week. That puts it 7.6% away from its all-time high price. Earlier Thursday, ETH rose as high as $4,753, per CoinGecko. Users on Myriad are growing more confident that the upward trend will continue for Ethereum. As of Tuesday morning, 80% of users think ETH will see $5,000 sooner than it could dip to $3,500. That’s a marked uptick in optimism from last week, when users were evenly split on which price Ethereum would see next. Rodriguez-Alarcón, who used to work at BlackRock and JPMorgan, added that risk assets in general have benefited greatly from the monetary policy signals coming from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which next meets at the end of the month to decide on interest rates. “On the macro front, a dovish Fed tilt, ongoing pressure on fiat currencies, and positive momentum in gold could unlock additional flows into risk assets,” he said. “In that environment, Ethereum stands to benefit disproportionately given its foundational role across DeFi, stablecoins, and tokenization infrastructure.” That macroeconomic environment has led to one of the biggest stock rallies in 15 years as investors rush back into emerging markets. “The dollar’s weakness has acted as the spark, but this rally is also about the maturity of emerging markets themselves,” wrote deVere CEO Nigel Green in a note shared with Decrypt. He noted that Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are all drawing renewed interest from foreign investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers are working towards the Fusaka upgrade, which has been called the biggest scaling bet yet for the network. The project’s roadmap says it is planned to arrive before the end of the year. “The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in November, introduces key improvements such as parallel execution in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a major step toward alleviating scaling bottlenecks in the next growth cycle,” Rodriguez-Alarcón said.

Title: Starbucks’ sweeping store closures aren’t a surprise. Here’s why

By Megan Ulu-Lani Boyanton, The Seattle Times Deanna Meyerhoff, 55, moved to Seattle in 1993. Back then, the expansion of Starbucks was just so tremendous,” she said. Until recently, Meyerhoff would treat her daughter to pink drinks and stop for iced black tea lemonades while on walks with the family dog, she recalls. But those are memories now. Her favorite Starbucks stores in her neighborhood, Haller Lake, recently shuttered as part of a slew of closures announced by the company last week. Living in the coffee giant’s hometown, “it definitely hits differently when it’s a local company,” Meyerhoff said. “It’s a shareholder thing: You grow or you die. And they grew — and, now, they have to shrink back to actually make money.” Meyerhoff isn’t an industry analyst, but her assessment is shared by some who see last week’s $1 billion Starbucks restructuring plan, including layoffs and store closures, as a move to please investors. Like other large coffee chains, Starbucks is trying to stand out among the competition and welcome more customers through its doors all while fighting global and local headwinds — from production costs to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. It has not been easy. In July, Starbucks reported mixed quarterly results, including increased revenue and decreased profit. At $558 million, the company’s profit was almost half of what it reported for the same quarter a year earlier, and earnings per share were 49 cents — a drop from 93 cents for the same period in 2024. At the time, CEO Brian Niccol, less than a year on the job, talked about his experience with turnarounds, adding, “We’re building back a better Starbucks experience and a better business.” The recent changes could be a step toward buoying the business. “We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders while balancing our investments in our long-term growth strategy,” said Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith in a statement this week. While Seattle’s coffee lovers might not have paid much attention to industry struggles, Starbucks store closures beginning late last week jolted their attention. Laurie Fryett said she will miss her Mill Creek Town Center location, which shuttered as part of the cull. “I’m disappointed that Starbucks is closing neighborhood locations, especially because, over the years, I’ve found that it’s a great place just to go, relax, connect with friends,” she said. “I know there’s a lot (of Starbucks stores), and it’s probably a hard decision to have to close, but it’s going to affect so many people.” Starbucks declined to share the number of stores slated for closure but confirmed its app is up to date. According to the app, dozens of Seattle-area locations have been impacted, even though some of them appeared to loyal customers to be well-loved. Performance was not the only consideration in the decision-making process. In his announcement of the closures, Niccol said coffeehouses are opened and shuttered for a number of reasons, including financial performance and lease expirations. Fryett, 72, just wants a nearby Starbucks coffee shop with a patio where she can sit and sip hot chocolate with whipped cream in the sunshine. While customers like her hunt for new spots, hundreds of workers will be hunting for gigs. Part of the restructuring plan involved another round of corporate layoffs — 900 last week, on top of 1,100 earlier this year — and the store closures will likely entail more job losses on the retail end. Starbucks told The Seattle Times on Tuesday that it was notifying affected retail workers, and they will either be transferred or extended a severance package. “We’re working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them,” Niccol said. “For those we can’t immediately place, we’re focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages.” Starbucks refers to workers as partners. There’s potential for future job opportunities, he added. “We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.” Niccol joined Starbucks at a shaky time for the company. In 2024, under then-CEO Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks’ profits and revenue had plummeted, which led to “the biggest fall in the stock since the start of the pandemic,” according to Bloomberg. Niccol had handled fast food companies in crisis before. A former leader at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, he was brought into the fold at Chipotle in 2018 after the chain’s customers fell ill from food-related illnesses. After almost seven years with the company, Niccol was credited with doubling its revenue — a veritable success story. At Starbucks, the hope was Niccol could appease the company’s shareholders. “His retail excellence and track record in delivering extraordinary shareholder value recognizes the critical human element it takes to lead a culture and values driven enterprise,” longtime former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement announcing Niccol’s transition. As of June, the major shareholders in the publicly traded company were investment management companies: The Vanguard Group with 9.5% of shares, BlackRock with 4.5%, State Street with 4.1%, Goode Capital Management with 2.1%, and Invesco with 1.9%, according to financial services company The Motley Fool. It also listed Schultz as holding 1.9% of shares. On top of investor expectations, Niccol also has had to contend with market dynamics rocking the coffee industry. The underlying cost of production is high, the effects of the COVID pandemic are still being felt, there’s more competition in the industry, and U.S. tariffs on major coffee-producing countries are causing strain, said Peter Roberts, professor of organization and management at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. And so Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” plan was born shortly after he took over in September 2024. He aimed to focus on “empowering” baristas, meeting customer expectations and improving the experience at stores through a series of steps that included streamlining pricing and phasing out mobile orders. In announcing the store closures last week, Niccol placed it squarely as part of his Back to Starbucks plan. “Over the next 12 months, we also plan to uplift more than 1,000 locations to introduce greater texture, warmth, and layered design,” he said. Chris Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, a coffee industry consulting company and podcast, depicted the coffee giant as trying to move away from the “transactional” environment at its stores and instead embrace the coffeehouse ambience. “The methodology of trying to get there, though, I feel is a little faulty,” he added. Deferio said Starbucks is competing against other large coffee chains and basing corporate decisions off of moves made by those companies. Deferio believes Starbucks should focus on training managers and meeting the needs of workers in order to improve the customer experience — and ultimately see the results it wants. “Based on the moves that they’ve made so far, it amounts to an aestheticism but not to a substantive experiential change for the people that go to the stores,” he said. “It’s just new paint on the same thing, and we’re supposed to accept it as a huge turnaround.” Over decades, Starbucks focused on expanding into foreign markets, according to The Strategy Institute, a business strategy certification program provider. Since 1996, with the opening of its first international location outside North America, Starbucks has utilized three approaches — wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensing — to expand its global empire, The Strategy Institute said. Out of over 41,000 stores around the world, the U.S. and China made up 61% of the company’s portfolio, Starbucks said at the end of the third quarter. At that time, more than 17,000 locations were operating on U.S. soil, while China was home to almost 8,000 stores. In the third quarter, global and U.S. store sales both fell 2%, but, notably, Chinese store sales jumped 2%. The company is in the process of finding potential buyers for stakes of its Chinese business, which is vying against national powerhouse Luckin Coffee for customers in the Asian country. Roberts, the professor, reasoned that the North American store closures could be a move by Starbucks to address saturation. “I would place a fair bet that says there’s more Starbucks saturation in U.S. cities than elsewhere, and that probably explains a little bit of this closing and opening” of stores, Roberts said. For Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, the closures come down to profitability. “What I think is happening is they’re closing these stores because they’re not profitable,” he said, “and that means people aren’t spending their money as much as they used to in a Starbucks store — in those Starbucks stores in particular. ©2025 The Seattle Times.

Deferio believes Starbucks should focus on training managers and meeting the needs of workers in order to improve the customer experience — and ultimately see the results it wants. “Based on the moves that they’ve made so far, it amounts to an aestheticism but not to a substantive experiential change for the people that go to the stores,” he said. “It’s just new paint on the same thing, and we’re supposed to accept it as a huge turnaround.” Over decades, Starbucks focused on expanding into foreign markets, according to The Strategy Institute, a business strategy certification program provider. Since 1996, with the opening of its first international location outside North America, Starbucks has utilized three approaches — wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensing — to expand its global empire, The Strategy Institute said. Out of over 41,000 stores around the world, the U.S. and China made up 61% of the company’s portfolio, Starbucks said at the end of the third quarter. At that time, more than 17,000 locations were operating on U.S. soil, while China was home to almost 8,000 stores. In the third quarter, global and U.S. store sales both fell 2%, but, notably, Chinese store sales jumped 2%. The company is in the process of finding potential buyers for stakes of its Chinese business, which is vying against national powerhouse Luckin Coffee for customers in the Asian country. Roberts, the professor, reasoned that the North American store closures could be a move by Starbucks to address saturation. “I would place a fair bet that says there’s more Starbucks saturation in U.S. cities than elsewhere, and that probably explains a little bit of this closing and opening” of stores, Roberts said. For Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, the closures come down to profitability. “What I think is happening is they’re closing these stores because they’re not profitable,” he said, “and that means people aren’t spending their money as much as they used to in a Starbucks store — in those Starbucks stores in particular. ©2025 The Seattle Times.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Notch Biggest Daily Inflow Since Trump’s Re-election Record As IBIT Approaches $100B In Assets
URL: https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-notch-biggest-daily-inflow-since-trumps-re-election-record-as-ibit-approaches-100b-in-assets/

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. topped $1 billion worth of net inflows on Monday for the first time since July 11, as the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency rocketed to a fresh lifetime peak of over $126,000 on Monday. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s market-leading iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is already the asset manager’s most profitable ETF, is nearing $100 billion in assets under management. The nearly dozen US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their second-largest day of inflows on Monday. The funds saw a cumulative $1.18 billion in inflows, second only to Nov. 7, 2024, when the ETFs drew in a record $1.37 billion after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the election to become the next President of the United States. BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with a staggering $970 million in investor money entering the vehicle on Monday, according to Farside data. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with an inflow of $112.3 million, while Bitwise’s BITB and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) raked in $60.1 million and $30.6 million, respectively. As Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in a Monday post on X, the 11 Bitcoin funds have cumulatively clocked approximately $60 billion since their debut last year. The significant demand for these spot Bitcoin ETFs underscores the massive influence of institutional investors in the current bull market, with retail investors reportedly still on the sidelines. The BlackRock BTC ETF is on the brink of crossing $100 billion in assets under management. As highlighted by Seyffart’s colleague, Eric Balchunas, IBIT has generated an estimated $245 million in annual revenue, making it now the most profitable ETF for the Wall Street giant by a huge margin. IBIT currently has an AUM of roughly $98.46 billion in Bitcoin and cash, and it holds 783,767 BTC, data from its official website shows. The world’s largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, took 2,011 days to achieve the $100 billion milestone, while BlackRock’s IBIT is about to do it in just under 450 days, NovaDius President Nate Geraci posited. “Easily fastest ever,” he said, adding that only 18 of over 4,500 trading ETFs since 1993 boast $100 billion in assets under management. Bitcoin traded hands at around $124,880 as of publication time, up 0.3% on the day, according to crypto data provider CoinMarketCap.

Today’s top news: A MetaMask token is indeed incoming. And it’s coming along with a rewards program. Season 1 of “MetaMask Rewards” will distribute $30M+ in incentives, including Linea (the ConsenSys L2) tokens, plus referral perks, mUSD bonuses, partner rewards, and “token access.” MetaMask also posted that a rewards program is coming and warned against circulating “details” that aren’t official, indicating specifics will roll out in stages. All of this lands just weeks after the wallet launched mUSD, its native stablecoin designed for wallet-native payments and DeFi flows. “There’s been chatter about a MetaMask rewards leak. Those concepts were early prototypes — not live. But the vision behind them is very real. And it is all about building a token economy.” - Joe Lubin, Consensys founder on X “Any of the details you’ve previously seen/heard are not indicative of what is to actually launch. Let’s talk a little bit about what the actual MetaMask Rewards program WILL be. This program will yield referral rewards, mUSD incentives, exclusive partner rewards, access to tokens, and more. However, it is not a farming play. It is shaping up to be one of the largest onchain rewards programs ever built - in MetaMask Rewards Season 1 alone, we’ll be distributing over $30M in LINEA token rewards.” - MetaMask on X There have been a lot of questions and speculation around how a MetaMask token would work. And how historical activity would be rewarded (if at all). Well, this new rewards program likely raised more questions, but it did provide some answers. We still don’t know how historical activity will be rewarded. But one thing is now clear - there will be a playbook given from the MetaMask team on how to earn rewards. And $30M in LINEA is just a taste of what’s to come (and a pretty big prize in itself). Expect rewards to be given around mUSD, Linea DeFi, MetaMask perps activity and more. With the airdrop likely to be in the 9-figure range, if not higher, expect a lot of competition with this one. But given how busy the airdrop farming landscape is right now, perhaps dedicated users can find an edge… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Artprice News lifts the veil on the current state of the Contemporary Art Market with analysis by Artprice's econometrics department. As galleries, auction houses, and art advisors examine the causes and consequences of the slowdown in the global art market, the 31st Artprice by Artmarket Report provides a detailed analysis of the Contemporary Art auction market. It exposes both the drivers and the extent of the contraction, but also highlights a number of positive signals: the rise of female artists, the emergence of new scenes, and the emergence of AI, which represents a genuine paradigm shift. More than just an inventory, this report outlines the key trends in tomorrow's market. Meanwhile, in order to remain focused on market trends on a regular basis, Artprice has just launched a new press agency, Artprice News, with its long-standing partner Cision PR Newswire. With nearly 30 years of experience as a World Leader in Art Market Information, we will now be publishing daily global art market news in 122 countries and 11 languages. With Artprice News®, Artprice is supplementing the weekly publication of its ArtMarket Insight® with a daily global news feed that runs 24/7. This initiative will allow Artprice by Artmarket to suplement its famous annual reports with the analysis of its proprietary AI tool, Intuitive ArtMarket®, and its partnership with Perplexity AI, giving users access to an unfathomable volume of data and parameters in its proprietary AI application, Blind Spot®. Artprice – which owns the world's largest collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues dating back to 1700 – is currently absorbing a colossal volume of historical information into its proprietary AI, Intuitive Artmarket®. This data will be tokenized for use in the next Global Art Market Annual Report (the 32nd edition) to be published in March 2026. Loyal readers will therefore have access to a whole new world. Incidentally, in response to a request by Artmarket.com's board of auditors, Artprice's collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues has recently (January 2025) been valued at 43 million euros, and it is of course, the primary foundation for Artprice by Artmarket's proprietary AI tools. Artprice's annual art market reports are now capable of highlighting extremely complex transversal artistic trends which largely escape the academic, institutional, and commercial spheres. A fractured top and bottom? One quarter of global art auction turnover may have evaporated in a single year, but the auction market has never been so busy: auction houses have in fact recorded a record number of transactions for Contemporary Art. A premium segment running out of steam, but with far more artists, more lots on offer and more traffic than ever. Over the past year, works by tens of thousands of contemporary artists have been sold through auctions around the world, and the scope of acquisition possibilities has never been broader. One in five of these artists was new to the auction market, and many of these were under forty years old. A new generation is therefore emerging, tracing the contours of tomorrow's market. The art market's affordable segment (under $5,000 or even under $1,000) is continuing to grow, fueled by online sales. Cheap and easy to access, this segment is attracting a young, connected clientele hungry for works in tune with their times and concerns, in line with their vision of a new, multi-polar world, both geopolitically, philosophically, and digitally with AI. According to Thierry Ehrmann, CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: "Affordable artworks are experiencing a tsunami of interest. Indeed, this interest prompted us to meet with senior executives of the main global auction houses in NY and Beijing to discuss ways of promoting artworks priced between $5,000 and $15,000 and open up to sales in cryptocurrencies, now conducted mainly by ETFs since 2024, after the United States approved the Bitcoin spot ETF as well as the Ethereum spot ETF. Giants like BlackRock (iShares Bitcoin Trust) and Fidelity now offer these products that directly replicate the price of Bitcoin/Ethereum. They are tradable like traditional stocks and eliminate all technical ownership risks. Almost three years ago, Artprice by Artmarket moved to quote all of its art catalog databases in Bitcoin and Ethereum, including price fluctuations since March 2010 (birth of Bitcoin), in addition to the 8 international currencies that already existed in our databases. This initiative raised our database consultations in cryptocurrencies from 2% to 36%. Today, this means that the 300 new millionaire art collectors are mostly young computer scientists between 25 and 40 years old who own Bitcoin and Ethereum. These new art buyers are seeking a form of social recognition that they find in the purchase of art, and particularly in digital artworks with the emergence of AI, which represents a genuine paradigm shift in art. Based on its long-nurtured expertise in AI (since 1987 with Groupe Serveur, its parent company, its proprietary AI Intuitive Artmarket® and its recent collaboration with Perplexity) Artprice predicts that compared with today's several hundred generative AI creators, the future will see the emergence of billions of creators of all ages and professions, among whom several million will emerge to radically expand the volume of the art market like never before in its history. At the premium end of the spectrum, the market's powerhouses are marking time: six-digit results have fallen sharply. Hong Kong's art auction turnover is half the average of the last ten years, and the picture is not much better in London and New York. The most powerful marketplaces – the United States, China, and the UK – currently account for more than three-quarters of global art auction turnover. Meanwhile, Paris now stands out as the world's most dynamic capital in transaction volumes, ahead of London and New York. New scenes and new faces Our auction data also reflects the emergence of new scenes and the emergence of new faces. The Japanese scene is confirming its influence beyond Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara. Female artists are reaching important new milestones, breaking records and challenging the long-established hierarchy. As screens of all sizes become increasingly present in our daily lives, the Contemporary Art Market has every opportunity to explode. Digital images, promoted by a multitude of outlets dedicated to digital artworks, now have a quality of definition beyond what the human eye (the sensor) and the brain (the actual generator of the image) can observe. Screens now offer exceptional resolution at a cost that has been divided by ten in just a few years. Moreover, the creation of digital artworks, based on AI prompts, offers artists infinite possibilities without having to learn computer programming (which constituted a real obstacle to artistic creation). The best auction result so far for an AI artwork was hammered for Ai-Da Robot's A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing (2024) on 11 July 2024, fetching $1.1 million at Sotheby's New York. This sumptuous work is a tribute to Alan Turing, a true pioneer of AI, who, thanks to cryptanalysis, deciphered the Nazi Enigma Code, enabling the Allies to win WWII. Prosecuted in 1952 for his homosexuality, Alan Turing was sentenced to chemical castration and decided to end his life by taking cyanide on 8 June 1954. Queen Elizabeth II recognized him as a war hero and granted him a posthumous royal pardon in 2013. Faced with this paradigm shift, auction houses are rethinking their strategies like never before, and, with rare audacity, collectors are redefining their priorities, and young buyers are imposing new codes. Contemporary art is therefore not on hold: it is changing course and paving the way for a more inclusive, more fluid, and more diverse ecosystem. Artprice News ® focus on the fate of blue chips. From the destiny of blue-chip artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Banksy, and Marlene Dumas, to the unexpected breakthrough of new artists via an ever-broadening spectrum of marketplaces and the digital revolution, Artprice's 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report is a dive into the underlying dynamics of a rapidly changing market. A market where every dataset tells a story and where every trend already outlines the contours of tomorrow's market. More than just a statistical inventory, this 31st global report suggests what the future may look like. It also focuses on opportunities that can be seized in a fractured market, which artists are on an upward trajectory despite the prevailing caution, and which scenes are emerging while others are slowing down. The 2025 Contemporary Art Market Report is available free of charge in PDF, in French and in English: https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2025 Based on the analysis of auction sales of works by more than 47,000 contemporary artists worldwide (July 2024 – June 2025), this report has long established itself as the industry's Bible.

Zhou highlighted how tokenized assets and stablecoins have evolved from experimental concepts into critical components of the global financial system. The RWA market has expanded by more than 400% in three years — from $5 billion in 2022 to over $30 billion in 2025. Private credit and U.S. Treasuries lead this growth, commanding $14.7 billion and $7.3 billion respectively. Global institutions including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan are paving the way, while McKinsey and Standard Chartered forecast tokenized assets could reach between $4 trillion and $30 trillion in the coming decade.

Global institutions including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan are paving the way, while McKinsey and Standard Chartered forecast tokenized assets could reach between $4 trillion and $30 trillion in the coming decade. Meanwhile, stablecoins have become the backbone of on-chain transactions, with a market capitalization exceeding $300 billion as of September 2025. Cross-border payments grew by more than 1,000% in the first half of the year, as financial institutions adopted blockchain-based settlement solutions. "Stablecoins and tokenized assets are no longer ideas for the future — they are the building blocks of a more efficient and transparent global financial system," Zhou said. Zhou also noted the growing role of payment giants such as Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and Stripe, which are now integrating stablecoin settlements into their global networks. "When companies that serve hundreds of millions of users embrace blockchain payments, we are seeing a fundamental shift in how money moves around the world," he added. Bybit's Strategic Position in the New Financial Landscape Bybit continues to build the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. Zhou outlined several key initiatives that highlight Bybit's leadership in this transformation: "Bybit's mission is to connect traditional finance with the blockchain economy," Zhou said. "The future belongs to those who see blockchain not as a replacement for traditional finance, but as a tool to strengthen it. When history looks back, it will show how this technology fulfilled its promise — creating a more inclusive, transparent, and resilient financial system for all." #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk /#Token2049 About Bybit Bybit is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 60 million users.

IBIT is sitting "a hair away from $100 billion" in assets under management, and now generates approximately $244.5 million in annual revenue for BlackRock, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted Monday. $IBIT a hair away from $100 billion, is now the most profitable ETF for BlackRock by a good amount now based on current aum. Check out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd. pic.twitter.com/E8ZMI2wynx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 6, 2025 "Check out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd," Balchunas wrote, pointing to how the Bitcoin ETF has leapfrogged established funds, including the 25-year-old iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. "IBIT being the most profitable product for the largest issuer of ETFs in the world, clearly shows the size of the demand from institutions and retail, and this milestone should eliminate any doubt on risk appetite for Bitcoin,” Pratik Kala, head of research at Apollo Crypto, told Decrypt. As of Monday, IBIT held $98.47 billion in assets across 1.38 billion shares with a 0.25% fee, on track to hit $100 billion in just 435 days, far faster than Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF, which took 2,011 days. Jagdish Pandya, founder of Blockon Ventures, told Decrypt that comparing Bitcoin ETFs with traditional ETFs is "an injustice to old asset classes." He attributed the disparity to Bitcoin's structural advantages, noting that traditional assets have "higher supply, no scarcity, low returns, no financial disruption" and therefore "have no chance to outperform Bitcoin ETFs." Pandya argued that that were Bitcoin's price to eventually top $1 million, "all ETF comparisons will stop," adding that Bitcoin ETFs would "emerge as a clear leader, more profitable than decades-old funds." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $124,500, trading flat on the day after hitting a new all-time high above $126,000 earlier in the week, per CoinGecko data. Last week, IBIT recorded $1.8 billion of the $3.2 billion in total inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in its second-largest week on record, according to Farside Investors data. The performance came as investment products tied to crypto saw huge inflows of $5.95 billion globally last week, according to a CoinShares report. Addressing concerns about potential market downturns, Ruchir Gupta, co-founder of Gyld Finance, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin's correlation with risk markets could drive outflows during equity downturns, "the ETFs have opened up Bitcoin to a much larger investor base, a part of which is longer-term sticky holders." The net effect is "IBIT's success and AUM reduces volatility in a correction,” he said. Gupta expects international ETFs to "act like larger distribution arms and extend the reach of BTC as an asset, and net add to Bitcoin rather than necessarily drain liquidity from IBIT." The development comes as BlackRock seeks approval to tokenize ETFs and other real-world assets after launching BUIDL in 2024, a fund offering tokenized U.S. Treasury exposure.

Title: Will BlackRock Stock Rise On Upcoming Earnings?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/07/will-blackrock-stock-rise-on-upcoming-earnings/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T11:30:36Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is scheduled to announce its earnings on Tuesday, October 14, 2025. According to consensus projections, revenues are expected to increase by approximately 20% year-over-year, reaching $6.22 billion, while earnings per share are anticipated to be around $11.80. This growth is likely fueled by elevated market levels compared to the same time last year and an increase in organic base fee revenue. Additionally, the company is expected to see an uptick in revenues from technology services and subscriptions. The organization’s current market capitalization stands at $179 billion. Over the past twelve months, revenue totaled $22 billion, demonstrating operational profitability with operating profits of $7.7 billion and a net income of $6.4 billion. While results will largely depend on how they measure against consensus expectations, grasping historical trends could enhance your chances if you are a trader focused on events. There are two approaches to doing this: either understand the historical probabilities and position yourself before the earnings release or analyze the relationship between immediate and medium-term returns following the earnings announcement, adjusting your position after earnings are disclosed. That being said, if you're interested in gaining upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieving returns greater than 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights regarding one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional information for observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings is summarized along with the statistics in the table below. A relatively lower-risk strategy (though less effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair with the strongest correlation, and execute the corresponding trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a recent 3-year history. Note that 1D_5D indicates the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all three: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), providing strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you're looking for upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock like BlackRock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved more than 91% returns since its inception. Why is this the case? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk relative to the benchmark index—a less turbulent experience, as represented in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$122,199.00 remains in an uptrend, despite the overnight pullback. The world's largest cryptocurrency is on fire, having rallied nearly 10% in one week. While the buzz around BTC is natural, other sub-sectors, such as real-world assets (RWAs), are lighting up big time and deserve attention. On Monday, Ondo Finance, one of the top five RWA projects by market value, announced the acquisition of Oasis Pro, a U.S. firm with full SEC broker-dealer, ATS, and Transfer Agent licenses. The takeover enables Ondo to offer compliant tokenized securities products in the U.S., including the issuance, trading, and management of tokenized assets such as equities, corporate debt, and structured products. The ONDO token rose nearly 5% to 96 cents, while continuing to trade well below its December 2024 peak of $2.14. In a parallel development, the RWA-focused Layer 2 blockchain, Plume Network, said that it has been registered by the SEC as a transfer agent. The license allows Plume to manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network. The network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% to over 12 cents on the announcement. Taken together, these announcements signal that the digitization and tokenization of traditional assets are gaining regulated traction, bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. In other news, Cathie Wood’s ARK Venture Fund invested about $10 million in Securitize, a BlackRock-backed tokenization firm. The stake makes it ARK’s eighth-largest holding. Speaking of the market outlook, the path of least resistance for BTC remains on the higher side, supported by ETF inflows. However, there is an interesting point to consider: Each of the previous times ETFs pulled in $1 billion or more in a day or two, bitcoin's price put in an interim top and subsequently corrected lower, according to CoinDesk analyst James Straten. Additionally, the dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against major currencies, remains resilient despite discussions of faster Fed rate cuts against the backdrop of the U.S. government shutdown. A potential rally in the greenback could weigh on cryptocurrencies and gold. The latter is fast closing on the $4,000 mark, a rally that has likes of Citadel concerned. Stay alert!

BlackRock's IBIT outperforms the asset manager's other funds with $244 million annual revenue amid Bitcoin ETF boom. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investor activity in US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surged sharply on Oct. 6, mirroring BTC’s continued price gains and growing institutional interest. According to data from SoSoValue, the twelve approved funds collectively absorbed about $1.2 billion in inflows. This is their second-largest single-day haul since launching in 2024 and the strongest performance this year. Much of that demand concentrated around BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which pulled in nearly $967 million in fresh capital and nearly $5 billion in trading volume. IBIT is now on the verge of crossing the $100 billion assets-under-management threshold, an unprecedented milestone for a digital-asset product. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT has already produced an estimated $244 million in annual revenue for BlackRock, surpassing the earnings of the firm’s other long-established funds. That profitability reflects how deeply institutional money has begun to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream portfolio strategies. Meanwhile, the latest wave of inflows extends a broader pattern of strength that the financial investment vehicles have registered recently. Last week alone, Bitcoin ETFs attracted around $3.2 billion in net new capital, marking the second-highest inflow on record. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Mercer Lands $1.2B Hollywood RIA, Tax Firm

Singer Burke and its RIA, SB Capital Management, will join Mercer’s Regis Group ultra-high-net-worth practice. October 7, 2025 Mercer Global Advisors has purchased a Los Angeles-based wealth manager and tax consultancy specializing in entertainment and creative professionals. Denver-based Mercer, which oversees more than $83 billion in assets, will have Singer Burke’s RIA, SB Capital Management, and Singer Burke Zimmer & Kogan, an accounting, tax, business and financial consultancy, join its ultra-high-net-worth-focused Regis Group. That practice, which it acquired in 2022, is a specialized team within Mercer focused on clients with $25 million or more in investable assets, currently accounting for approximately $20 billion of the firm’s total assets. “It’s the fastest growing part of our firm,” Mercer President Daniel Gourvitch said. “In the Regis Group, we have a number of specialties—private market investors, technology executives, specialists with business owners who are selling their business.” Now, Singer Burke will bring expertise in working with media, entertainment and creative professionals to Mercer, which Gourvitch said will become a resource for advisors throughout the firm when working with such clients. “It creates an anchor focused on creative professionals in the UHNW space, but also can help across all our segments,” he said. Singer Burke was founded in 1972 by Sandy Singer and grew into a 60-person firm well-known in Hollywood as a wealth and tax management firm for industry professionals such as producers, writers, actors and composers. The firm is now led by partners Matthew Burke, Richard Singer (Sandy’s son), Elaina Kogan, Stephanie Connor Arkof and Amitha Harichandran. Related:RIA Arm of Ramaswamy’s Strive Spins Off as Independent Firm The group was seeking a partner who would provide a “professional management team, enterprise-scale operations and technology, and a wider set of client services including estate planning,” according to the announcement. Gourvitch said Mercer will also benefit from Singer Burke’s tax and business management side, as it will scale those services at Mercer for high-net-worth families. “Mercer tax and estate has about 200 professionals in it,” he said. “This will deepen our bench, obviously, with UHNW clients and also add a set of specific management services applicable to the clients.” Gourvitch joined Mercer in 2022 from BlackRock, where he was a managing director and global head of platform for its Aladdin business. He said one of the reasons he joined the RIA was to help build a wealth manager with the capabilities of a large, bank-owned firm, but with a fiduciary mindset. “We have the boutique core of an RIA without the trade-offs,” he said. Related:Beacon Pointe, BIP Wealth, Raymond James, Unveil 850M+ Deals Mercer is majority-owned by Oak Hill Capital, Genstar Capital, Altas Partners and GIC, a global institutional investor. Earlier this year, it hired Ted Motheral from the Potomac Law Group as principal, M&A partner development. “We’ve added a premier team, in a key market, which strengthens our ability to deliver a comprehensive family office experience for today’s most successful families,” Motheral said in a statement. Jim DiPisa of Dalphia Partners advised Singer Burke on the transaction.

Title: How ‘absurd’ momentum drives BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF toward $100B

Time Published: 2025-10-07T10:00:05Z

The demand for BTC ETFs surpassed ETH ETFs in the past 30 days. IBIT is set to reach $100 billion AUM in under 450 days — faster than any ETF in history. It has led to strong ETF inflows, fueling a spot-market demand that could further rally BTC. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin [BTC] Trust ETF (IBIT) has smashed records and is now on track to hit $100 billion assets under management (AUM) milestone. It will become the fastest ETF to hit that target and currently the most profitable product across the BlackRock ETF lineup. With less than a two-year-old, IBIT’s explosive growth is “absurd”, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In fact, IBIT raked in $244 million in annual revenue based on the press time AUM of $97.8 billion. Source: X In 2024, IBIT closed the year with $51 billion in AUM. At the time, the average BTC price was approximately $93,000. Although the Q1 2025 headwinds and tariff wars dragged AUM to $47 billion, it has rebounded to over $97 billion as of October. That’s about $50 billion added this year. Source: Soso Value If this pace of ETF inflows continues for the rest of Q4, IBIT could cross the $100 billion mark by October. Reacting to IBIT’s growth, ETF Store founder Nate Geraci added that the leading ETF took five years to cross $100 billion. “World’s largest ETF, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, took 2,000+ days to hit that mark. IBIT is about to do it in < 450 days. Easily fastest ever.” Source: Bloomberg That being said, the overall BTC ETFs inflows rebound in H2, led by IBIT, have surpassed collective Ethereum [ETH] ETF inflows. According to CryptoQuant, in the last 30 days, BTC ETFs absorbed $4.61 billion in inflows while ETH ETFs lagged behind with $1.05 billion. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn noted that the shift implied a likely rotation from ETH to BTC. Source: CryptoQuant The shift could stall the ETH/BTC rally seen in Q3. Meanwhile, the strong BTC ETFs and Spot market demand lifted BTC price to a new all-time high $126.1K. At press time, however, it had slipped slightly below $124K. With key liquidity pools at $118K, $120K, and above $127K to $130K, these could be key price targets to watch in the near term.

Title: Morgan Stanley Recommends a 4% 'Opportunistic' Crypto Portfolio Allocation

U.S. banking titan Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee (GIC) recommends an allocation of up to 4% of portfolios to cryptocurrency, according to an Oct. 1 note. The 4% allocation is at the top end of GIC's recommendations, pertaining to investors seeking "opportunistic growth," according to the note, shared on X by Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley on Sunday. Investors seeking balanced growth or market growth should allocate 2% and 3% respectively. However, for those seeking wealth conservation or income, the allocation should be 0%. The GIC described cryptocurrency as "a speculative and increasingly popular asset class that many investors, but not all, will seek to explore," adding that its commentary is focused primarily on bitcoin BTC$122,199.00, which it said is "akin to digital gold." For comparison, BlackRock and Fidelity, which both offer crypto investment through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) both recommend an allocation of about 2%, where other ETF providers Grayscale and VanEck have offered recommendations of 5% and 6%. For many in the crypto industry, that major financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley and BlackRock recommend any allocation at all is a sign of how far cryptocurrency has come since the days when certain banking execs labelled it a "fraud".

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Log $1B Inflows Again, a Level That’s Marked Local Tops Six Times Before

The U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a $1.2 billion net inflow on Monday, marking the seventh occasion that inflows have exceeded $1 billion, according to Farside data. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which attracted $970 million. Historically, when inflows reach around $1 billion, it has often coincided with a short-term top in bitcoin’s price. The first instance occurred on March 12, 2024, when bitcoin peaked at around $74,000 two days later on March 14. The next two instances were in November 2024, when bitcoin surged above $100,000, with large inflows appearing just before the rally concluded in December. On Jan. 17, another $1 billion inflow preceded a local top near $109,000 on Jan. 20. Similarly, on July 10 and 11, consecutive $1 billion inflows were followed by a short-term peak of $123,000 on July 14. On Monday, bitcoin climbed above $126,000, so it remains to be seen whether a new high will form in the coming days, with bitcoin around $124,000. Meanwhile, Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, with assets under management just shy of $100 billion, generating an estimated $244.5 million in annual revenue. The next closest fund by revenue is the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. Balchunas also highlighted that IBIT is approaching $100 billion in AUM in just 435 days, whereas the next-fastest ETF to reach that milestone, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), took 2,011 days.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs draw $1.18B in a day, near historic record amid rally

US. spot Bitcoin ETFs log $1.18 billion inflows, second-largest ever. Bitcoin hits record high above $126,000 before easing slightly. Institutional buying through ETFs fuels rally amid “Uptober” optimism. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States registered their second-largest day of inflows ever on Monday, coinciding with Bitcoin’s surge to a new record high above $126,000. Data from Farside Investors showed that the 11 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a combined $1.19 billion in a single day, trailing only the $1.37 billion inflows recorded on November 7, 2024, following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Monday’s surge brought total inflows for October to $3.47 billion in just four trading days. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X that Bitcoin ETFs have now amassed approximately $60 billion in cumulative inflows since their launch last year — a reflection of sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin exposure. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the pack with an extraordinary $970 million in inflows on Monday. The fund has now attracted $2.6 billion since the start of October and is nearing a historic milestone. According to Nova Dius President Nate Geraci, the BlackRock ETF is close to crossing the $100 billion mark in assets under management (AUM), holding approximately 783,767 BTC valued at about $98.5 billion in Bitcoin and cash. “The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF took more than 2,000 days to reach $100 billion in assets, while IBIT is on the verge of doing it in under 450 days,” Geraci observed, highlighting the unprecedented pace of capital accumulation. Only 18 out of over 4,500 trading ETFs have surpassed $100 billion in AUM, he added. Other major beneficiaries included the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $112 million in inflows, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) with $60 million, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) with $30 million. Bitcoin’s rally has been heavily driven by institutional participation through ETFs, allowing large investors to gain exposure without the need for direct custody. Analysts suggest that retail participation remains limited, underscoring the role of institutional capital in the current bull phase. The latest rally has also been supported by what traders term the “debasement trade” — a shift toward non-sovereign assets such as Bitcoin and gold amid the ongoing US government shutdown, which has delayed key economic data and heightened policy uncertainty. The move into Bitcoin reflects a broader sentiment among investors seeking protection against potential monetary easing and inflationary pressures. After touching an all-time high of $126,186 on Monday, Bitcoin pulled back slightly due to profit-taking but remained firm. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency traded flat at around $123,427.9. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $3.2 billion in net inflows in the week ended October 3 — the second-largest weekly haul since their inception — including $985 million on October 3 alone. Seasonal optimism, commonly referred to as “Uptober,” has also contributed to the market’s buoyant tone. Historically, October has been a strong month for Bitcoin, and investors appear to be positioning accordingly. Despite minor pullbacks, analysts note that the confluence of ETF demand, macroeconomic uncertainty, and seasonal strength continues to reinforce Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

Jennie O\u0027Sullivan A book of condolence in memory of the late educationalist, social advocate and former City Councillor, Don O'Leary, has opened at Cork City Hall. Mr O'Leary died on Friday aged 68 after a long illness. He was the director of the Cork Life Centre for 18 years. The centre offers an alternative one-to-one relationship-based education for young people. Jailed for three years in the late 1980s for membership of the Provisional IRA, Mr O'Leary was elected a member of Cork City Council in 1999 for Sinn Féin. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that Mr O'Leary was passionate about education and had made a significant contribution to creating learning opportunities for young people for whom conventional education did not always suit. "He believed in the dignity of every individual, and the capacity of every individual to grow". Lord Mayor of Cork Councillor Fergal Dennehy said that "by listening to, respecting and supporting young people, using the Servol Life Centre model, Don guided hundreds of young people, many facing challenges, to a place where they could visualise a future for themselves, where they could self-motivate and could continue their education. "Perhaps most importantly, he gave them the keys to their future. "Those who met and knew him, will remember his warmth, humour and unshakeable belief in the potential of every young person. "His legacy will endure not only in the centre he helped create, but in the lives transformed by his dedication". Mr O'Leary was buried yesterday at St Michael's Cemetery, Blackrock, following requiem mass at the Church of the Resurrection in Farranree. © RTÉ 2025.

Shares of the local arm of South Korea's LG Electronics were allotted at the upper end of the ₹1,080 to ₹1,140 price band, an exchange filing showed late on Monday. The initial public offering comes during the second-busiest quarter on record for Indian listings, with firms set to raise up to $8 billion. LG Electronics India had planned for a listing by May after filing for an IPO last December, but delayed the share sale citing market volatility. Blackrock invested 971.6 million rupees, Singapore's wealth fund 1.71 billion rupees and Norway's wealth fund 1.05 billion rupees. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was allotted shares worth 1.02 billion rupees. Domestic mutual funds were allotted about 49% of the shares set aside for anchor investors, with SBI and HDFC funds among the biggest buyers. Together, anchor investors will buy about 30% of the 101.8 million shares on offer at the IPO. Anchor investors are large institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, who are allotted shares before the subscription opens for retail and other investors. These investors are subject to a mandatory lock-in period after listing, in which they cannot sell their shares. LG Electronics India's three-day share sale opens for other investors on October 7. The firm is India's second largest appliance maker and competes with Whirlpool and Samsung , in the domestic market. Its parent firm is looking to make India its global manufacturing hub, for its competitive labour costs and strong domestic demand, an executive told Reuters last week.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Regional Crypto Power Balance Is Shifting as Japan 'Ready to Pop’
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/07/asia-morning-briefing-regional-crypto-power-balance-is-shifting-as-japan-ready-to-pop
Time Published: 2025-10-07T01:43:37Z
Full Content:
Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. The conventional wisdom holds that the battle for Asia's crypto hub is a contest between Singapore and Hong Kong. Both cities have English as an official language and use Western-inspired common law in their court system. But during Token2049, executives weren't debating whether Singapore or Hong Kong would win the title of Asia’s crypto hub. Instead, they were talking about how Japan, once written off as overregulated, had quietly become the region’s most credible market for real trading volume, staking infrastructure, and institutional growth. “Japan had no regulation for a long time, don't forget, that's where crypto basically happened, and then it went super stringent, and nothing happened for a long time," Konstantin Richter, the CEO of Blockdaemon, told CoinDesk during Token2049. "But people kept on chiming away, and now they actually have a regulatory infrastructure that’s institutionally scalable and about ready to pop. Whereas here [in Singapore], it was a free fall, and now they're starting to build up regulation.” Singapore moved fast and then tightened. It opened its doors early to crypto firms, building a reputation as Asia’s sandbox for innovation. That worked, until it didn’t. The collapse of FTX and other failures exposed weak consumer protections, prompting the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to swing toward heavy supervision in 2024. The result: higher compliance costs, mandatory custody segregation, external audits, and slower licensing. Those that don't like it have to leave, even if they aren't serving Singapore-based customers. It's a lot of work for a relatively small market. “Singapore was so crypto-friendly that everyone wanted to come here,” Richter said. “Then it built up, things happened, and suddenly you’re like, wait a minute, we do need more stringent rules.” Japan, by contrast, did its hard regulatory work years ago. Following Mt. Gox (2014) and Coincheck (2018), Japanese regulators had already imposed strict licensing, segregation, and onshore custody rules long before FTX imploded. By 2025, instead of tightening, Japan is opening slightly: allowing institutional staking, setting a pathway for crypto-backed ETFs, and clarifying how firms can offer yield. Unlike Singapore’s innovation-first, regulate-later approach, Japan’s regulators wrote detailed rules for custody, segregation, and security years ago. Exchanges must hold client assets separately and use domestic validators, creating the kind of environment institutional investors prefer. Richter said Asian clients, particularly in Japan, are willing to pay for institutional-grade infrastructure, a contrast, he noted, to Europe, where customers are typically more price-driven. The shift isn’t just regulatory. Japan's almost invisible yield – the Bank of Japan only ended negative rates last year – makes staking unusually attractive: a 3 % ETH yield is 30 times higher than domestic treasury returns. That’s why Blockdaemon and other node operators see Tokyo as the next major destination for institutional staking flows. Derivatives exchange BitMEX is also taking notice. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, BitMEX CEO Stephan Lutz said the exchange had just moved its data center to Amazon Web Services' facility in Tokyo to be closer to where the action is. Japan’s crypto framework, once criticized for being too strict, now gives it a clear edge: predictable oversight, investor protection, and rising institutional yield. Now, the question is, how will the usual hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore compete? BTC: Bitcoin surged past $126,000 in a “perfect storm” of macro tailwinds. Yet this latest breakout above $125,000 came largely from non-institutional demand. With ETF inflows paused and retail traders fueling momentum through high perpetual funding rates, BTC’s resilience above prior highs suggests whales are holding steady and scarcity narratives are deepening. ETH: Ethereum traded around $4,705, extending its recent strength on renewed interest in on-chain fundamentals, upgrade optimism, and rotation from BTC to altcoins, as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) added 179,251 ETH last week, bringing its holdings to 2.83 million tokens worth $13.4 billion, in a bid to control 5% of Ethereum’s supply and solidify its position as the second-largest listed crypto treasury after Strategy. Gold: Gold traded around $3,960, nearing Bank of America’s long-held $4,000 target, but the bank’s analysts now warn the metal looks overbought and could face a Q4 consolidation after a 50% yearly rally, even as longer-term charts still leave room for gains toward $5,000–$7,000 if the bull cycle continues. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 hit another record high Tuesday, boosted by a Wall Street tech rally and strong chip stocks following the OpenAI-AMD deal, extending gains after Sanae Takaichi’s election as Japan’s next prime minister, which fueled optimism over pro-growth policies.

The wave of political uncertainty in the developed world kept investors largely pinned towards gold. Persistent bets on more interest rate cuts by the U.S. FED also benefited metal markets. Rate cuts are contingent on the path of inflation and the labor market. Increased gold buying by China has also been supporting the bullion prices. China is diversifying its foreign reserves from the dollar and U.S. Treasuries to Gold. Akin to these buying is the strong Gold ETF inflows. The safe haven demand for gold ramped up, especially as a U.S. government shutdown’s political deadlock doesn’t seem to end soon. It has stretched into the eighth day. Gold is not a short-term trade or a technical breakout story. Its factual about gold not being under any default and it’s a form of capital requiring no counterparty credibility to maintain value. Gold is the ultimate hedge against runaway debt. The world debt scenario is leading to the gold story. When the world runs on debt, gold becomes the final line of defense. The global debt-to-GDP ratio stands above 324%. Global debt climbing to a record-breaking height of $337.70 trillion. It’s this that’s driving gold and not inflation per se. Debt is climbing faster than output and gold has become the stabilizer. As regards the US angle, once the dollar was unpegged from gold, governments began to spend with abandon, instead of cutting spending or raising taxes.

Shares traded at Rs 1,023.80 on the NSE, down 2.51% Gold active futures reached a new high, hitting $4000 (~ Rs 120,900), as financial markets became increasingly unsettled due to the US government shutdown and a French political crisis. The political upheavals in Japan and France are escalating fiscal worries and fuelling the gold rally. · After unsuccessful attempts to come to an agreement with political parties about budget spending, which prevented efforts to control the biggest fiscal deficit in the euro area, Sebastien Lecornu resigned as the prime minister of France. The financial markets have also been shaken by Sanae Takaichi’s almost certain promotion to the position of prime minister of Japan. · This week, the US government shutdown continued, and the White House threatened to lay off a large number of federal employees. Additionally, this has prevented investors from accessing crucial information required to evaluate the state of the US economy, which further muddies the Fed’s decision-making process. The Fed’s latest interest rate cut and the expectation of more have helped, and central banks and gold-backed exchange-traded funds have been eager buyers. Technical Triggers · Gold has achieved the target of $4000 (~Rs 120,900) today. This rally can show more upward spikes, but one needs to be very cautious at this level. We can also see sharp sell-offs, as the psychological target is achieved.

Goldman Sachs raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to $4,900 per ounce from $4,300 per ounce, citing strong Western ETF inflows and likely central bank buying. “We see the risks to our upgraded gold price forecast as still skewed to the upside on net, because private sector diversification into the relatively small gold market may boost ETF holdings above our rates-implied estimate,” Goldman said.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Latest High As Multiple Factors Create ‘Perfect Storm’

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin prices rallied to a fresh, all-time high on Monday, October 6, breaking previous records as the digital currency benefited from what one market expert described as a “perfect storm” of bullish factors. “Institutional inflows and Fed rate cuts along with a weakened dollar create the perfect storm for demand in Bitcoin - a hedge against currency debasement,” independent cryptocurrency analyst Armando Aguilar stated via email. Aguilar commented on how the U.S. government shutdown, which began Wednesday, October 1, has fueled robust demand for both bitcoin and gold, which many view as safe-haven assets in times of political uncertainty. “As the U.S. Government has shut down, investors have rotated capital from U.S. assets in favor of Gold and Bitcoin, resulting in higher demand in safe-haven assets, driving prices of both these assets to historical ATH levels,” said Aguilar. He certainly wasn’t the only analyst to highlight the impact of this event, as the YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also focused on this particular development. “The US government shutdown is a significant factor contributing to the price increase of Bitcoin,” she stated via email. “Bitcoin is notably seen as a hedge against economic and government uncertainty and is intended to be used as a hard asset, similar to gold.” Several market observers emphasized the growing role that institutional investors are playing in the markets for the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. “Institutional demand for Bitcoin has accelerated, as more Digital Asset Treasury Companies have emerged to create Bitcoin strategic reserves, causing an accelerated demand for Bitcoin,” noted Aguilar, “Not to mention the increased Bitcoin ETFs demand from endowments, Sovereign wealth funds and other corporates.” The YouTuber who goes by Wendy O also offered some insight on this situation, emphasizing the fact that the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT, was able to reach $80 billion in assets under management faster than any other exchange-traded fund in history. Several media outlets reported on this milestone back in July, which Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, mentioned via a post on X (formerly Twitter). “It seems that we can further attribute Bitcoin’s growth to the demand of the BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF,” said Wendy O. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also offered his perspective, emphasizing that both “continued spot ETF inflows” and “renewed institutional demand” have been major contributors to bitcoin’s recent rise above $126,000. The U.S. dollar has been having a rough year, having declined close to 10% since the start of 2025, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY started the year at roughly 108.49, and declined to as little as 96.63 last month, according to MarketWatch data. At the time of this report, the DXY, which measures the strength of the greenback relative to six major fiat currencies, was approximately 98.12, additional MarketWatch figures reveal. Aguilar spoke to this weakness, stating that “YTD, the U.S. dollar has depreciated ~10%, while Gold and Bitcoin have been some of the best performing assets YTD.” Comex futures for gold recently climbed to nearly $4,000, attaining an all-time high, according to Google Finance data.

Share this article BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $5.5 billion in trading volume today, highlighting continued institutional interest in crypto assets. BlackRock’s IBIT has emerged as a dominant force in spot Bitcoin ETFs, driving the majority of recent inflows and controlling significant liquidity as of early October 2025. The asset manager holds a notable portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply through its ETF product. Fidelity’s FBTC is actively contributing to capital cycling among spot Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting broader institutional accumulation strategies. In late September 2025, the investment firm demonstrated aggressive rotation of capital within the sector as institutional adoption of Bitcoin through spot ETFs continued to gain momentum.

Title: Grayscale Adds Staking Rewards To Ethereum And Solana Trust ETFs In Major Industry First

Grayscale has debuted staking to its Ether and Solana investment products, becoming the first-ever crypto fund issuer to feature staking rewards via U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). Grayscale announced on Monday that it has introduced staking functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-biggest such fund on Wall Street with $4.82 billion in net assets, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), describing the development as “another first-mover milestone” for the company. “Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: ETH) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto ETPs to enable staking,” the company said in a Monday announcement. Today, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (Ticker: $ETHE) have become the first U.S.-listed spot crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) to enable staking, another first-mover milestone for the firm. Grayscale Solana Trust (OTCQX:… pic.twitter.com/45963Bn9UW Staking has also been enabled for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which is awaiting regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to be converted into an exchange-traded fund. If approved, GSOL could become one of the first spot Solana ETPs with staking. Staking is key to how proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum and Solana function. Users help validate transactions and keep the network secure by staking their funds and earning tokens in return. By activating staking, Grayscale gives investors exposure to ETH and SOL, while earning rewards from the blockchain networks without directly holding or managing the underlying assets. Grayscale indicated that it will stake assets passively via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator partners, aiming to help secure the protocols while supporting long-term network resilience. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking in the ETH and SOL funds was “exactly the kind of first-mover innovation” that the company was designed to deliver. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors,” Mintzberg added. Grayscale plans to roll out staking to additional products “as the digital asset ecosystem evolves.” The key selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs currently dominate the flourishing sector.

Title: IBIT approaches $100B in AUM as BlackRock’s most profitable ETF

IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has approached $100 billion in assets under management, making it the firm’s most profitable ETF despite its launch just 435 days ago. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Oct. 6 that IBIT now generates more revenue for BlackRock than funds that have been operating for decades. The age disparity stands out sharply in BlackRock’s top 10 revenue generators. At one year old, IBIT outearns the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which has been operating for 25 years and holds $121.8 billion in assets. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, despite managing $68.4 billion and $701 billion, respectively, also trail IBIT in profitability over 24 years of operation. IBIT charges a 0.25% fee on assets, generating approximately $244.5 million in annual revenue at current levels. The fund’s profitability stems from both its substantial asset base and relatively high fee compared to BlackRock’s Core S&P 500 ETF, which charges zero basis points. Balchunas also shared that IBIT sits $2 billion away from the $100 billion threshold and is on track to shatter the record for the fastest ETF to reach that milestone. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds that record at 2,011 days. IBIT will complete the journey in roughly one-fifth of that time. The Bitcoin ETF’s velocity extends beyond individual fund comparisons. IBIT and BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) pulled in $10 billion in monthly inflows as of Oct. 5, ranking third and fourth among all ETFs for monthly flows. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs collectively pulled in $3.3 billion in the week ending Oct. 3, pushing year-to-date inflows to $24 billion and lifetime flows to approximately $60 billion. The $60 billion mark represents a new high-water mark for the product category since launch in January 2024. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs following a surge in ETF inflows, briefly crossing $125,500 on Oct. 6. The cumulative flow chart shows a steady acceleration from $12 billion in March 2024 to $40.25 billion in February 2025, followed by a jump to $59.54 billion by October 2025.
