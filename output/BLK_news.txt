Title: Remember when corporate America steered clear of politics on social media?

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts. Elisabeth Kempf. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer There was a time when corporate America was not very online. Most companies used social media for promoting products and services or engaging with consumers in a friendly fashion. Political posts on a company Twitter account were rare. That all changed between 2012 and 2022, when the volume of partisan speech on Twitter (now called X) from large corporations surged, more than doubling beginning in 2017, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. Researchers said the spike was driven disproportionately by companies using language associated with Democratic politicians. The moves frequently had negative effects on company stock prices. In this edited conversation, the paper’s co-author Elisabeth Kempf, Jaime and Raquel Gilinski Associate Professor of Business Administration, explains corporate Twitter’s abrupt shift. It seems ubiquitous now, but corporations putting out partisan-sounding tweets is only a recent development. What did you find? Partisan speech was very rare for companies. Less than 1 percent of all the tweets they sent between 2012 and 2017 would constitute what was, according to our measures, very partisan speech. Wading into partisan, polarized issues can be tricky for companies. We saw the first big change in 2017 where both Democratic and Republican partisan speech picks up, and then this big asymmetry starting in 2019. That was the part that I found the most surprising. I was expecting to see some companies also start to use more Republican-sounding speech — to see, essentially, evidence of polarization. It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states, companies that are in consumer-facing businesses, also B2B [business to business]. “It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states.” How did you define partisan corporate speech? We built on previous work by Jesse Shapiro, my colleague at Harvard, and his co-authors. They developed this methodology to look at partisan speech in Congress that identifies phrases that allow you to correctly guess a speaker’s political party. We used their methodology and applied it to tweets sent by Democratic and Republican politicians. That allowed us to identify highly partisan phrases and then apply it to corporate speech. Essentially, phrases that sound like they could be coming from a Democratic or Republican politician is what we consider partisan speech. What did you learn about how partisan corporate speech has changed over time? The first fact is that partisan corporate speech has become more common over this time period, 2012 to 2022. The second fact is that this growth was really asymmetric. Starting in 2019, we see rapid growth in Democratic-sounding speech, while Republican-sounding speech stayed constant or, if anything, decreased toward the end. And third, when we look at stock returns around these partisan corporate statements, we see that they tend to be followed by negative abnormal stock returns. That said, we also see a lot of heterogeneity depending on the investor composition. For example, if there are more funds with ESG [environmental, social, and governance] objectives, then we see that the stock return after a Democratic-sounding statement tends to be less negative. Is it clear why these partisan Twitter statements suddenly escalated during this time? In 2017, we see both Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech go up for the first time. We don’t have so much to say on that. What we do have more to say on is when we start to see this divergence between Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech, which is in January 2019. That was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink put out a pretty influential letter, his “Dear CEOs” annual letter. He explicitly called on CEOs to be more vocal, take more stances on polarizing issues. This would be another potential piece of evidence to suggest that large institutional investors may have also played a role in this. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager so there was a lot of news reporting that this had kicked off a lot of discussion in the business world. Also in 2019, the Business Roundtable [a CEO lobbying association] came out saying shareholder value maximization should not be the sole purpose. So, I do think it was quite influential. We also see that 2019 was a massive growth in terms of the assets under management with a sustainability mandate. This is when a big shift happened in the investment industry. Recently, we’ve seen protest campaigns against Tesla and Bud Light spurred by perceived partisan corporate statements. Could robust consumer boycotts that threaten profits have contributed to declines in shares as opposed to just public or investor reaction to statements? This was the finding we struggled the most to make sense of. One possibility is, as you say, that maybe there could be facts of this partisan speech that affect what we would call the cash flows in finance or the profits that the companies make. For example, it might be losing employees or losing customers. We argue that partisan speech can affect a third potential stakeholder group — investors — and how much they are willing to hold the stock. We were looking at the 500 largest companies by market capitalization, so these are very big companies that need to raise capital from a pretty heterogeneous investor base. It’s hard for these large companies to raise capital only from Democrats or only from Republicans. And so, once you make a partisan statement that aligns with one group but not with the other, you might see precisely this negative stock price effect. It is also difficult to explain the growth in Democratic-sounding speech with consumer or employee preferences alone. To be clear: We wouldn’t want to conclude that investor or consumer preferences did not play a role at all. But we thought it was worth pointing out that it was hard to explain everything just with consumers or just with employees. Why is that? Because we see this rapid growth both for companies that are in consumer and non-consumer-facing industries. Boycotts could explain why maybe certain retail companies might adopt a certain speech, but we see it even in materials, which is a sector with companies that make metals, chemicals, coatings and things like this. It’s hard to think that there the consumer preferences for partisan speech would be super strong. I thought employees could be quite relevant, but we saw the same trend in companies with employees located in very Democratic areas versus Republican areas. We also didn’t see that labor market tightness played a role. You might imagine that if you’re really in desperate need of talent, maybe you would engage more in this partisan speech if you thought it would help in hiring. There were a couple of results that just made it hard to explain this with consumers or employees alone. Whereas, if you think about this investment channel, it could explain why we see it in companies that are based in blue areas, red areas. It could explain why this is such a broad-based phenomenon. Are there other aspects of corporate speech ripe for further research? Yes. I don’t think we have fully answered the question of why this big shift was happening then. We have suggestive evidence that investors could have played a role. But I don’t think there’s a full, causal relationship yet. So that is one big open question: How influential were investors versus consumers versus employees? The second question is what were the more long-term effects? We’re looking at stock prices over a relatively short window. What does this do in the longer run to companies, and potentially also to their relationship to politicians or how partisan speech by companies influences politics, I think, are exciting areas for future research.

Dart services between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire in Dublin have recommenced after a “major disruption” saw services suspended until 8pm. While services have resumed, ongoing delays and alterations are expected into Wednesday evening, Irish Rail said. Services were suspended at 2.40pm after overhead lines between Booterstown and Blackrock were damaged during vegetation maintenance works. Irish Rail said the damage had caused a “major disruption to Dart services” with significant delays to wider services as crews arrived on-site to rectify the issue. The fault caused knock-on delays to Dart and commuter services through the city centre due to congestion on the line with Dublin Bus services honouring rail tickets throughout the disruption. Services were solely operating between Howth/Malahide and Lansdowne Road as well as from Greystones to Dalkey until late on Wednesday evening while trains to Dundalk, Drogheda, Maynooth were also affected. Services to and from Rosslare departed and terminated at Bray due to the disruption with bus transfers being arranged. A spokesman for Irish Rail said the line between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire reopened shortly before 8pm after the overhead lines were repaired.

Title: Adani Group to raise ₹2.5 trillion over five years to fund capex

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Adani Group needs to raise about ₹2.5 trillion (about $30 billion) over the next five years to meet its $100-billion capital expenditure plan and meet its debt obligations, two top executives said, outlining the conglomerate’s growth strategy as it emerges from last year’s bribery allegations. The capital investments will be focussed on the energy and utilities and the infrastructure and logistics sectors, said Sagar Adani, executive director of Adani Green Energy Ltd and nephew of Adani Group chair Gautam Adani. Sagar Adani spoke with Mint on Wednesday in his first media interview since US authorities in November charged him along with Gautam Adani and group executive Vneet Jaain with securities fraud. He did not comment on the subject. Gautam Adani said in his recent annual address to shareholders of flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd that the group would invest $15-20 billion ( ₹1.3-1.7 trillion) annually over the next five years. That investment figure was the base case, said Jugeshinder Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer, adding that under ideal circumstances the investments could be higher. Adani Group invested ₹1.26 trillion in FY25 and is looking to increase its capital expenditure this financial year, Singh said, adding that the group accounts for a fifth of the private capex in India. While the bulk of the group’s capex needs will be met through the cash it generates, the conglomerate will need additional fund infusion, including to service its debt, Singh said. The Adani Group has about ₹1.6 trillion in debt maturities between 2025-26 and 2029-30, as per an investor presentation. “We will borrow to refinance the debt that we need to pay back. (Including refinancing and capex) we’ll need roughly ₹2.5 lakh crore ( ₹2.5 trillion) in new borrowings over the next five years," the CFO said.

We only do two things as a group—one is energy and utilities and the second is transport and logistics," he said. “All the other things we do are around these two fundamental pillars." For instance, in the cement sector, three-fourths of the cost are energy, raw materials, and logistics, Adani explained. Adani Group, which has become the second-largest cement maker in India by a wide margin through a string of acquisitions starting 2022, is betting on group synergies to source cheap electricity and coal and on low transportation costs to beat peers in terms of margins, Adani said. “No one can supply electricity at scale and cost better than us, and no one can handle and operate logistics in a more streamlined way that we can," he said. The group also plans to invest in copper, aluminium and other metals in the coming years. Adani Group operationalized a copper smelter with capacity for 0.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in Mundra earlier this year, which it plans to ramp up to 1 MTPA. The copper relies on ore imported from Chile. For aluminium, the group plans to bid for bauxite ore mines through government auctions. Once raw material supply is secured, it will invest in aluminium. Both the metals consume significant energy for production, giving Adani Group an edge by sourcing cheap power, he said. Also read | Adani Ports’ latest deal raises growth concerns—markets aren’t impressed Airports demerger, cements mergerAmong Adani Group’s various companies, it is the airports business that would be listed next, Sagar Adani said. Presently, this business is housed under the group’s flagship company Adani Enterprises, which is also the group’s incubator for new businesses. The airports business, which operates eight airports including Mumbai and Ahmedabad, will be ready for demerger from Adani Enterprises by FY28, said Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the group’s multiple listed cement companies, including Ambuja Cements Ltd, ACC Ltd, Sanghi Industries Ltd, and Orient Cement Ltd, as well as unlisted Penna Cement Industries Ltd, will eventually be merged, but only after the operations are streamlined, he added. “The bigger objective is to first operationally stabilize everything. Currently we are not 100% there," Singh said, adding that streamlining brands, supply chains, and distribution across the group’s cement companies would take about 18 months. Sagar Adani added that although Adani Group focusses on energy and infrastructure, it does not face any risk of concentration of assets. “No single asset contributes more than 9% of our Ebitda." Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a key measure of operational efficiency. Adani Group’s emphasis on its growth strategy comes after Gautam Adani, as per media reports, began talks with US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year to seek dismissal of the criminal charges against him in the bribery probe. The Adani Group had been previously battling allegations raised by short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in November alleged that the Adanis paid or promised over $250 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure favourable solar energy contracts for Adani Green Energy, the company headed by Sagar Adani. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ was investigating whether Adani’s companies violated US sanctions on Iran. Adani Group has denied all the allegations.

Title: The Bond Market Is Cracking, And This 9% Dividend Is Ready For It

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Coupons, rates, yields and other informations are displayed. Interest rates concept. 3D ... More illustration BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is turning its back on long-term Treasuries—and that’s rattling the bond market. That, in turn, has the mainstream crowd turning its back on ALL bonds. Mainstream crowd turning its back? That’s all we need to hear! In a second, I’ll reveal a 9% “contrarians only” dividend that’s tailor-made for this critical time in Bond-land. First, let’s break down what the global investment titan is telling us here: In its weekly commentary, released June 2, BlackRock laid things out in stark terms (or at least as stark as a stuffy financial institution gets!): “Our strongest conviction [bolding mine] has been staying underweight long-term US Treasuries.” Then the real kick in the teeth: “We prefer the euro area to the US.” Ouch. BlackRock’s not alone in turning up its nose at long-term government bonds. DoubleLine Capital, led by “Bond God” Jeffrey Gundlach, is turning away, too—especially when it comes to the longest of the long bonds: “Where we can outright short [30-year Treasuries], we are,” one of the firm’s portfolio managers recently said. We’re talking about 30-year Treasuries here. Invest for three decades and get your cash back at maturity, with a steady payout kicked your way every year. Till now, these have been seen as among the safest of the safe investments. Yet as I write this, investors are demanding a near-5% yield to take on the “risk” of owning them! All of this—not to mention weak demand at a recent 20-year government bond auction—has investors fretting over bonds, corporate and government alike. We, meantime, are targeting select corporate bond closed-end funds (CEFs) like the one we’ll name below, quietly kicking out yields of 9%, 10% and more. Let’s get into why, starting with Uncle Sam. It’s not hard to see why investors aren’t keen to boost his credit line. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—famous for its rose-colored glasses—has already projected a $1.9-trillion deficit for 2025. This leaves the government with a $40-trillion debt hole, deepening by $2 trillion a year. Congress is also working through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the CBO estimates will add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade. And, of course, Moody’s recently lowered America’s credit rating. With buyers of government debt thin on the ground, long-term government bond yields are rising (and prices are falling, as yields and prices move in opposite directions). That’s a giant red flag for all bonds, right? While this interpretation isn’t exactly wrong, it focuses too much on the numbers and not enough on the human factor, specifically Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Fed Chair Jay Powell—or more specifically, Powell’s likely successor. Let’s start with Bessent, who has straight-out said he wants to lower the 10-year Treasury rate—pacesetter for consumer and business loans. He’s got plenty of tools at his disposal, including leaning more heavily on short-term debt to fund the government. That limits the supply of “long” bonds, offsetting future lame auction demand and driving up bond prices (while reducing their yields). This is something Bessent criticized former Treasury Secretary Yellen for doing. But he’s been quietly keeping it up. Finally, we’ve got an administration fixated on tariffs (which slow growth) and lowering energy prices. It won’t take much extra drilling to pull off the latter—WTI crude is already on the mat, at $63 a barrel as of this writing, on rising OPEC production. Slower growth + lower oil = lower inflation (and lower rates). Then there’s Jay Powell, who, yes, has been holding off on rate cuts. (Jay controls the “short” end of the yield curve, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans.) But Jay’s term ends in 11 months, and it’s highly likely the administration will appoint a successor who would work with the government to reduce rates. Lower “short” rates would act as a weight on long rates, helping push bond prices higher. All of this is a prime setup for high-yield corporate debt, which is being shunned along with the federal government’s credit. A top play comes from the Bond God himself: the DoubleLine Yield Opportunities Fund (DLY). As I write this, DLY yields 9%, and its real strength is its wide mandate—Gundlach is free to invest in any form of high-yield credit, anywhere in the world. That’s what we want: This bond savant unchained and working for us! He’s taking a smart approach, too, keeping most of DLY’s portfolio (just under 70%) in high-yield corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (which despite the fact that they touched off the 2008 financial crisis are highly regulated today), emerging-market debt and a range of other debt instruments with durations of three years or less. That’s a prudent setup, as shorter-term bonds still kick out strong yields and won’t be hit as hard as longer-term bonds if rates stay stuck at these levels for a while, or even rise. It also frees up Gundlach to reinvest faster as the rate picture shifts. Beyond that, since Gundlach can invest across the globe, DLY can benefit as more capital, spooked by Uncle Sam’s bloated budget, hunts for yield abroad. As I write, DLY trades at a 0.6% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) down from a roughly 1.5% premium earlier this spring. The fund also pays that 9% annual dividend with monthly distributions. It has paid special dividends in the past, too. DLY Dividend The bottom line? With Bessent working to bring down rates now, and more help likely from the Fed down the road, we’ve got a flexible setup for income and upside, guided by Gundlach himself. Let’s buy before this discount grows into a healthy premium. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Art Of Effective Board Leadership: How To Truly Add Value
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/06/11/the-art-of-effective-board-leadership-how-to-truly-add-value/

ByMarie Holive ByMarie Holive, Forbes Councils Member. Marie Holive is the COO of Proteus International and 3-time board member of public and private companies in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. When I first entered the boardroom as an independent director, the weight of expectation was palpable. It’s a space where strategic oversight, ethical stewardship and a drive for excellence converge. In my experience, effective leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about being the most effective: listening intently, asking the right questions and knowing when to support or challenge. The most valuable contributions often happen outside formal meetings: over coffee, in late‑night emails and during quiet reflection. They are built on genuine relationships, relentless curiosity and rigorous preparation. The journey to becoming an impactful, independent director is ongoing and multifaceted. It demands vigilance, humility and constant adaptation. Based on my experience across multiple boards, here are six disciplines that can help you have the greatest impact as a board director. The boardroom is an arena where diverse perspectives, competing priorities and high stakes intersect. Influence typically comes less from having all the answers and more from nurturing a space where the best answers surface. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, reminds us that “boards meet only periodically, but their responsibility is continuous.” A strong board director should be able to cut through complexity and safeguard the company’s best interests, speaking up when necessary and listening when wisdom lies elsewhere. Powerful moments can spring from a well‑timed question that reveals hidden risk, creating clarity from ambiguity. And remember: Having diverse voices across age, gender, geography and discipline in your board can sharpen oversight and reduce blind spots. Behind the scenes, it's important for directors to devote significant time to preparation. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) reports that "annual independent director time commitment has increased from less than 250 hours to more than 300 hours over the last decade." The learning agendas for many directors include things like site visits, scenario drills, outside courses and formal briefings during meetings—time deliberately reserved to expand the board’s collective expertise. Stay attuned to industry shifts, geopolitical currents and emerging risks. For example, I've found that understanding climate disclosures, generative AI and political volatility can reshape strategy. Read voraciously, ask questions relentlessly and admit what you don’t know. Schedule quarterly deep dives, invite external experts, attend director‑education programs and benchmark against peers to stay ahead. When you treat learning as a lifelong mandate, you can help your board pivot faster and with greater confidence. Facilitation is a mindset. Create dialogue, not monologues. In practice, that means ensuring every voice is heard, listening deeply and interjecting with questions that refocus discussion. For example, as Audit and Risk Committee Chair, I am responsible for fostering an environment where divergent views can thrive, and the most effective way I have found for doing this is asking probing questions that challenge assumptions while maintaining respect and collaboration. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, notes, “I learned the importance of listening and really understanding people—and listening to understand, as opposed to just thinking you have all the answers because you looked at some data.” Yet listening alone isn’t enough; the craft lies in discerning when you should intervene and framing questions to draw out perspectives that might otherwise remain unspoken. Timing is an art that involves balancing assertiveness and restraint. Silence can be as powerful as speech. Offering space can spark breakthroughs, while stepping in decisively can avert costly mistakes. I recommend using this simple practice: Pause before responding—count to five and ask yourself whether your input will add clarity or merely reiterate. Tune into the body language and energy shifts of the other person or people involved—these can signal when emphasis or breathing room is needed. In my experience, the ability to know when to speak and when to listen separates good directors from great ones and demands constant refinement, emotional intelligence and self‑awareness. Governance doesn’t begin and end in the boardroom; it extends to subcommittees, where critical topics receive deep scrutiny. Chairing Audit and Risk for three companies (two publicly listed and one private) has given me an appreciation for this engine‑room work. The role of subcommittee member goes beyond reviewing financial statements; it requires meticulous oversight of reporting, a sharp eye on risk, and transparent communication with auditors and management. Committees shoulder tremendous responsibility amid complex regulations, evolving cyber threats and heightened stakeholder expectations for transparency. The key to effective leadership here is to ensure that this risk oversight by your committees and subcommitties stays proactive rather than reactive—anticipating threats, stress‑testing controls, and creating frameworks that allow both agility and resilience. Behind every meeting lies the essential work of cultivating authentic relationships with stakeholders. Engaging with executives, employees and fellow directors outside formal settings can offer vital insight into your organization’s heartbeat. I've found that these interactions can deepen understanding and build trust, but they also demand self‑awareness. Reflect on how you show up and how your presence impacts others, especially in high‑stakes settings. Relationships rooted in trust, empathy and mutual respect are important for good governance. Understanding the people behind the data is as crucial as understanding the metrics, and in my experience, that begins with understanding ourselves. Ultimately, board service transcends strategy and finance. It’s about embodying integrity, demonstrating unwavering commitment and fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are valued. It’s about being present—not just in meetings but in the fabric of the organization’s journey. Whether you’re pursuing or practicing directorship, I encourage you to embrace the multifaceted nature of the role, remain steadfast in your pursuit of knowledge and never underestimate the power of genuine relationships. That’s where lasting impact begins. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Title: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s price outlook remains sky-high after Strategy founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg on Tuesday that a market freeze won’t come back. He argued that growing demand and limited daily supply point straight to a rally toward $1 million. According to Saylor, miners release only about 450 BTC each day. That adds up to roughly $50 million at today’s price of around $109,859. Many are trying to figure out which will be the next 1000x crypto. He said once that $50 million is snapped up by buyers, there’s no choice but for the price to climb. His view rests on the idea that active demand now matches or exceeds what miners sell. Based on reports, asset manager ARK Invest recently boosted its bull case for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. Saylor went even further. He said that as long as Bitcoin doesn’t head to zero, it’s bound for $1 million. His own firm has picked up 582,000 BTC since 2020. That stash is worth nearly $64 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Saylor pointed to big names backing Bitcoin. He mentioned US President Donald Trump, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC chair Paul Atkins as signs that the asset has won its toughest battles. He also noted that banks are lining up to offer custody services. And he praised Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and others for buying coins daily. Saylor didn’t shy away from a cautionary note. He suggested that if Bitcoin hits $500,000 or $1 million, a fall to about $200,000 could follow. That’s almost a 60% drop from the peak. His point was that big price swings are part of Bitcoin’s history—and likely its future. Beyond miner sales and whale wallets, analysts say wider market moves matter too. Spot and futures trading often top $10 billion a day, so $50 million of fresh buys might only nudge the price. Regulation could swing the other way if concerns over energy use or consumer protection grow. And rival cryptocurrencies keep popping up with new features. Reports disclose the real test will be whether steady new buyers can outpace both miner supply and selling by holders looking to bank profits. Saylor’s figures make a strong case for continued upside. But investors who build a plan around a $1 million Bitcoin should brace for big dips along the way. In the end, daily demand, political moves and how the rest of the financial world reacts will decide if those eye-popping targets really come to pass.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Ripple targets the burgeoning $19 trillion tokenized asset market through innovative XRPL initiatives and strategic alliances. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple has brought Ondo Finance’s tokenized US Treasuries product, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), to the XRP Ledger. The launch was announced on June 11 and is seen as a move to expand the reach of institutional-grade tokenized assets across the fast-rising blockchain network. According to the statement, the integration allows institutional investors to mint and redeem OUSG on XRPL using RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin. This offers an alternative to traditional finance rails by enabling seamless access to tokenized Treasury exposure around the clock. At the same time, Ripple and Ondo have also committed liquidity to ensure the product launches with strong trading activity on XRPL. RLUSD will act as a key enabler for cross-network utility and settlement. OUSG provides permissioned on-chain access to short-term US Treasury yields. According to RWA. XYZ data, the platform currently ranks among the largest tokenized Treasury products worldwide, with a reported market value of approximately $692 million. Following the announcement, Ondo’s native ONDO token recorded a 4% price gain, trading near $0.90 at press time, according to data from CryptoSlate. OUSG’s XRPL launch aligns with Ripple’s broader efforts to position the network as a competitive platform for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Over the past year, Ripple has pursued multiple partnerships, including one with Guggenheim Partners, to advance tokenization initiatives on XRPL. The firm’s strategy is driven by forecasts that the tokenized asset market could reach $19 trillion by 2033. This is already evident in the rapid traction of tokenized treasury and money market products as asset managers like BlackRock explore new ways to modernize fund distribution and settlement processes. As a result, the market is gaining broad adoption across the board. Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President at RippleX, said: “Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

June 11, 2025 07:19 ET | Source: EBC Financial Group EBC Financial Group LONDON, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EBC Financial Group (EBC) has announced the launch of over 100 new U.S.-listed Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) CFDs, expanding its multi-asset product suite and offering global client's deeper access to diversified, thematic trading opportunities. The rollout highlights EBC’s ongoing commitment to delivering institutional-grade tools across asset classes, underpinned by flexibility, transparency, and efficiency. The new offering includes ETFs listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, issued by leading asset managers such as Vanguard, iShares (BlackRock), and State Street Global Advisors. Thematic coverage spans a wide range of global macro and sectoral narratives. “This expansion reflects our vision to bridge intelligent product design with market relevance,” said David Barrett, CEO of EBC Financial Group (UK) Ltd. “The new products are a natural evolution for traders seeking targeted exposure with greater strategic flexibility. At EBC, we’re building an ecosystem that empowers both precision and performance.” Thematic Access Meets Tactical Flexibility The additional ETF-linked instruments cover a variety of market exposures, including geographic allocations like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF; fixed income-focused strategies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond Fund; and sector- or commodity-based indices including the United States Oil Fund LP and the Vanguard Health Care ETF. Other themes include dividend-related baskets, mid-cap equities, and style-based index tracking. These developments reflect wider industry interest in instruments that mirror trends in asset allocation without direct ownership of the underlying securities. Across many markets, sector-tilted and style-based index products are gaining relevance as participants seek flexible ways to align with global narratives. Historically, ETFs tracking specific economic cycles—such as commodity recoveries or emerging market rebounds—have demonstrated performance differentiation. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, for example, notably outperformed the S&P 500 during the post-pandemic recovery period in 2021, highlighting how thematic instruments can diverge from broad indices depending on market cycles. These additions serve as both stand-alone trade ideas and complementary instruments alongside EBC’s existing product lineup, enabling advanced portfolio structuring and thematic trading. Smarter Exposure: Leverage, Shorting, and Cost Efficiency in One Product Compared to direct ETF investments, it presents several key advantages as traders benefit from a simplified cost structure, with no traditional fund management fees or broker commissions. The flexibility to take both long and short positions allows for strategic trading regardless of market direction, while the use of leverage enhances capital efficiency and return potential. These trades are executed in real time via EBC’s recognised platforms, providing seamless access to market opportunities. During key market cycles, for example the post-pandemic V-shaped recovery of 2021—certain thematic ETFs, like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, significantly outperformed broader indices such as the S&P 500. Our portfolio enables traders to participate in similar trends, adapting quickly to shifting market dynamics with precision and speed.

Title: Singapore-backed realty company bets on India entertainment boom

Prestige Estates Projects Ltd., which ranks among India’s top five real estate developers by market value, is looking to sell more entertainment and dining spaces in malls while cutting back on apparel retailers, a top official said. “Shopping can be done from anywhere once you know the brand, entertainment cannot be bought online,” Muhammed Ali, chief executive officer-retail of the Singapore government-backed firm said over phone. The developer, which counts Blackrock Inc. and Vanguard Inc. as its investors, plans to allocate 40% space in malls to entertainment and restaurants, twice of what its older properties offer. At the same time, retail space will be cut from as much as 85% to 60%, Ali added. His strategy mirrors the rapid transformation in India’s consumer landscape driven by a combination of rising income levels, aspirations and demographics. It also comes as e-commerce is challenging traditional retail, and malls are trying to reposition themselves as experience-driven destinations with shopping, leisure and lifestyle thrown in the mix. India’s top cinema chain PVR Inox Ltd. is betting on a slew of big-ticket Bollywood and Hollywood releases to bring back audiences while consultancy firm Mordor Intelligence notes that quick service restaurants are seeing a steady rise in average order value and increasingly establishing themselves in retail spaces to capture a broader customer base. Prestige plans to grow its presence to 15 malls spanning 10 million square feet in cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Goa by 2030. It operates four malls at present. Prestige is expanding the scope of entertainment to include physical activities that engage people of all ages and help them “burn a few hundred calories.” Prestige shares have fallen 11% over the last year, nearly twice the decline in the NSE Realty index. The company’s profit for the year ended March 31 was down 62% on year to 6.16 billion rupees ($72.1 million), the lowest in five years. Analysts at JM Financial said in a note on Monday that they expect growth in residential sales to moderate after surging in the last two to three years. That makes it imperative for Prestige and other developers to diversify their revenue stream. “These are the things that online cannot compete with us, where senses are involved, where you need to physically be there,” said Ali, referring to entertainment and dining. The company is also focused on live performances. The new mall structure is expected to generate around 12.50 billion rupees in rentals annually by 2030, Ali said. That is a sixfold jump from a little over two billion rupees the company made in rentals in the financial year through March 2025. “We are challenging the status quo. These malls are going to be very exciting platforms,” said Ali. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin ETF Mania Is Still in ‘Very Early Days’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-mania-very-early-days/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T03:30:40Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, says the explosive success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is only the beginning. Speaking with Bloomberg’s ETF IQ on June 9, Mitchnick described the Bitcoin ETF phenomenon as being in its “very early” phase, with institutional capital still gradually working through onboarding and due diligence pipelines. “There has been nothing like this,” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s unprecedented growth. The ETF reached $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days—a record-breaking pace compared to the previous fastest, GLDY, which took 1,691 days. “Just ridiculous numbers here,” Balchunas added. Mitchnick credited this historic inflow to a combination of retail enthusiasm and the beginning stages of professional allocation. “It is a lot of things coming together,” he said. “You don’t get a chart like that without a confluence of actors all occurring at the same time.” He continued: “Out of the gate it was retail and investor demand, and that ran the gamut of small retail investors to ultra net worth. Now, more recently, we have seen steady progress of more wealth advisor adoption, more institutional adoption.” But despite IBIT’s dominance and the sector-wide momentum, Mitchnick stressed that institutional penetration remains low. “Very early,” he said when asked how far wealth advisor adoption is. “What we have seen is a concerted effort by most of the largest firms to progress through their diligence and research and approval process… You’ve seen that fast-tracked by a number of firms. We’re talking by quarters, not months.” That timeline reflects the structural reality of traditional asset management, where new ETF approval involves multi-year workflows. “Slowly but surely,” Mitchnick noted, “you have seen an acceleration, particularly in the last couple months, of more notable firms lowering barriers, granting approval to their advisors to use this, and that is set to continue.” Beyond regulatory comfort, Bitcoin’s evolving risk profile is playing a pivotal role in institutional interest. “Bitcoin is a volatile asset,” Mitchnick acknowledged. “At the same time, its risk and return drivers are markedly different from most of the rest of the assets in a traditional portfolio. That is important.” He underscored the appeal of Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets. “When institutions are looking at this, they are heavily focused on that correlation—whether it is zero or, even in some periods, negative. Then the portfolio construction case is compelling to them,” he explained. “When you look at this as a global scarce emerging monetary alternative with a whole set of risk and return factors, that correlation is what should prevail.” Asked whether the crowded Bitcoin ETF market—with a dozen products now trading—might need consolidation, Mitchnick responded optimistically. “A lot of them have been very successful. IBIT has been the leader by a fair margin, but there’s such demand that it is exciting… That is a good thing.” On the subject of Ethereum and the forthcoming iShares ETH ETF, Mitchnick was more cautious. “It is a little more of a retail-concentrated investor base than we have seen with IBIT,” he said. “The institutional investment thesis with Bitcoin as a growing global alternative is resonating quite strongly. But when we talk about Ether, there is an exciting story there, but it is more about a technology story. That is a much harder case for a lot of institutions to underwrite, especially compared to other technology things.” Ultimately, Mitchnick framed BlackRock’s digital asset strategy not as a short-term marketing play, but as a gradual integration of Bitcoin into global portfolio theory. “Many of our clients are watching closely,” he said. “We believe this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey that will redefine asset allocation globally.” With IBIT continuing to lead the pack in flows and performance—up 121% since inception—BlackRock appears well-positioned not only to ride the ETF wave but to shape its direction. “This is still the very early days,” Mitchnick reiterated. “The story is far from over.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,625.

Roughly half the participants said that their companies had increased spending on blockchain while one in five said it was a key part of their firms' strategies, although many also expressed concerns about regulation. "So, the future of money is here and it has only just begun," the report said. "But it's clear greater regulatory certainty is still required for the potential of crypto to be fully realized." The Q2 2025 State of Crypto report just dropped. TL;DR: The world loves stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/agOZ8naqoF — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) June 10, 2025 The report underscores the growing embrace of digital assets and their underlying technology with many companies that were once crypto skeptics now part of the mix of adopters. Financial services powerhouses BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are among others, have kickstarted blockchain initiatives but the survey found that companies in a range of industries and sizes have also incorporated blockchain into their businesses. The number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using blockchain has doubled over the past year, with more than 80% of these firms saying that crypto could help them "address at least one of their financial pain points," Coinbase found. "The future of money is nowhere more visible than among small and medium businesses, the backbone of the U.S. economy," the report said. "Onchain technology, especially for payments, holds great appeal to a group who see transaction fees and processing times as their top financial related pain points." Blockchain is the underlying tech on which Bitcoin's network runs: a distributed, online ledger that records transactions and cannot easily be tampered with as it uses cryptography. The technology has now lots of other uses, other than payments, with the likes of Walmart using it to track its food supply chain and major banks deploying it for their own financial products. A number of small Nasdaq-listed companies have started buying Bitcoin as a way to secure better returns for their shareholders, a trend popularized by Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—which pivoted from software development to become a Bitcoin treasury and now manages more than 582,000 BTC worth over $62 billion. The survey also found that 18% of the small and medium businesses surveyed used stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of non-volatile assets—typically the dollar. Coinbase contracted a third party to undertake the research, which looked at 100 of the Fortune 500 firms. It said that the initiatives included "internal company projects, investments, partnerships, and product/service launches."

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Crypto Confidential newsletter. Sign up here to get Crypto Confidential days earlier free in your inbox. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - MAY 28: U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivers a keynote address at The Bitcoin Conference at The Venetian Convention & Expo Center on May 28, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Yet another Bitcoin Conference has thundered to a close. This year’s pilgrimage for the faithful took place at the Venetian, Las Vegas’ most ostentatiously faux palace—a mock Venice built in the Nevada desert, complete with a casino, chlorinated canals and costumed gondoliers. Fitting, really, for the new reality of bitcoin: loud, celebrated, and depending on your vantage point, either triumphant or gaudy. Some 35,000 people poured in, an all-time high for what began as a fringe gathering of cypherpunks. The conference even set a Guinness World Record for the most bitcoin payments in a single day, if that sort of thing impresses you. Bitcoin itself hit $111,000 days before the event, a milestone barely celebrated in a market where all-time highs are now routine. At last year’s conference in Nashville, Donald Trump promised to make America “the crypto capital of the planet” and “the bitcoin superpower of the world.” This year’s installment felt like, well, proof-of-work. Trump’s lieutenants Vice President JD Vance and Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks took the stage in the main venue to offer receipts: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s warfare against crypto is over. Gary Gensler is out. Landmark crypto bills are making their way through Congress. The bitcoin reserve is in the works. Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, is free. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the campaign to choke crypto’s access to banking, has become a phrase mentioned mostly in postmortems. Major financial institutions, once terrified of reputational blowback, are swiftly rolling out digital asset desks again. And dozens of companies, including public ones, are adopting crypto treasury strategies. All this within the first 100 days of Trump’s second presidency. “Promises made, promises kept,” as Trump’s crew likes to say. "I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House," Vance boomed at his 9 a.m. keynote (doors opened at 5:30 a.m. to handle the traffic). “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape and the lawfare that we saw aimed at crypto by our predecessors.” During his panel with the Winklevoss twins, David Sacks asked the audience what else was on the industry’s wishlist. The loudest answer? “Remove the capital gains tax.” Cameron Winklevoss added: “It would be great if the American government started proactively buying bitcoin.” The irony is hard to overlook. Bitcoin was meant to be apolitical, decentralized, pure—a middle finger to the traditional financial establishment and states’ monopoly on money. And yet, the conference at times felt like an RNC spinoff, complete with speeches by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., and ovations for politicians who wouldn’t have touched the asset five years ago. The president himself called bitcoin a scam in 2021. Now he’s all in. After all, crypto has boosted Trump’s net worth by about $1 billion in under a year, according to Forbes’ calculations. His digital asset holdings are now worth more than any single piece of real estate he owns, including the combined value of Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower, writes Dan Alexander. A week before the conference, Trump hosted the largest buyers of his meme coin at a White House dinner. His family has not-quietly-at-all seeded an entire portfolio of crypto ventures: DeFi-focused World Liberty Financial, the publicly traded crypto miner American Bitcoin, and Trump Media, which announced during the conference it’s raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin for its corporate treasury. I kept wondering what Satoshi would say. Maybe he’s watching. If so, I doubt he’s smiling. Some purists did complain. Not just about the politicization of bitcoin, but about the creeping presence of “shitcoinery.” Companies behind cryptocurrencies like XRP and Sui, long associated with the other side of crypto’s ideological divide, were apparently among the sponsors/supporters. Among prominent panel topics were stablecoins and tokenization. “Most bitcoiners don’t care about the SEC’s opinion or what BlackRock and Robinhood have to say. Most bitcoiners, I guess, want to see more bitcoin stuff. Don’t forget bitcoin is about the separation of money and state. We should not invite the state. We can’t forget all the pain, suffering, murders, famine, and stealing that the state has done for centuries. bitcoin liberated us from the state,” vented one observer. Of course, internal squabbles like this barely register outside the crypto echo chamber. The reality is that the conference, like bitcoin itself, has outgrown its rebel roots, morphing into something far bigger, louder and more institutionally embedded than its earliest adopters ever imagined. Among other high-profile guests were billionaires Michael Saylor, Justin Sun (a major investor in Trump’s crypto ventures), Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, members of Congress and Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets. Ross Ulbricht delivered a closing speech, his first after being freed from prison. Three themes dominated the agenda. First, the rise of crypto treasuries. There are now over 70 public companies holding bitcoin (and we were early to spot this trend). It may still be the center of gravity, but it’s no longer the only asset in the orbit: there’s also growing attention on companies adding solana, ether and even XRP to their balance sheets. Second, legislative momentum. The stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act is on track to pass Congress. Excitement is building around the U.S. market structure bill, which could finally bring clarity and codified legitimacy to crypto in America at large. Third, cultural mainstreaming. The asset once thought of as a tool for opting out of the financial system is now being folded neatly into it: politicians are using it as a campaign plank, nation-states are buying in (the head of Pakistan’s crypto council announced at the conference that the country is also planning to establish a bitcoin reserve) and corporations are writing playbooks around it. “There’s an old-time saying ‘Everything is good for bitcoin’,” assured me Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital—one of the new bitcoin treasury companies, backed by Tether and SoftBank Group. “Do I love every single thing Trump is doing? No, there's plenty of stuff I would do differently personally if I were president. But are there things I love about the administration? Yes, I love having a bank account in the United States, where my passport is issued,” he said, alluding to the unraveling of Operation Choke Point 2.0. Perhaps he’s right. After all, partially thanks to the administration’s push on the bitcoin reserve and its wholesale embrace of the industry born out of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation, more people than ever know about bitcoin and use it. Meme coins too, but that’s besides the point. Turns out, decentralization scales best with help from the state.

Title: How a flood of retail investor money into private markets could stress the whole financial system

Retail investors are increasingly being offered access to private markets as investing heavyweights compete for their business. But the shift has created a host of risks for individuals and the broader financial system. That's the takeaway of a new report from Moody's, which warned of "systemic implications" as ETFs and retirement funds facilitate a flood of money from individual investors. Once reserved for the investing world's elite echelons, the booming private equity and private credit markets are slowly being opened up to Main Street investors. The development has sparked some debate about the wisdom of offering everyday people access to illiquid, complex investments. The report from Moody's comes as the $1.4 trillion market for private equity and credit investments has exploded in recent years. As public listings have dried up, more companies have turned to private markets for funding; however, investments from institutional investors are slowing, driving the big players to look for new frontiers. In recent months, giants including BlackRock, State Street, KKR, and Apollo have unveiled ETFs, target date retirement funds, and other investment vehicles aimed at Main Street — and there's reason to be wary, Moody's said this week. Among other risks, a flood of new money into the space could set off a race among money managers to deploy capital, the firm said. "If competition for retail capital outpaces the supply of quality assets, and if growth outpaces the industry's ability to manage these complexities, such challenges could have systemic consequences," Moody's analysts wrote. "Some managers may be tempted to compromise on underwriting standards or stretch into riskier assets to keep pace with inflows and capitalize on the opportunity." What's more, retail investor participation risks heightening volatility in times of market stress, and the market itself is less liquid and more complex than stocks. One of the big draws of the stock market for investors is that you can buy or sell shares at a moment's notice. Not so with private investments, which don't necessarily have "mark to market" valuations. "One of the most pressing concerns for 'Main Street' investors is liquidity and the inherent lack of it in private markets. Retail investors often require quicker access to their capital and have less long-term investment flexibility," Moody's wrote. The ratings agency points to the Great Financial Crisis, when people turned to their 401(k)s for cash while the economy soured. In such a situation, if money is locked up in private market investments, people could have trouble accessing their money. "In volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product's available liquidity and what investors are expecting."

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund hits $70B faster than any ETF in history

With this pace, could BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF really surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as the world’s biggest BTC holder? BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF has made history by becoming the fastest exchange-traded fund to exceed $70 billion in assets under management. The milestone reflects broader market confidence and positions BlackRock’s offering as a potential game-changer in the evolution of crypto investment products. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted, “IBIT just blew through $70B and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days.” Balchunas also highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT is surpassing expectations, reaching $70 billion in assets under management nearly five times faster than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)—the previous record-holder. Eric Balchunas on IBIT While GLD took over 1,600 trading days to achieve the milestone, BlackRock’s IBIT accomplished it in a fraction of the time, reinforcing its explosive market entry. That being said, since its 2024 debut, the ETF has secured over $9 billion in inflows in 2025 alone, earning a spot among the top five U.S. ETFs. This coincided with BlackRock recently acquiring 2,704 Bitcoins valued at roughly $283.9 million, along with 28,239 Ethereum [ETH] tokens worth an estimated $73.2 million. This rise in BlackRock’s prominence is also being reflected in the number of institutions joining the list of embracing IBIT. For instance, the Moscow Stock Exchange has listed Bitcoin Futures tied to IBIT. Additionally, JPMorgan has also planned to roll out ETF-backed loans, beginning with BlackRock’s flagship crypto fund, indicating growing confidence and utility in Bitcoin-focused investment products. Hence, with over 661,000 BTC under management, BlackRock’s IBIT has officially become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, surpassing both Binance and Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Currently valued at $71.9 billion, the ETF’s meteoric rise has also positioned it to potentially overtake even Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated holdings by next summer, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. Therefore, as IBIT shares trade near $62 and Bitcoin crosses the $110,000 mark, the ETF continues to dominate its peers, securing nearly $49 billion in net inflows since its 2024 debut. As expected, this trajectory paints IBIT as the most influential player among spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund has passed the $70 billion mark faster than any other ETF in history by a long shot, according to analysts. Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says in a post on the social media platform X that IBIT has surpassed the $70 billion mark five times faster than the gold-based GLD product. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days… When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30k and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” According to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham, BlackRock currently holds $76.19 billion worth of digital assets in its crypto wallets. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened, not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Guggenheim chooses Ripple’s XRPL for latest tokenized commercial paper issuance

Ripple will invest $10 million as part of the Guggenheim alliance to accelerate real-world asset tokenization on XRPL. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Guggenheim Partners is bringing its Treasury-backed fixed-income product to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through a new partnership with Ripple, Bloomberg News reported on June 10. Guggenheim Treasury Services, a subsidiary of the investment giant, will offer tokenized US commercial paper with customized maturity terms of up to 397 days on XRPL. The product is fully backed by US Treasurys and aims to provide institutional-grade fixed-income exposure in a tokenized format. The development comes amid rising institutional interest in Ripple’s network. As part of the agreement, Ripple will contribute $10 million to the asset, marking a strategic investment aligned with its push to expand real-world asset (RWA) tokenization across decentralized ecosystems. The fixed-income product may also become available for purchase using RLUSD, Ripple’s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Since its debut in December, RLUSD’s supply has surpassed $300 million and operates across both the Ethereum network and the XRP Ledger. The partnership builds on Guggenheim’s earlier foray into blockchain finance. In September 2024, the firm tokenized $20 million worth of commercial paper on Ethereum (ETH), a move that marked its first experiment with on-chain debt instruments. That initiative laid the groundwork for broader exploration into how blockchain can streamline issuance, settlement, and access to short-term credit products. Tokenized Treasurys and money market funds are gaining traction as asset managers seek to modernize distribution and settlement. Industry leaders including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have launched blockchain-native versions of cash-equivalent funds, while tokenization platforms such as Securitize are lowering entry barriers for investors. As of the end of March, the RWA market has now surpassed $10 billion in total value locked, with tokenized US Treasurys accounting for the vast majority of it. The Ripple-Guggenheim partnership represents a broader shift as financial incumbents look to integrate blockchain for greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in the fixed-income market.

Title: Panama Canal Boss Says MSC Ports Deal Threatens Neutrality

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo credit: Flystock/Shutterstock June 10 (Reuters) – The sale of two ports near the Panama Canal to a global consortium led by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) threatens the canal’s principle of neutrality, the canal’s head Ricaurte Vasquez told the Financial Times. “There is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,” Vasquez told the FT in a report published on Tuesday. “If there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama’s competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.” MSC is one of the world’s top container shipping groups. MSC and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal CK Hutchison confirmed last month that MSC, run by the family of Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports, including the two ports in Panama, for $22.8 billion. The clarification follows weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China over CK Hutchison’s plan to sell the ports to a consortium, which was previously led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. BlackRock remains part of the group. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Vasquez added that the canal should use the ports deal as an opportunity to become a terminal operator itself by reactivating a project to build a terminal in the Port of Corozal at the Pacific end of the canal, according to the FT.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Frenzy: BlackRock’s Speed Run To $70 Billion Shakes The Market
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrocks-speed-run-to-70-billion-shakes-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-06-10T14:30:46Z

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has hit a new high. It reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 trading days. That makes it the fastest fund ever to cross that line. Investors poured in at a pace few expected. And the milestone shows how much appetite there is for regulated Bitcoin products. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT “blew through $70 billion” on June 9. That run is roughly five times quicker than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 trading days to hit the same mark. IBIT now manages about $71.9 billion and holds 661,457 BTC. It sits ahead of Binance, with 629,190 BTC, and Michael Saylor’s Strategy at 582,000 BTC. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 Based on reports from Farside Analytics, IBIT led all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs since its January 2024 debut. It attracted nearly $49 billion in net inflows, dwarfing rivals. Yet not every day has been smooth. After a 31-day streak of fresh money, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow—$431 million—on May 30. That shift is a reminder that these funds still move with Bitcoin’s own ups and downs. At the current pace, BlackRock could hold more Bitcoin than its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by next summer. Addresses tied to Nakamoto are estimated to control around 1.1 million BTC—about 5% of the total 21 million coins. If IBIT reaches that level, one single firm would match the original stash. It’s a sign of how big institutions are moving into a market once ruled by individuals. IBIT shares traded at $61.77 at the time of writing. That’s up 5.30% over the past week, as Bitcoin’s spot price climbed back toward $110,000. When Bitcoin spikes, the ETF follows. When it dips, the fund can see outflows. In an interview last week, Blockstream CEO Adam Back opined that most individuals require an easy means of acquiring Bitcoin. According to him, most newcomers are unaware of how to configure wallets or manage private keys. However, he also cautioned against keeping “90% of it in ETFs” as it would introduce new risks. His opinion reflects the conflict between access convenience and the preservation of Bitcoin’s original design. BlackRock’s blockbuster ETF is a watershed for crypto. It reflects wealthy demand from institutional investors and brings Bitcoin within more mainstream accessibility. But it raises new questions about who controls the keys and how that power might shape markets.

Title: Circle Stock To $300?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Representation of cryptocurrency and Circle logo displayed on a screen in the background are seen in ... More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE: CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has rapidly emerged as one of the market’s most watched stories following its IPO. Currently trading around $115 — a significant increase from its IPO reference price of $31 — the company has attracted substantial institutional support and increasing public interest from investors. With the crypto-fintech sector gaining momentum and regulatory clarity becoming more apparent, many are now asking: could Circle ultimately reach $300 per share? But there is a downside case, too. See: Can Circle Stock Drop 80%? Also, check out What’s Better - Circle Stock Or Bitcoin? Additionally, See: How Can Circle’s Revenue Grow By 3x? Circle’s current primary revenue source is derived from the yield produced by the reserves supporting USDC, which now has a circulating supply close to $60 billion. These reserves, mainly invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries, generate dependable, scalable interest income — providing a foundational revenue stream. In 2024, Circle reported over $1.5 billion in revenue, primarily from interest earned on these reserves. If USDC’s circulation grows to $150–200 billion over the next three to five years — a feasible scenario given the surge in global demand for stablecoins — Circle’s reserve income alone could reach $4–5 billion annually. In addition to passive income, Circle’s product roadmap features enterprise-grade APIs for programmable payments, digital identity layers, FX rails, and on-chain treasury services. This infrastructure-first strategy positions Circle similarly to a “Stripe for digital dollars.” With substantial traction in these services, Circle could generate $2–3 billion in additional revenue from software-like recurring sources. Combining this with reserve yield, total revenue could grow to $6.5–8 billion annually within five years. See - How Circle can 3x its Revenues. Circle’s capital-light operational model allows it to scale profitably. Despite high partner distribution expenses — such as payments to Coinbase — its underlying margin profile remains robust. Over time, net margins in the range of 25–30% are likely as the business diversifies and gains more control over customer relationships. If net income reaches $1.8–2.4 billion, and Circle holds 300–350 million shares outstanding post-IPO, the company could achieve earnings per share (EPS) in the $6.00–8.00 range. At a price of $300 per share, Circle would have a market capitalization in the range of $45–50 billion. This would correspond to a price-to-earnings multiple of 40–50x, which is in line with the valuation of rapidly growing, high-margin fintech platforms — especially those developing enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, or legacy Visa during its earlier growth phase). In this situation, Circle would be valued not just for growth, but for being a unique crypto-native company with strong compliance, significant partnerships (e.g., BlackRock, Visa), and a pivotal role in the tokenization of real-world assets. A share price of $300 for Circle is not merely a bullish aspiration — it represents a goal that illustrates the company’s desire to become the digital financial infrastructure layer of the internet. To achieve this, Circle must increase the circulation of USDC, enhance its platform services, and demonstrate its ability to generate stable earnings at scale — all while maintaining regulatory credibility. If this vision becomes a reality, Circle won’t just be a stablecoin company — it will be a fundamental component of the financial system of the future. In such a landscape, a price of $300 may not signify overvaluation, but rather a fair valuation. Investing in a single stock like CRCL carries risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which contains 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. What’s the reason for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less volatile experience, as shown by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. India is a sizzling market for private credit, though some participants are wondering if in their eagerness to close deals, investors are shutting their eyes to risks, especially the legal minefields around collateral and bankruptcy. A decade ago, India’s banks were struggling with the world’s biggest load of soured corporate loans. At about $200 billion, the write-offs on that exposure have been large. Deposit-taking institutions that tried to recover the debt via insolvency proceedings have had to accept harsh haircuts. Traditional lenders are so scared by that experience that personal credit, which was less than half of banks’ advances to industry 10 years ago, is now 1.5 times as large and growing nearly twice as fast. Credit demand and supply have changed in other ways, too. Large firms, traditionally the heaviest users of bank financing, seem the least interested in project finance. They are borrowing selectively to fund acquisitions and refinance existing debt rather than to create new capacity. Also Read: Finance in India has a new bogey called private credit Startups and their founders are far more eager to raise debt, though that’s mostly because venture capital funds have become stingy. Initial public offerings are being delayed in a slowing economy, and equity valuations for many unlisted firms are cooling off. Non-bank financiers, too, are starved for funding. Banks have turned cautious about these firms’ exposure to overleveraged households. This is a perfect scenario for non-traditional lenders—global insurers, asset managers and sovereign wealth funds—to fill in the void left by banks and pocket a cool 18-20% return. Värde Partners, Oaktree Capital Management and Davidson Kempner are among the most aggressive, though everyone from BlackRock to Allianz Global Investors is participating enthusiastically in the deal-making. Local players appear quite miffed. Even though they’re in on many small loans, the foreign money deluge is cutting them out of marquee transactions. Domestic private-credit ventures, especially those affiliated with banks, are also keen to earn high rates of return on capital. But they’re more interested in the return of capital. Some of them have struggled to raise funds because they aren’t seen as bold enough. Also Read: Much more private credit will be needed to feed India’s rapid economic expansion Their foreign rivals, meanwhile, lack neither capital nor courage. As a few prominent Mumbai financiers told me, overseas institutions may be mispricing the true credit risk, which won’t end well. Greed may hurt foreign investors, who will then cry that it’s hard to get repaid in India. Some already are. In 2021, US lenders gave $1.2 billion to Indian entrepreneur Byju Raveendran for his eponymous online education venture, then the country’s most valuable startup. Now Byju’s has collapsed and the money is largely gone. Creditors will be lucky to get even a few cents on the dollar from bankruptcy proceedings in India. And yet, Byju’s is no longer a cautionary tale in a gung-ho market. Creditors are chasing special situations, such as a nephew who needs a hefty loan to buy out an uncle. The other opportunity is in restructuring. Last month, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, a real estate and construction conglomerate, raised $3.4 billion from Deutsche Bank and other investors to refinance previous high-cost debt. This deal, a new record for India’s private-credit market, has raised eyebrows. Although repayment is due in three years, the yield on the zero-coupon bond is as high as 19.75%. The collateral is also tricky. The deal is reportedly backed by about $3.6 billion of real estate and investments in oil and gas. The crown jewel is a 9.2% stake in Tata Sons, valued at roughly $18.6 billion. Also Read: Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate rejigs top deck, appoints dual CEOs But how will value from the holding company of Tata Group, whose listed units are worth $325 billion, ever be realized? Shares in privately held Tata Sons aren’t freely transferable. That’s the official position of the charitable trusts that are its majority shareholders. Maybe investors are betting that the trusts will eventually relent or that they will buy out Shapoorji, the largest minority shareholder. Neither outcome can be predicted with any degree of certainty.The bold bet shines a light on the buccaneering spirit that has taken over India’s nascent private-credit industry. Policymakers would want to see more risk-taking in creation of new assets. India’s new central bank chief has slashed interest rates, reducing the repo rate by a more-than-expected half percentage point on Friday. He has also flooded the financial system with liquidity. But given the cloudy outlook for global trade and local consumption, corporate investment isn’t India Inc’s priority. Swapping assets among one another is. As for the money, there are enough private lenders willing to write checks of $100 million or more. And if they don’t, someone else will. ©Bloomberg The author is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia.

The company’s asset management joint venture with BlackRock had earlier announced its complete leadership team and unveiled a digital-first investment platform. The stock opened higher at ₹305.80 and touched an intraday high of ₹306.85 before paring gains, currently trading below Monday’s closing price of ₹304.25. Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal joint venture between Jio Financial and NYSE-listed BlackRock, named key executives across critical functions. Sid Swaminathan continues as managing director and CEO, while new appointments include Gaurav Nagori as COO, Amit Bhosale as chief risk officer, and Amol Pai as chief technology officer. The company launched early access registration for its digital-first platform, offering educational content on investment fundamentals ahead of the official product launch. Swaminathan indicated the platform would eventually feature investment products incorporating BlackRock’s data-driven investing capabilities. The leadership announcement follows SEBI’s approval for the joint venture, which had initially boosted Jio Financial shares nearly 4 per cent on Monday. However, Tuesday’s trading suggests investor enthusiasm may be cooling despite the strategic developments in the company’s asset management business. The broader market indices continued their fourth consecutive day of gains, adding approximately 35 basis points from Friday’s levels. The stock closed flat on the NSE at ₹302.40.
