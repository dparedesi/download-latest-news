Title: Larry Fink’s BlackRock loses bid to dismiss Texas climate collusion claims

A US judge on Friday largely rejected a request by top asset managers including BlackRock to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Texas and 12 other Republican-led states that said the companies violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states’ lawsuit, that also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard. The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies “created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.” The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets. “By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock said. The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated US antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals. Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws. The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case “half-baked.” But the states’ theories garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds. One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices.

Title: Crypto ETFs See Record $12.8B Inflows in July as Market Rallies to New Highs

Crypto exchange-traded funds on U.S. exchanges recorded their strongest month ever in July, attracting $12.8 billion in net inflows as investor enthusiasm surged alongside rising token prices and optimism around regulation. The data, reported by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas, marks a new monthly record for the sector. The only month that came close was November 2024, when markets rallied on the election of Donald Trump, who was widely viewed as favorable to crypto interests. This time, bullishness may be driven less by politics and more by fundamentals. The crypto market, as tracked by the CoinDesk 20 Index, jumped over 21% in July. Bitcoin BTC$112,243.57 rose 7%, topping a new all-time high of $122,408 during the month. Much of the action centered around BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has quietly grown into a financial giant. With over $86 billion in assets, IBIT now outpaces established ETFs like the S&P 500-tracking IVV and the Russell 2000’s IWM. The fund’s higher fee structure makes it more lucrative for BlackRock than even its flagship equity products. These gains may be just the beginning. Earlier this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved in-kind creation and redemption for all spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a technical change that’s expected to improve efficiency and appeal for institutional investors. For large asset managers, in-kind redemptions let them swap crypto assets without triggering taxable events or facing liquidity crunches—making the funds easier and cheaper to manage at scale.

Title: Hong Kong firm appeals for legal protection of investors as its Panama Ports contract faces lawsuits

A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions has appealed for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company’s contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits HONG KONG -- A subsidiary of a Hong Kong conglomerate entangled in U.S.-China tensions appealed on Friday for legal protection for businesses in Panama after the company's contract over its Panama Canal port assets has been faced with lawsuits in the Central American country. Respect for the rule of law is essential to assure businesses that Panama is a safe place to invest in, Panama Ports Company, under Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings, said in a statement. Panama’s Comptroller General filed two lawsuits on Wednesday, seeking to declare unconstitutional a contract that granted the operation of ports at both ends of the canal to the Hong Kong subsidiary, and to nullify its renewal four years ago, saying it was “abusive” of Panama's interests. In turn, Panama Ports Company said its operations have had a positive impact, from building world-class ports to creating more than 25,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributing billions of balboas — Panama's currency — to the country's economy. It said it wants to work with the government in Panama for a better future. “Regarding the ongoing legal actions, we firmly believe that respect for legal protection and the rule of law are essential in order to provide businesses and investors with the certainty that Panama is a safe country to invest in,” it said. The company operates the ports of Balboa, in the Pacific, and Cristobal, in the Atlantic, under a concession contract approved in 1997 and renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. CK Hutchison is controlled by the family of Li Ka-shing, the southern Chinese city’s richest man. Panama’s comptroller authority in April said that an audit of Panama Ports Company found irregularities in the renewal of the concession. But the company denied allegations that it had failed to pay about $1.2 billion to the Central American country. Panama President José Raúl Mulino said during his weekly news conference on Thursday that he fully supported the comptroller’s case and would await the court’s verdict. “We have all seen what that contract has costed the Panamanian nation over time,” Mulino said without elaborating. He alluded to some sort of public-private partnership for the ports, saying there was a lot of interest from private companies, but that it was in the early stages and provided no details. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan, announced in March, to sell its port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes the U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., also got caught up in tensions between Beijing and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the canal, initially welcomed that plan. However, it apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty, Hutchison said on Monday that it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, which also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. Panama Ports Company said Friday it would communicate with the Panamanian government “at the appropriate time,” affirming that it believes engaging with the government “is vital to discuss the way forward for” the company. Panama's government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press journalist Alma Solís in Panama City contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: US Treasuries Soar As Slower Job Growth Boosts Fed Rate-Cut Bets

Time Published: 2025-08-01T15:13:36Z

Treasuries rallied, with short-term yields posting their biggest drop in a year, after softer US jobs data prompted traders to boost bets that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as soon as next month. Yields on two-year notes tumbled 21 basis points to 3.74%, setting up the biggest drop since last August. Traders fully priced in two rate cuts this year, with an 80% chance of a reduction in September. The move weighed on the dollar and stocks, sending an index of the greenback’s strength down as much as 1% and the S&P 500 nearly 2% lower. The yield moves reflected a dramatic shift in sentiment around the monetary policy outlook, shaped in part by President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates despite elevated inflation expectations. “We would look for the Fed to begin lowering rates in September,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates trading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “It’s somewhat amazing how you can have a sitting Fed Chair intimate the strength in labor one day and receive these numbers a few days later.” Expectations for rate cuts collapsed on Wednesday after Powell’s latest comments on the outlook, less than an hour after Trump said it was his understanding the Fed would cut in September. Friday’s rebound — a seeming validation of Trump’s view and those of two Fed governors he appointed, who dissented from the July 30 decision not to cut rates — may prove historic. The moves were sparked by a report on US labor that showed payrolls increased 73,000 in July. Figures for the prior two months were revised down by nearly 260,000. The jobless rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%. While the pace of hiring has been slowing since April, Powell said low unemployment indicated the jobs market was “in balance” when explaining why policymakers remain on the sidelines. On Friday, Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman expressed concerns that policymakers’ hesitance to lower rates could risk damaging the labor market. The two policymakers voted against the Fed’s decision this week, opting for a quarter-point reduction. The jobs report suggests Waller’s camp “may hold sway or convince more people to come on his side of the argument. And maybe they missed the opportunity in July but it raises the odds you get it in September,” said Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “That is why you are seeing the big move on the front end of the curve.” Friday’s rally reversed Treasuries’ 0.4% loss last month, only the second monthly decline this year. The market is still up 3.4% for the year. “It’s a big beautiful bond market,” said Michael Collins, portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, said on Bloomberg Television. He prefers the two- to 10-year part of the curve where “you don’t have to take a lot of interest-rate risk to get a lot of benefit.” The magnitude of the shift Friday was reflected in high trading volumes in Treasury futures. Some of that activity involved scrapping wagers on shrinking gaps between short- and long-term Treasury yields, which became losers in the rally unleashed by the jobs data, in which those gaps widened as two- to five-year yields saw the biggest declines.

Title: As Tariffs Bite and Jobs Stall, New Interactive Tool Tracks How Much Trump and GOP Are Raising the Cost of Living

Yves here. The lead stories in the press are about Trump’s August 1 tariff salvo, but it’s a little too soon for much in the way of analysis, as opposed to reaction. These tariffs are sure to increase inflation in the US even if some companies accept reductions in their lofty profit levels (corporate profits have been at a sky-high percentage of GDP for years). So we’ll turn to a new tool for estimating increases in living costs after a couple of hot takes on what Trump has wrought. Just after the Trump tariff announcements, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report, and it was a doozy. Not only was the headline number, a mere 73,000 new jobs markedly lower than expectations, and an increase in unemployment to 4.2%, which is not all that bad. But when you look under the hood, it’s much worse. From Bloomberg: Rosenberg of BlackRock says the revisions show a “dramatically different picture” now when you look at the past three months. Before these numbers, the three-month average for payroll gains was 150,000. With the revisions for May and June and the new July figure, the three-month average is now 35,000. That’s entirely different. Oh, and the reason for the big initial overstatement and then the revisions? The so-called birth-death models, which estimates employment growth resulting from new business creation. Those who were following the econoblogosphere in the runup to the financial crisis will recall Barry Ritholtz, Michael Shelock, and then-luminaries who are no longer posting regularly assailing the birth-death model results to be greatly exaggerated, among other reasons due to big falls in construction, and on a scale to distort the overall results. And even before the jobs data hit the wires, some economists were stressing that the tariff increases would hurt demand. From a different Bloomberg account: But at an average of 15%, the world is still facing some of the steepest US tariffs since the 1930s, roughly six times higher than they were a year ago. Trump’s latest volley outlined minimum 10% baseline levies, with rates of 15% or more for countries with trade surpluses with the US. So far, the global economy has held up better than many economists expected after Trump’s initial tariff blitz. A rush to beat the elevated rates spurred a front-loading of exports, aiding many Asian economies and shielding US consumers from price spikes. That could all be about to change. “For the rest of the world, this is a serious demand shock,” Raghuram Rajan, former India central bank governor and chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “You will see a lot of central banks contemplating cutting as the rest of the world slows somewhat in the face of these tariffs.” In other words, in the US, the tariffs will increase stagflationary pressures. That view is confirmed by a report at CNBC: The latest U.S. tariff policy is “still not the end of the story,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said Friday. “President Trump’s latest flurry of tariffs implies that the US effective tariff rate will rise to about 18%, from 2.3% last year,” he noted. That’s higher than expected and carries downside risks for global economic growth projections, as well as some upside risk for U.S. inflation forecasts, Brown said.

Dáte (@svdate) July 31, 2025 Note that Trump’s tariff use of emergency powers to impose tariffs is facing a series of court challenges. Most experts expect Trump to lose. If that happens, it would not only wonderfully discredit Trump but also require a costly refunding of the tariffs collected. With Jerome Powell having sat pat on interest rates, after Trump screamed for a cut, Trump will further increase pressure for the Fed chair’s ouster, which will only increase investor upset. But the odds are not trivial that Powell’s concern, of tariff-induced price increases, will be borne out in the next month or two. And as we have repeatedly pointed out, while a central bank’s interest rate increases can choke economic activity, it does not follow that putting money on sale provides a boost. Most businesses decide to expand operations based on conditions in their market, as in demand and competitor activities. The only enterprises where cheap money in and of itself might lead to incumbents to increase their activities are ones where the cost of money is one of their biggest expenses. Those are mainly financial institutions and financial speculators like real estate developers and hedgies. Common Dreams has publicized a new way to get a better approximation of the real cost of Trump tariffs and other policy measures on household budgets, I hope some of you will road test it, and if is seems useful, encourage people you know, particularly in the press, in politics, or active in social media, to add it to their toolbox. By Julia Conley, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams Six months into U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term, an economic justice group on Thursday unveiled an interactive tool to help Americans put a number on the unmistakable feeling many have reported having about the Republican leader who promised to “make America affordable again”: that costs have in fact gone up under Trump, and that the White House and the GOP are to blame. Using the tool introduced by Unrig Our Economy, people across the U.S. can see exactly how much the price of essentials has gone up in their state, with the advocacy group connecting the dots between the rising cost of living and Trump’s tariffs as well as corporate tax breaks Republicans have relentlessly pushed to pass. According to the “Don’t Inflate Our Plates” tool, the price of beef in Texas has gone up nearly 47% since the early days of Trump’s second term, while eggs cost $3.19 more than they did before Trump took office. In California, eggs now cost over $5.00 more than they did before Trump’s second term, based on “historical trends, real-time supplier data, and market analysis” that Unrig Our Economy examined. Trump & congressional Republicans claim that food prices will come down. While they raise prices – we pay. 🚨So we built a brand-new site to hold them accountable:https://t.co/h3lVqz2Z6A tracks food prices in real time — and exposes how the GOP's policies are raising costs. pic.twitter.com/YKvzMV683Z — Unrig Our Economy (@UnrigOurEconomy) July 31, 2025 Unrig Our Economy gained some of its data from Kroger’s pricing data, finding that in states with Kroger stores, the price of beef has gone up between 16% and 72%, with the biggest price hikes in Alaska and Utah. Egg prices in particular were a talking point for Trump during his presidential campaign, but they’ve risen in many states where Kroger operates, with customers in Michigan—where the president won in 2024—paying 58% more for eggs. “Trump and Republicans in Congress are singlehandedly inflating the cost of everyday items that Americans rely on,” said Leor Tal, campaign director for Unrig Our Economy. “While billionaires and corporations cash in on Republican-backed tax breaks, working-class families are left paying higher prices for eggs, coffee, and more.” Unrig Our Economy pointed to reporting on Trump’s tariffs, more of which are set to be announced Friday, with the president expected to impose rates up to 50% on some imports. As Common Dreams reported this week, the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative found that just as corporate executives used labor shortages and supply chain disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic as cover to keep prices high even after those problems were resolved, many are now using tariffs as a justification for price increases. “We certainly welcome a reduction in the Chinese tariffs, but we’ll be announcing a price increase here regardless of any changes of the Chinese tariffs over the next week or two to go into effect in June,” the CEO of one footwear brand said in a recent earnings call. Unrig Our Economy pointed to recent polling that showed Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s tariffs, including 47% of Republican voters. The Trump administration has also made a number of regulatory moves benefiting corporations that aim to take as much money from working families’ household budgets as possible, including a push for the cancellation of a Biden-era Federal Trade Commission rule allowing consumers to easily cancel subscriptions; the FTC’s decision to drop a lawsuit challenging price discrimination by PepsiCo; and the commission’s move shutting down public comments on corporate pricing tactics. The interactive tool was unveiled weeks after the president signed into law his sweeping domestic policy and budget package, which includes the largest cuts to public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in history, increases monthly payments for student loan borrowers under repayment assistance plans, and hands out $117 billion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans while providing just $77 billion in cumulative savings to the bottom 60% of earners. As Unrig Our Economy unveiled its tool allowing Americans to see exactly how their household budgets are being impacted under the Trump administration, the Century Foundation (TCF) and Morning Consult released the results of a poll in which they asked more than 2,000 people in June how they were being affected by the high cost of living over the past six months. More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living. More than 4 in 5 Americans said they were concerned about the price of groceries, and nearly half were concerned about their ability to pay their rent or mortgage. Forty-eight percent said they would have difficulty paying an unexpected $500 bill, like a home repair or medical bill, without borrowing or using credit, and nearly 20% said it would be “very difficult” to make the payment. Even among households with incomes over $100,000, more than a third said they would have a hard time meeting the surprise expense without dipping into savings or using credit cards—suggesting that these households are using a large proportion of their relatively comfortable monthly income for essentials “While the federal government tears down programs such as Medicaid and food assistance and federal regulators give the green light to companies to rip off consumers, families are being forced to construct their own safety nets from a web of risky financial practices,” said TCF. Unrig the Economy said that with Don’t Inflate Our Plates, the group is calling out “the Republican-backed policies that got us here” and demanding “that Congress put working people first.” Saw an article in the last couple of days warning that Social Security Staffing cuts might threaten Cost-of-Living Adjustments- no one there to analyze infaltion. Someone commented that there was plenty of data available everywhere. This looks interesting. Bill Maher, the Nobel Prize winning economist, declared he was wrong about the inflationary effects of Trump’s tariffs. The effort and study into Maher’s advanced degrees must have displaced the simple Econ 101 exhortations about lagging effects of policies on the real economy. A small additional point for Mr. Maher: the economy is NOT the Stock Market and the three major Indices reported breathlessly every night on Broadcast news. I’m sorry but Common Dreams is mostly apology for the D faction – it’s all the bad ol’ Rs. They are proponents of the Bipartisan status quo. The D faction has done nothing but vote for kleptocracy, anti-labor, pro-finance, genocide, war and everyone turns a blind eye to the rampant institutional corruption in both the so-called public and private sectors. “… More than half of respondents said “billionaires, corporations, and congressional Republicans have made their lives harder,” and 60% said the Trump administration is to blame for the higher cost of living…” So whaddya gonna do? Vote D? Arrghh The same old garbage for decades got us where we are now. The US is an oligarchy, let’s stop pretending otherwise, the charades have become tiresome and irritating. The judicial branch make a mockery of the law and the constitution, the legislative branch are openly and legally bribed, and the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew are accelerating the rot. Also, when are folks going to see that the Emperor has lost his marbles? Dude is showing signs of physical and mental decline. Even the so-called liberal outlets don’t see it. I guess late-stage empire produces deep corruption, kleptocracy, corruption, kakistocracy and war. Don’t need to say “so-called liberal” as liberal is an enforcer of the status quo as well as being Far-right wing. This is ad hominem and a violation of our site Policies. You don’t disprove the validity of the remark. And inequality and immiseration of the poor is increasing enormously under Trump. No, it was an attack on the credibility of Common Dreams. As in, if the witness is unreliable, that is grounds to doubt the testimony. Ad hominem is an attack on the messenger unrelated to the message. Credibility, however, is always relevant. Jeez Louise, you fail as a pedant. No, ad hominem is not about testimony. It is the logical fallacy of trying to dispute the validity of an argument by attacking the party that said it. You might try using the modern invention of a search engine rather than tout your erroneous beliefs. Ad hominem (Latin for ‘to the person’), short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than the substance of the argument itself. This avoids genuine debate by creating a diversion often using a totally irrelevant, but often highly charged attribute of the opponent’s character or background. The most common form of this fallacy is “A” makes a claim of “fact”, to which “B” asserts that “A” has a personal trait, quality or physical attribute that is repugnant thereby going off-topic, and hence “B” concludes that “A” has their “fact” wrong – without ever addressing the point of the debate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem Your comment about credibility is also false. Even parties with erratic track records can make accurate observations. That is why you must address the argument on its merits. That’s right. The Democratic Party knows that all it has to do to regain power is wait for Trump to self-destruct. They have no intention of creating plans that would improve the lives of ordinary people. JonnyJames is also wrong in his depiction of Common Dreams. They are Sandernistas. They have often criticized Team D from the soft left. I did apologize in advance, and apologize for sounding offensive.I take your point, and I do admit that I am angry about the political situation in general. We can quibble about Common Dreams, they do post some good material, however I am overly sensitive about Rs this, Ds that at this point. It all seems so superficial and lost in the forest for the trees. My observations are not necessarily ad hom polemics, given the context. I did engage in ad hom in “the Idiot Emperor and the Kakistocrat Krew”. But I have heard many analysts we all follow say very similar things. I have read CD for years, and I feel that they have done the old bait and switch routine every election. It is not ad hom to say that. The old, “hold your nose and vote D” the lesser evil and all that. From what I have read here over the years, we all agree on the main point: partisan politics is a dead-end. The US has no functioning democracy and can be seen as an oligarchy. 1. Common Dreams very often posts about the US as an oligarchy but (like pretty much everyone) they have no or unrealistic ideas. So I don’t agree with your characterization 2. Common Dreams did not endorse Harris, which for a reader-supported venue generally aligned with the Sandernista left was pretty bold. They still said Trump was awful and dissed voting third party, but throwing cold water on Kamala would at the margin lead more readers to vote for Stein or another third party candidate. See: https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/we-can-t-endorse-harris-but-we-oppose-trump-and-voting-third-party-is-a-mistake I know am being unrealistic in my expectations, but the implicit assumption is if you don’t vote 3rd party, then one must “vote” for the D (or R) candidate. (in our FPTP electoral system) So although they did not explicitly endorse Harris, they did not endorse an alternative candidate, thus the endorsement was by default. The way electoral issues are framed are a bit disappointing to me, but that’s just me. Also, on foreign affairs, I have been disappointed with stuff like this https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/putin-russia-gas-ukraine-war https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/trump-vance-putin https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/02/20/vladimir-putin-authentic-leader-republican-party No, they were endorsing not voting at all. Or not voting for a Presidential candidate but voting down ticket. That is where their logic goes. They might not have been able to admit that to themselves. Thank you for hearing me out, I should have articulated the fine points in my earlier post. ‘Republicans against Trump @RpsAgainstTrump Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee to the U.S. With Trump’s 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, your coffee is about to get a lot more expensive. (Prices have already jumped over 15% in recent months.) All because he wants to protect his corrupt friend Bolsonaro. Insane.’ The whole thing is asinine but I wonder if Washington will privately agree to look the other way if, for example, Brazilian coffee was shipped to say Mexico who then sold it to the US for a marked up price. If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee, the Trump regime might think it wise to go this way to take some off the pressure form these price increases. And this could happen for other goods as well. Trouble is his admin is shot through with ideologues who might rebel at the idea. “If there was a mini-revolt over the price of coffee…” As one NC commenter recently stated, “Coffee is not a matter of life or death, it’s much more important than that.” Also see Michael Pollan on caffeine and capitalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHW7Ly8k0X8&t=7s Might one then infer that a lack of caffeine will bring about socialism, inefficiencies due to acquiescent lassitude, something else entirely? Does the price of eggs have anything to do with tariffs, or just with bird flu and the culling of birds? I’ve no doubt the tariffs will have significant impact, but the eggs are one of the only concrete [ie non-political] statistics in the linked article. TOM: A google search found the USA is importing eggs from Turkey and South Korea. Other sources being considered include Europe and Brazil. It is difficult to imagine large eggs being more than $5 doz anywhere in the USA, but well, California is “special”. Before Covid they were 49¢ per doz here. But for a few weeks now (in Wisconsin) they have been holding at $2.71 at Aldi (and I think that is high). Here on Cape Cod, they are $6.99 and up a dozen. Massachusetts has cage free laws. Where are policy proposals that stand a chance of enactment to reverse the rise in interest costs? What will those mean to you, me and our friends, neighbors and everybody? After absorbing increase in premiums on auto insurance and housing insurance, I’m waiting patiently on the retrospective analysis of what Did Happen the last four years between mid year 2021 to January 2025. This isn’t what about the other side necessarily but clowns like a Krugman or Noah Smith were crowing loud and proud on the wonders by those Biden administration economic policies. Mainstream economists deserve their scorn and this cheerleading is readily available to find from previous years. My last six month auto premium finally flattened out, or unchanged. Year to date the average price on a gallon of gas is practically unchanged as well. Feel welcome to highlight items that have increased or will be increasing in that basket of theoretical groceries for a family of four. But personally my personal cost of living increased by roughly 25% to 35% during that aforementioned time frame until early 2025. The cost of natural gas from PG&E went up about 40 percent in the last year. Locally grown organic eggs are still around $10 per dozen. That’s down from $12 from a few months ago. Our auto insurance premium actually went down a whopping $1.66 per month. Alas, our business work van with tools of the trade was recently stolen, so if Farmer’s runs true to form they’ll get back their buck sixty-six and a whole lot more come renewal time. Trade van thefts are rampant here no doubt due to harder economic times, and our town seems able to afford only 1 police officer per 10,000 residents, which is 1/3 the national average. Good times! Forgot to add, our city’s parsimony when it comes to citizen security services is rather baffling in that we are hardly a community of poors, over the last few years under state pressure we’ve added thousands of new residential units, and our state and local taxes are some of the highest in the nation. PG&E, aren’t they a notorious and poorly run energy utilities company on the west coast I wish to suggest? I don’t do organic anything to be honest, so the best of my egg purchases in a convenient dozen currently run about $3 per dozen for a store branded carton. My personal experience is just that, of course within my daily or monthly consumption patterns. A simple anecdote from a supposedly “Simple Man!” We went from high times under Biden and just now people ( not specifically to you or anyone here ) recognize the cost of living increased dramatically since 2021….oh come on. Would a Harris administration really have made marked improvements or changes in a few short months? I think, in that hypothetical , most media would’ve extended a grace period but that is just me being a cynical American citizen. I had 3 Bidenomics sightings yesterday, people walking on the road in this rural area where if you’re doing that, you’re in a bad way. What looked like a couple and two individuals. I got lucky with auto insurance this go around, the price went down slight; and I negotiated a better deal with Spectrum, to my shock, sans TV bundle. Just Internet-only now, and for about $16 less per month. I was shocked. Things were deteriorating even prior to our surprise jobs number today. I’m an owner of a thirty year old wholesale specialty food and spice business. We import and then manufacture, package items you cannot get onshore, or often times, spices etc that literally cannot be grown here. Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning. It’s the whim of the king and whether someone was mean to his bestie decision making. But small businesses like mine have very little runway to get through this environment. Everyone I know is getting more convinced (perhaps a bit of wish casting) that the courts will strike down the tariffs. They have already lost in US Trade Court by unanimous decision. The US Appeals Court yesterday seemed very skeptical of the governments position. I expect the decision to be the same as the Trade Court. SCOTUS? Not so sure. And how long must we wait? Or if the decision ultimately doesn’t go his way, will he even abide by it? In the meantime the admin is blowing up businesses, jobs, inflation. I see it up close everyday. “Yet these inputs are being tariffed seemingly with zero thought, foresight, planning.” You’re dead wrong: it’s a great big beautiful plan and you and I ain’t in it. Hey, us not being in, IS the plan. Saw a published US unemployment stat for the last quarter that youth unemployment had risen from 9.2% to 10%, which qualifies the headline rate. Trump didn’t like todays jobs report so he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer. https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/trump-orders-firing-bls-commissioner-weak-jobs-report-rcna222531 I struggle to visualize what is the outcome Trump and his cronies expect from this. Tariffs are only a good threat so long as the US market is good; now, 342 million people is nothing to scoff at, but as immiseration sets apace and companies are forced to diversify buyers (after all, the only reliable expectations scenario for Trump is that he does things on a dime and can cause ruinous losses based on whims) how relevant will the US market keep on being? Furthermore, in a pure balance-of-payments matter, the US dollar as the global means of payment, store of value, etc. necessitates US deficits, as is well known. The attempt (meagre as it may be) to induce surpluses would imply catastrophic deflation, as too few dollars are available for world investment/commerce needs, and the obvious impossibility to industrialize (I don’t expect Trump and his ilk to follow the Credit Theory of Money, though). On the other hand, the deflationary pressures could well make everyone who is holding treasuries and the like to cash out in order to benefit from the currency arbitrage, causing raising yields, an incapability to refinance the US debts, and stock and commodity prices to soar (since the dollars would have to be put somewhere that isn’t more US treasuries). Any way out of this dilemma that I can see is to cause either inflationary ruin or bankruptcy (and maybe both). Is there anyone thinking of the consequences? A large cause of all that US currency floating around in the world is due to the country’s five-decades of consecutive trade deficits where it has paid for imports with US cash/debt. When the US had a trade surplus, other countries would want to borrow US money in order to buy American production. If the US was competitive in international trade, other countries would buy US goods with the dollars they are holding reducing the amount of US money floating around out there. Increased manufacturing in the US would also mean faster economic growth, more jobs and more tax revenue – this would reduce the rather huge 6-8% of GDP federal budget deficits that the country is experiencing. Well, it looks a bit vaporwareish at this point. I can go to the linked website and compare the price of beef at Kroger’s for different states, which I guess is something. Also, I’m sorry if this is also ad hominem, (at least not a direct criticism) but hello! 1997 would like their web designer back . . . I suspect that people are underestimating the economic cliff dead ahead due to the front-loading of US imports (to avoid tariffs). The front-loading both delayed and will soon enhance the effects of the tariffs on PRICES and REAL ACTIVITY and TRADE. Now that 18% average US tariffs are permanent, US imports will not only decrease in an amount consistent with an increase in the average tariff from 2.3% to 18%, US imports will also decrease an even larger amount to make up for the excess inventories that were previously imported to front run the increased tariffs. This sudden tremendous decrease in US imports will sharply decrease global real activity in the second half of 2025. Similarly US businesses will go from having abundant low-cost front-loaded inventories to suddenly having scarce high-cost inventories. Prices will increase dramatically and rapidly in the US in the second half, even as global GDP plummets. Data point: 3-4 months ago I paid $13.99 for a 2.5 pound bag of Costco’s French roast whole coffee beans. The following month it was $116.99, and ten days ago I paid $19.99. Regardless of the beans’ origin that is a coffee Brazilian. I’m assuming you mean $16.99 not $169.99. I just read this article right before your comment, coincidentally: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/33822282/coffee-prices-plunge-as-supply-concerns-ease I don’t see how the price action downwards makes sense on the tariff exemption news? It was caused by a lack of supply due to environmental factors. A reduction in tariffs would only increase US consumption of it. Ive been talking to a lot of coffee roasters recently and one mentioned that Robusta will likely come back into favour as Arabica becomes harder to grow due to climate change. He mentioned that Arabica became the popular bean partly because it was seen as a “premium” bean in the first place. Anecdotally, my friend recently brought back some Robusta from Vietnam and it had amazing flavour. I feel like it’s underrated, at least here in Canada. Oops! You are correct. It was $16.99.

BlackRock's ETHA commands Ethereum ETF inflow surge, capturing 78% of total investments. Spot Ethereum ETFs had their 20th straight day of net inflows as of July 31, the longest streak of positive flows since their debut. According to data from SoSoValue, these funds attracted a combined $17 million in net inflows on the day. This sustained momentum has pushed total inflows across the nine spot ETH ETFs to nearly $5.4 billion, significantly higher than the cumulative flows seen in previous months. In fact, this month’s inflows are approximately three times greater than the second-highest month since launch. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF, ETHA, led the charge with $4.2 billion in monthly inflows, accounting for 78% of all capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the pace of growth, calling it “wild.” He noted that if Bitcoin ETFs didn’t exist, ETHA would be the fastest ETF in history to reach $10 billion in assets, beating previous records by nearly 2x. These consistent gains have significantly boosted the total net assets under management. The spot Ethereum ETFs now hold $21.52 billion in net assets, representing 5% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Why ethereum is suddenly beating bitcoin
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-vs-bitcoin-eth-btc-price-crypto-rally-spot-etfs-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-01T09:30:02Z
Full Content:
The world's most popular cryptocurrency is being outdone by its closest competitor in the last few weeks. Bitcoin has rallied to record highs this year, but its more recent performance has lagged behind ethereum. Ethereum's price is up 54% over the last month, compared to bitcoin's 10% increase. Zack Shapiro, an attorney at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told BI there were a handful of reasons ethereum has pulled ahead. "I think a lot of it is that it's a speculation trade," he said of ethereum's latest rally. "Long term, we have to see." Here are some of the things Shapiro thinks are driving the fervor for ethereum. Markets are enthusiastic about stablecoins after the passing of the GENIUS Act, the Senate's landmark bill that sets the terms surrounding stablecoin regulation and opens the door for more issuers to mint their own fiat-backed tokens. Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, and other top stablecoins on the crypto market are issued on the Ethereum network. "People think that stablecoins might proliferate a lot more. Maybe some of those stablecoins will be on ethereum," Shapiro said of the market's psychology. Retail giants like Walmart and Amazon are reportedly considering their own stablecoins, and using the tokens for retail payments would be a "big breakthrough" for the market, according to Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk. Shapiro says institutional investors have also recently offered ethereum ETFs, another factor driving inflows into the token. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are among the firms that now offer a spot ethereum ETF. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF is up 48.9% over the last month. Fidelity's Ethereum Fund is up 33.1%, while Grayscale's Ethereum Mini Trust ETF is up 49.2% over that time frame. Cumulative spot ethereum ETF volumes rose to $123.5 billion as of Wednesday, according to data compiled by The Block. Corporate crypto treasuries have also proliferated in 2025, and recently, many have been scooping up ethereum. Bitmine Immersion, one such crypto treasury, said last week it raised its ethereum holdings to over $2 billion. The Ether Machine, another crypto treasury firm, said on Wednesday that its total ethereum holdings had climbed to $56.9 million. "Those vehicles are out there buying ethereum. And so that could also be additional buy-pressure that's moving up the price," Shapiro said. Shapiro isn't certain that the momentum will last for ethereum. He believes much of the hype for the coin in recent weeks has to do with excitement and uncertainty over ethereum's potential catalysts. The crypto's rally could lose steam once more regulatory details are solidified, he said. He pointed in particular to the CLARITY Act, the crypto market structure bill that's awaiting approval in Congress. "Is the market structure bill going to pass? Are these sort of crypto primitives going to find product market fit in the market? And then is Ethereum, as opposed to other blockchain systems, going to be the winner from that?" Shapiro said. "I would personally probably sell the news." Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Check out Business Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges Jump to

Title: Oculis Upsized Loan Facility to Access up to CHF 100 million

Time Published: 2025-08-01T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
August 01, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) (“Oculis” or the “Company”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announced that it has amended its loan facility (the “Amended Loan Agreement”) with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (the “Lender”). The Amended Loan Agreement replaces the prior loan agreement between Oculis and the Lender dated May 29, 2024, and the upsized structure will provide CHF 75.0 million in borrowing capacity (which may be increased to up to CHF 100.0 million) (the “Loan”). The Loan comprises tranches 1, 2 and 3, in the amounts of CHF 25.0 million each, as well as an additional loan of up to CHF 25.0 million, which may be made available by the Lender to Oculis on mutually agreed terms. No amounts were drawn at signing. Access to this additional capital offers significant financial flexibility beyond Oculis’ current cash reserves as the Company moves toward upcoming key milestones across all three core assets: regulatory discussions with the FDA on three indications investigated with Privosegtor (OCS-05) for acute optic neuritis, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis (NAION), and treatment of acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) during 2H 2025; initiation of Licaminlimab (OCS-02) Phase 2/3 trial for dry eye disease in 2H 2025; initiation of Privosegtor (OCS-05) Phase 2/3 trial for acute optic neuritis in 1H 2026; OCS-01 Phase 3 DIAMOND trials’ topline results in Q2 2026, and if positive, its first NDA filing in 2H 2026. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, said, “We are pleased to have upsized our previous loan agreement with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, which expands an instrument allowing enhanced flexibility to ensure the future financial and operational strength of Oculis. Our current robust cash position provides runway into early 2028, which is further strengthened by the loan facility, as we remain focused on advancing our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing transformative treatments to those who need them most.” About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

August 01, 2025 04:00 ET | Source: Oculis Holding AG Oculis Holding AG ZUG, Switzerland, Aug. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oculis Holding AG (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) (“Oculis” or the “Company”), a global biopharmaceutical company focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announced that it has amended its loan facility (the “Amended Loan Agreement”) with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock (the “Lender”). The Amended Loan Agreement replaces the prior loan agreement between Oculis and the Lender dated May 29, 2024, and the upsized structure will provide CHF 75.0 million in borrowing capacity (which may be increased to up to CHF 100.0 million) (the “Loan”). The Loan comprises tranches 1, 2 and 3, in the amounts of CHF 25.0 million each, as well as an additional loan of up to CHF 25.0 million, which may be made available by the Lender to Oculis on mutually agreed terms. No amounts were drawn at signing. Access to this additional capital offers significant financial flexibility beyond Oculis’ current cash reserves as the Company moves toward upcoming key milestones across all three core assets: regulatory discussions with the FDA on three indications investigated with Privosegtor (OCS-05) for acute optic neuritis, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis (NAION), and treatment of acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) during 2H 2025; initiation of Licaminlimab (OCS-02) Phase 2/3 trial for dry eye disease in 2H 2025; initiation of Privosegtor (OCS-05) Phase 2/3 trial for acute optic neuritis in 1H 2026; OCS-01 Phase 3 DIAMOND trials’ topline results in Q2 2026, and if positive, its first NDA filing in 2H 2026. Riad Sherif, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Oculis, said, “We are pleased to have upsized our previous loan agreement with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, which expands an instrument allowing enhanced flexibility to ensure the future financial and operational strength of Oculis. Our current robust cash position provides runway into early 2028, which is further strengthened by the loan facility, as we remain focused on advancing our portfolio of differentiated assets and bringing transformative treatments to those who need them most.” About Oculis Oculis is a global biopharmaceutical company (Nasdaq: OCS; XICE: OCS) focused on innovations addressing ophthalmic and neuro-ophthalmic conditions with significant unmet medical needs.

Title: Institutional Money Is Moving Into The Ethereum Ecosystem; Here Are The Top ETH Token Price Predictions

Recently, there has been an unprecedented influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, with data showing billions in record-breaking monthly inflows. The Ethereum ETF spot approval and rising DeFi dominance have continued leading the way as institutional money keeps flowing in. However, with the inflow comes a surge in attention to Ethereum top tokens such as AAVE, Remittix, and Ethena. But with these tokens seeing renewed pump, here is a look into Ethena price direction and what AAVE price prediction looks like this month. The Ethereum ETF has continued extending its rising Ethereum ETF inflow with a record 17-day extension. Ethereum’s global reach with the ETF has also continued pushing the token closer to a new bull breakout as traders eye $4,000. However, fundamental factors have proven instrumental in the rising Ethereum price as new announcements keep adding to the large inflow. One of the latest updates analysts are eyeing lately is the news of Deutsche Bank’s tokenization platform on Ethereum. Therefore, with new projects such as the BlackRock BUIDL fund and Sharplink Gaming, experts remain bullish on rising inflows to Ethereum. Top AAVE price prediction speculates a 100% rise before November this year. The bullish season is a factor experts believe could boost the AAVE price as Ethereum leads the altseason. Moreover, as institutional traders continue moving millions into Ethereum, AAVE price prediction continues to stand stronger. However, while a whale withdrawal last week gave the AAVE price prediction a shakeup, new Metamask integration is renewing the hope. This is a new AAVE Price prediction suggests a potential high of over $500 before the end of the year. Ethena price surge joined the ranks of the major breakouts last week, with a bullish stretch recording over 140% in the last 30 days. The Ethereum rising inflow is projected to see the Ethena price hit a new high this year, with a target $1.50. The Ethena price setup shows 3 bullish candles breaking out above the 50 SMA on the weekly chart, fueling bullish sentiment. A growth in Ethereum staking yield is projected to see Ethena price rise to $4 before mid-2026. Remittix is another Ethereum token growing to be the best this year, with utility and adoption. While Remittix is new to the ecosystem, its fast climb in the last few weeks shows it could soon take over the market. This includes a breakout surge in presale already hitting $17.9 million, making it the best crypto presale of 2025. The Remittix solution is not feeding off hype, but rather on a solidly built utility that analysts believe could be the future of crypto payment. Below are some of the features making Remittix stand out at the moment: With Remittix set to launch in the coming weeks, experts forecast up to 30x in breakout after hitting the exchange.

Title: Ireland’s Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald: ‘We want to leave a legacy from the World Cup’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/01/cliodhna-moloney-macdonald-we-want-to-leave-a-legacy-from-the-world-cup-in-terms-of-our-performance-and-how-we-are-supported-by-the-irish-people/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Two days out from the first of the two warm-up games before the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England, Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald is reflective. With 43 Ireland caps to date, she is one of the players lining out against Scotland on Saturday in Cork who was involved in the home World Cup back in 2017. “I think a lot has changed,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “The tournament structure has changed hugely. The numbers that go have changed hugely. Women’s rugby has advanced a lot. So while I might have experience – and people will be asking me questions anyway – that’s not World Cup relevant. “I’ve been around a long time, I do know a lot of players from other countries and how they play. I’ve experienced playing against a lot of other countries, even at a club level, like playing over in England [with Exeter Chiefs], I would experience playing against a lot of these teams and players from these teams.” The landscape of women’s sport and women’s rugby has exploded since 2017, and Irish women’s rugby has been on an emotional rollercoaster, with more lows than highs in that time. Through all this, the support of family, friends, and fans has remained consistent. “[The 2017 World Cup] was a huge occasion, and getting to play in front of all your family and friends, it was amazing. That’s probably something that will remain the same. We’re as close as we could be to a home World Cup so the support element will hopefully be huge.” Saturday’s game at Musgrave Park and the following Saturday’s encounter with Canada at Ravenhill have been organised to give fans a chance to see off the team in style before they set up base in England. “People can fly over from Shannon, Dublin and wherever, and there’s lots of games all over the country,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “We want to give our team a great send-off and prepare ourselves as best as possible. But we also want to get people behind us a little bit. So performance is the main goal, but we do want to feel a little bit of support and love from the Irish people before we head off.” Managing those small things will be critical for this weekend’s first warm-up game against Scotland, who beat Ireland in the final Six Nations game earlier this year. “We were disappointed at the end of the Six Nations to lose that game, it’s not one that we should have lost, we feel,” admits Moloney-MacDonald. “We’ll want to put those things right, just for our performance, like the things we got wrong that day. We want to tidy up on them. But it is more about performing as a team in the way that we want to play and the way that we want to approach this World Cup.” Every game and every opponent is different, but the guiding goal is the same: getting to Twickenham for the World Cup final. “We know what we need to do at each stage but we’re not overestimating; this week is about Scotland, next week about Canada. Then it’s selection and getting there and then it’s each game at a time, and the pool games are each going to be very challenging in their own way.” Having the World Cup so close, and hopefully performing well, could help achieve another of the team’s goals: to fuel the growth of the game in Ireland. “We do have our goals individually and for each game, and obviously we need to get there first. But obviously the overall plan and strategy and everything is about growing the game in Ireland and that’s always in the back of our mind. “When we travel over to England, the lucky ones that get to go, we want to bring the sport with us, but we also want to leave a legacy from this World Cup in terms of our performance and how we are supported by the Irish people.” IRELAND (v Scotland, World Cup warm-up, Saturday, Musgrave Park, 2pm): Méabh Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Nancy McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs)*, Eve Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); Siobhán McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); Eimear Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), Sam Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby) (capt); Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht)*, Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster).

Share this article Seven major asset managers – Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Canary, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares – on Thursday submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the SEC for their proposed Solana (SOL) ETFs. The amendments represent the firms’ continued efforts to secure regulatory nod to expand their crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products currently available to US investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and ETF Store President Nate Geraci note that the revised filings demonstrate active engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers. Not really… but clearly dialogue w/ SEC and issuers are refining prospectus language. Gotta think fees in neighborhood of btc & eth ETFs. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 31, 2025 Industry experts project a 95% probability of SEC approval for spot Solana ETFs, though prospects are unclear for products incorporating staking features. Meanwhile, asset managers like BlackRock are seeking regulatory approval to incorporate staking into their existing spot Ethereum ETFs. Geraci suggests staked Ether ETFs could receive the next regulatory approval, following the SEC’s recent authorization of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Several organizations, including Jito Labs, VanEck, Bitwise, the Solana Policy Institute, and Multicoin Capital, are advocating for the SEC to permit liquid staking in Solana-based ETPs. Liquid staking enables tokens to maintain liquidity while being staked, providing benefits such as enhanced capital efficiency, lower ETP operational costs, and expanded security and investor options.

Title: SEC Chair Discusses American Leadership in Digital Finance — Project Crypto
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/08/01/sec-chair-discusses-american-leadership-in-digital-finance-project-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T04:01:15Z
Full Content:
It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. *** Today, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.”[1] But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations.[2] In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. *** In the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America.[3] It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years… Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded.[4] Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries.[5] The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade.[6] But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate.[7] So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges.[8] So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.”[9] I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”[10] Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street.[11] Now, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising.[12] As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “Howey test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain.[13] He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology. These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits,[14] but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties.[15] Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets. As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value.[16] I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today.[17] The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.”[18] I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structure create a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month.[19] This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.”[20] I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.”[21] Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643.[22] I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. *** As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today. I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Title: SOS — Save Our Shipping: Trump must break China’s chokehold on global trade
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/sos-trump-must-break-chinas-global-shipping-chokehold/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T23:59:58Z

A high-stakes deal that would give an American company a major role in running dozens of strategically crucial global ports is now in limbo — as China aggressively demands a stake. The United States cannot let that happen. US asset manager BlackRock and its partners are vying for 43 of the world’s most important shipping ports, including the two that straddle the Panama Canal. The seller is C.K. Hutchison, a major Hong Kong operator that is one of China’s “big three” port giants — and the only one not owned outright by the Chinese government. Prying these ports from China’s oversight is a critical move for both US national security and the global economy. Now the Chinese Communist Party is trying to block the deal, unless its state-owned COSCO joins the buyers’ group and gains veto rights over port operations. Alarmingly, all three main parties are reportedly open to letting that happen, apparently thinking that a compromised deal is better than no deal at all. But with all that’s at stake, President Donald Trump should use every tool available — starting with the ongoing US-China trade talks — to push the original deal through and keep COSCO out. The 43 ports that Hutchison seeks to sell would launch a global liberation from oppressive Chinese surveillance and control. If the plan falls through — or if it’s altered to add COSCO to the ownership group — China could tighten its grip on the global shipping system, by replacing a Beijing-influenced company with a Beijing-controlled one. While the media has dubbed this the “Panama Canal deal,” it’s actually much bigger. The canal, a vital artery that runs through the center of the western hemisphere, is certainly critical — but many of the other ports involved in the deal are equally so. For example, this deal would include a port inside the Malacca Strait, the only direct maritime pathway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It sees 90,000 ships and $3.5 trillion worth of global trade every year. Hutchison is also looking to sell five ports that it owns on both sides of the Suez Canal, the preferred maritime commercial route between the Asian and European markets. About 12% of global trade, $1 trillion a year, passes through Suez. As China’s purchases of sanctioned Iranian oil draw greater US scrutiny, Hutchison’s four ports on the southern side of the Strait of Hormuz are also critical. Nearly all Iranian oil must pass through the strait, along with oil and gas from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. In Europe, Hutchison controls 13 ports that act as a key entry point for Chinese goods into the European Union. The original deal would reduce China’s port foothold on the continent — and the geopolitical influence that comes with it. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Like all major commercial deals, this one is complicated. Apart from the two Panama Canal ports, BlackRock would retain 20% ownership of the remaining facilities; its partner, Europe-based Mediterranean Shipping Corp., would control 70%, with Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owning the rest. Meanwhile, China’s power in global shipping is massive. China produces 95% of world shipping containers and all of the refrigerated ones. Ports around the world are plugged into China’s logistical software platform, LOGINK, which tracks sensitive trade, market, maritime and passenger data. Huawei’s “Smart Port” 5G telecommunication towers provide Wi-Fi — and ready surveillance capacity — at ports worldwide. A Chinese state-owned company makes more than 70% of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes (and 80% of the cranes used in America) — a major risk, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, which has alleged those cranes may be engaging in covert surveillance on behalf of the CCP. Adding state-owned COSCO to ports deal would give the CCP the power to veto any attempts to replace Huawei towers, LOGINK systems, Chinese cranes or other tools that may already be spying on behalf of the state. With BlackRock’s minority interest in the vast bulk of these ports, replacing a private Chinese company with a state-owned one is even worse for the United States than the status quo. Breaking China’s maritime monopoly is urgent. At the same time, America’s economic leverage has never been higher. As Beijing trumps up patently absurd anti-monopoly investigations to stall or scuttle the BlackRock-MSC deal, the United States should Trump right back. He must make the choice clear: Access to American markets cannot continue unless Beijing releases its maritime monopoly.

Title: Biden Aide Mike Donilon Claims He Had No Clue About Autopen

Mike Donilon, a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden, told congressional investigators he had no knowledge of the autopen or its use, a source familiar with his testimony told the Daily Caller. Donilon appeared Thursday before the House Oversight Committee as part of Chairman James Comer’s probe into Biden’s mental fitness and the administration’s use of the autopen. He had advised Biden since 1981, serving as a pollster, strategist and media consultant during Biden’s Senate tenure, according to his Harvard Institute of Politics biography. (RELATED: ‘A Great Candidate For Republicans’: James Comer Has Fun Predicting Kamala’s Future Job Prospects) Mike Donilon is in the hot seat today. Let’s get some answers. https://t.co/vN39PdlGZ1 — Oversight Committee (@GOPoversight) July 31, 2025 Donilon told the committee he stood to make $8 million from Biden’s reelection bid — half already paid out, with the rest contingent on a 2024 victory. He reportedly downplayed concerns over Biden’s debate performance, saying critics in the media and on Capitol Hill had overreacted. He conceded the former president’s presence was sometimes diminished and that he occasionally stumbled over words, but expressed frustration with the public’s fixation on Biden’s appearance. Donilon reiterated he had no knowledge of the autopen or how it was used. He previously served as counselor to then-Vice President Biden and led strategy, polling, messaging, advertising and speechwriting for Biden’s 2020 and 2024 campaigns.

Dean Phillips previously described Donilon as one of the “ringleaders” trying to keep Biden in the 2024 presidential race, warning that figures like him are motivated by “self-preservation.” The Chairman of BlackRock Investment Institute (BlackRock’s global think tank & influence shop), who won the CIA’s Director Award and played a leading role in NATO enlargement, is on the advisory board of USAID’s political lobby arm to increase USAID funding.

(RELATED: House Oversight Committee Votes To Subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell For Deposition) Ricchetti and Donilon followed former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who sat for several hours of questioning last week. Meanwhile, several close Biden associates — including former White House physician Kevin O’Connor, Jill Biden’s ex-chief of staff Anthony Bernal, and former aide Annie Tomasini — have recently invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee.

By Blizzard Entertainment 21 hr 55 min ago Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on August 5. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on August 12 with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Upgrading and using the Reshii Wraps unlocks unique challenge gateways to powerful bosses and reveals hidden secrets when you revisit your favorite delves across Khaz Algar. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season's Nemesis.

By Blizzard Entertainment 21 hr 56 min ago Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on 6 August. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on 13 August with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve.

Title: A 13% Dividends From AI? Here Are The Tickers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/07/31/a-13-dividends-from-ai-here-are-the-tickers/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. By now you’ve no doubt heard the argument that AI is a bubble, and there’s no way Big Tech will make a significant profit from it, given the massive amounts of cash they’ve already piled in. That take is just plain wrong—truth is, the tech giants are already booking profits from AI. And we closed-end fund (CEF) investors can grab our share at a discount—and at dividend rates running all the way up to 13%, too. This next chart tells us straight-up why the “AI-is-unprofitable” theory is off the mark. Look at the far left of this chart and you see that communication-services stocks led in profit growth in the second quarter of 2025. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are both titans of that sector, and both have invested billions in AI. They’ve largely done it by buying chips and other hardware, as well as software, from IT firms like NVIDIA (NVDA). That pop in communication-services earnings proves that these companies are profiting from AI. Similarly, the second-highest earnings gains in the chart above, in IT, confirms that AI actually does make money for Big Tech. When it comes to high-yielding, tech-focused CEFs, there are basically four tickers that income investors look to. Let’s check in on those now. As you can see in the chart below, all four of these funds’ net asset values have been roaring higher, with the 12.3%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in green, leading by a small amount over the last three months. It’s followed closely by its sister fund, the 7.7%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple. The BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), with its huge 13% yield (in blue), and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK), (in orange and paying 6%) bring up the rear. The interesting thing, however, is the fact that these funds still trade at discounts to net asset value (NAV). The best values are the three BlackRock funds (again in green, blue and purple): We’ve seen BSTZ’s discount remain basically where it was three months ago, despite its strong NAV return in that time, while BST’s discount has widened slightly, despite its strong performance. The third BlackRock tech CEF, the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), has seen its discount narrow slightly (April was a great time to buy BTX). The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is the priciest of our quartet, but context matters here, as its premium to NAV, which it has held for much of the last decade, suddenly disappeared. Let’s stick with STK for a bit. Despite that fund’s smaller discount, is it still worth our time? I’d say yes, given the next chart. But there is a caveat that we’ll get into shortly. Before we get to that, we see that STK, whose NAV (in purple above) has closely matched the NASDAQ 100 (whose benchmark index fund is shown in orange) over the last decade. That makes STK a good way to get tech exposure, plus the index’s diversification. I mention that diversification because STK is tech-heavy, with core names like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA and Apple (AAPL). But like the NASDAQ, it also branches out a bit, with holdings in companies like Visa (V) and Bloom Energy (BE), which focuses on products that help customers generate power on-site. On the dividend side, STK’s 6% yield far outruns the NASDAQ’s 0.5%, and the CEF has also never cut its payouts. However, STK is contending with funds yielding a lot more—up to 13% in the case of the highest-paying BlackRock fund, BTX. That’s the real reason for STK’s growing discount: Even though it was swept up in the tech rally, its lower payouts aren’t enough for many income investors, now that there’s more competition, plus dividends that nearly double STK’s 6% yield, among tech CEFs. This is why the bigger discounts offered by the BlackRock funds are the better deals here, and why STK’s discount isn’t yet big enough to warrant our attention.

Title: Panama says it could take over ports as it threatens to upend $20B deal with BlackRock, MSC
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/business/panama-says-state-could-take-over-ports-as-it-threatens-to-upend-20b-deal-with-blackrock-msc/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T20:47:24Z
Full Content:
Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday the Central American nation could potentially take over two key ports along the canal — a move that would scupper US asset manager BlackRock’s bid to gain control of the vital shipping lane. Mulino asked the nation’s top court to scrap a contract with current operator CK Hutchison, which would then allow Panama to forge its own public-private partnerships for the two ports. CK Hutchison has agreed to a $20 billion deal to hand over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which has given it control over the Balboa and Cristobal ports located at both ends of the canal. It renewed that agreement – planned to last 25 years – in 2021, but has since proposed a sale of the ports to appease President Trump’s demands for the US to “take back” the waterway, citing national security concerns. While Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business MSC is slated to be the lead investor, the two Panama ports included in the deal will go to BlackRock, according to Bloomberg. Panama’s Comptroller General’s office filed two lawsuits this week asking the Supreme Court to declare the sale unconstitutional and to nullify its contract with CK Hutchison, claiming the operator did not follow required steps – like getting it greenlit by the comptroller. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino said at a press conference Thursday. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added on the lawsuits. MSC, CK Hutchison and the White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. It’s not the first time Panama’s comptroller has taken aim at its contract with CK Hutchison, arguing that there were irregularities from the previous government and that the deal has brought insufficient revenue to Panama. The results of a recent audit by the comptroller’s office have not been released.

China has also pushed back hard against the BlackRock deal, fearful of losing critical access to the Panama Canal. Beijing officials have threatened to squash the sale unless Cosco, China’s largest shipping firm, gets a stake equal to those of BlackRock and MSC, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tensions have continued to heat up as China and the US negotiate on a trade deal. Panama’s government said state partnerships could also solve the problem of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

Title: Panama Brings 'Abusive' Ports Contract with China-Linked Company to Supreme Court

Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores filed two separate lawsuits on Wednesday against a contract between the country and Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, over the “abusive” contract that grants PPC control of two ports at the Panama Canal. The lawsuits, filed at Panama’s Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ), demand that the decades-old contract be rendered null and void over the “many irregularities” that his office found in detriment of national interests during a months-long audit of the company and its management of the two ports. “The duty of this Comptroller’s Office is to defend the money of Panamanians and always be on the side of the best national interest,” Flores said during a press conference presenting the lawsuits on Wednesday. “That is why today we are referring directly to the Supreme Court, appealing to them as the Panamanian State and as comptroller in these two lawsuits. We hope they will be admitted promptly and that we will have the results that the country obviously needs and that the citizens are waiting for.” Since 1997, PPC, a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. One of the ports is located at the Pacific entrance to the canal in Balboa and the other on the Atlantic side of the trade route in Cristóbal, in the province of Colón. At the time, the administration of former Panamanian President Ernesto Pérez Balladares granted a 25-year lease to PPC for the management and administration of the two ports. The original 1997 contract reportedly contained automatic lease renewal provisions invoked in 2021 to grant PPC an additional 25-year lease period that will run through 2047. Flores, who took office in 2024, claimed in April that the renewal did not have the endorsement of the Office of the Comptroller General, refuting statements issued by his predecessor Gerardo Solís, who claimed otherwise. The two ports have been at the center of an ongoing debate started by President Donald Trump last year after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal — which the United States originally built and ceded to Panama in 1999. President Trump and several members of his administration have denounced China’s alleged growing influence in the country and control of the interoceanic trade route. International outlets have described PPC’s parent company, HK-based Hutchison Port Holdings, as an “example” of China’s presence in the trade route after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020 that prevented Beijing from imposing communist laws in Hong Kong through a “national security” law intended to suppress democratic protests. The law effectively outlawed anti-communist dissent and imposed Beijing’s law, which gives the Party total control over supposedly “private” businesses. The Office of Panama’s Comptroller General has audited PPC during the past year over its management of the two ports. The audit reportedly revealed evidence of multiple breaches of contract that amounted to more than $300 million in losses to Panamanian state coffers. At the time, Comptroller Flores accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of misrepresenting financial figures related to PPC and its management of the ports. Flores stressed during his press conference that Panama’s relationship with PPC has been “harmful” and his office seeks to correct the “historical damage” caused to the Central American nation. The comptroller general said he hopes that the nation’s Supreme Court promptly admits both lawsuits and that the judicial process yields results that “respond to the public outcry.” “We Panamanians do not agree with or approve of what the country has been through,” Flores reportedly said. Flores denounced this year that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described the situation as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez deemed the PPC contract “unconstitutional,” arguing that its terms stood in violation of fundamental principles of Panama’s constitution. At press time, Hutchison Port Holdings’ parent company CK Hutchison Holding is undergoing negotiations with asset manager Blackrock and other companies over the sale of the two ports as part of a broader sale of 43 ports spread across 23 countries. Panamanian President José Raul Mulino expressed his support for Comptroller General Flores’ legal action in remarks given during a press conference Thursday morning. Mulino denounced the contract, its 2021 renewal, and how much it has “cost” the country. “The Comptroller’s lawsuit, which I fully support, is well justified. We have all seen what that contract has cost the Panamanian nation over time. What we have not gained from it, apart from the fact that we are 10-percent shareholders, is a very, very paltry sum,” Mulino said. “When that contract was renewed for another 25 years, the Comptroller did not endorse it,” he continued, “and that is what is being challenged in court, the nullity of the contract because it was not endorsed as all contracts between the State and any third party must be endorsed.” On the subject of C.K. Hutchinson’s sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, Mulino said that the negotiation “is at a standstill as far as we know.” “Remember that this is a broad process. There are 41 ports around the world that are being sold, and the two ports in Panama are in a separate process. So one thing has nothing to do with the other,” Mulino said. “The Republic of Panama will definitely adopt a port policy which we will announce in due course with the aim of enforcing what I mentioned about the canal,” he continued, “a coherent maritime and logistics strategy for the Panamanian state, in all its services, civil servants, etcetera, so that we can truly take advantage of the privilege of our strategic geographical position.” Christian K.

Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Reuters) – Public-private partnerships could take over two key ports near the Panama Canal if courts invalidate a contract with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison‘s to operate them, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said on Thursday. CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake in the local Panama Ports Company, which had a 25-year concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, located at both ends of the canal, renewed in 2021. The contract has been at the center of a dispute since U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the waterway due to China’s influence over Panama’s maritime industry. CK Hutchison is trying to sell its stake in the Panamanian company as part of a massive global deal. Two suits were filed with the Supreme Court this week by Panama’s Comptroller General’s office, aiming to declare the agreement unconstitutional and to nullify the contract on the basis the renewal did not follow required legal steps, including the Comptroller’s greenlight. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino told a press conference. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added, referring to the lawsuits. The comptroller has openly criticized the contract over alleged irregularities by the previous government and insufficient revenue to Panama from the deal, but the full results of a recent audit by his office have not been revealed. The legal challenges the contract is facing in Panama are adding troubles to a diplomatically sensitive plan from a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock BLK.N to buy a large portion of CK Hutchison’s global ports business, a possible deal that has been celebrated by Washington but criticized in China. The deal has become increasingly politicized amid a U.S.-China trade war. Beijing argues it has significant national interests in the transaction and the proposed deal would be a betrayal of the country. Panama’s government is also seeing partnerships with the state as a solution for the operation of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals FM.TO, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

The Site WordPress.com hasn’t changed up anything dramatically this month. Nothing here to get angry about. They have still broken things however, so there is still some minor disappointment. Back in January I mentioned that WP.com had introduced Activity Pub integration, which let you connect your blog directly with the Fediverse, so that it would appear on, allow people to follow it, and auto update for users of services such as Mastodon. Pretty cool. You could even leave a comment on the blog from Mastodon, which was honestly easier than trying to leave a comment here without logging into a WP.com account. I had a couple of problems with it on this blog, and turned it off in March as it was causing problems with Discord. But I let it run with my other blog, EVE Online Pictures, because its format was quite well suited to the integration. And so it appeared in the Fediverse. EVE Online Pictures – Fediverse Version Granted, nobody actually followed it, which is about par for the course for the 17 years that blog has existed. There is no broad interest in EVE Online screen shots. It would get a like now and then… but even that seemed to dry up in June. And then I discovered that WP.com broke the whole Activity Pub thing, so the likes stopped because the integration stopped working after June 11, 2025. This corresponded with an update to the blog settings for WP.com hosted blogs and there does not seem to be any way to get the integration running again. I cannot even turn it off and back on again, the most basic of trouble shooting, because the on/off option has gone missing. One Year Ago There was the end of the Steam Summer sale, which always prompts me to summarize my gaming so far in the year. There was also Pokemon Go Fest 2024. My wife and I also made it to level 46 in the game. Enad Global 7 bought the struggling title Palia and assigned it to Daybreak. Meanwhile, the EQ and EQII producer’s letters gave hints about their fall plans. Playable Worlds, having announced Stars Reach, put the game up to wishlist on Steam and got on all the usual social media sites. Then there was the start of the pillars posts, followed by more pillars, and then even more pillars. It was like the Acropolis. I played a bit more Tarisland. In EVE Online the Guristas took over the Alliance Tournament XX sponsorship. The AIR daily goals got a change up while CCP made it clear that the “farms and fields” idea for null sec was over. There would, once again, be good space and bad space in null sec. This got Asher to write an open letter to CCP about their plans, which got endorsements even from our traditional foes. I did a Friday bullet points post about CCP announcements around Equinox, Vanguard, Carbon, ATXX timeline updates, and actually getting mentioned in the Community Beats post. Meanwhile I was still on about shuttle destruction in the MER and CCP introduced the weekly 15K skill point injector for Omega accounts. The latter gets you an extra 780K skill points a year if you remember to redeem them. I also sold a SKIN on the Paragon Hub. In game we were out in the Dronelands shooting the new Skyhooks. While out there I narrowly averted disaster when I jumped to the Fraternity staging beacon. Then the invasion of far Catch began in what was the start of the Imperium’s plan to move eastward. PanFam and Fraternity didn’t seem concerned even as we dropped a Keepstar on grid with one of their in U-QVWD. With Cataclysm Classic we bowled over Blackrock Caverns in our second try. Then, because we missed a quest, we went back and did it again as a foursome. Along the way an alt hit level cap. Over in retail, the pre-patch for The War Within landed. There was also the World of Racetrack vision of WoW. In Valheim I made it to the Ashlands, mostly out of my grudge against it. Having gotten there and tested it out I was done. I started back in No Man’s Sky. You start out in trouble and then work up from there. There was the warm up to Blaugust 2024. Finally, WP.com was being awful, because that is what they do best. Five Years Ago The 2020 Steam Summer Sale finished up. I bought some things. In TorilMUD, aging was abolished. And a good thing too! SSG was compensating people for outages in Lord of the Rings Online. Minecraft gave us the Nether Update. I went out and found a crimson forest in the nether. I was reflecting on Diablo II at its twenty year anniversary. We didn’t know for sure there would be a remaster at that point. Blizzard was getting us more details about the Shadowlands beta and launch. In WoW Classic the instance group was finishing up Zul’Farrak and then meandering about Maraudon, which we finished up on our second run. Blizzard was banning botters in classic while getting ready to open up the Ahn’Qiraj war effort event. As part of the anti-botting effort they were limiting the number of instances players could spawn in a day, but we were at least getting some extra bag slots. CCP cancelled their San Diego player event as Covid did not look to be going away any time soon. I also resigned myself to the fact that, despite past promises, CCP was going to keep selling skill points in EVE Online. (I’d feel better if they stopped being so dumb about it.) In game we saw the launch of the Zenith Quadrant, the first part of which was a small update to command ships, and official support for the capsuleer cemetery at Molea. The June MER showed that mining was shifting to high sec after the resource changes. But the bulk of my posts in July were about the opening of World War Bee, which I chose to list out rather than try to create a paragraph narrative: It was kind of a big deal at the time. Ten Years Ago I was feeling a bit of the summertime MMO ennui blues. Windows 10 launched, bringing with it the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. This wasn’t your Win 3.1 Solitaire or Freecell, and more is the pity. Project: Gorgon was off with another Kickstarter campaign. Would the third time be a charm? (Spoiler: yes) Need for Speed: World shut down, so I said farewell to Palmont. Derek Smart began what would become is crusade against Star Citizen, detailing why he felt we would never see the game that was promised. It could have ended there, but RSI responded in a way guaranteed to turn it into a fight and took away his Rear Admiralty. Game on! In Minecraft I was learning about not falling off of things, bringing light to dark places, and accumulating materials. Also, sheep stole my mine cart. I was mucking around in War Thunder for a bit. It is a pain to return to the game because there is always a huge update required. Over at Daybreak, there was a vote up for the EverQuest progression server Ragefire about speeding up the unlock of Ruins of Kunark, as well as talk about raids and such. On the EverQuest II side of the house, there was a beta for its first nostalgia servers. I avoided the beta but was there when the servers went live… for the big surprise, the return of the Isle of Refuge, adding to the nostalgia experience. And while that was going on, it appeared to be the end of Smed at Daybreak. In New Eden my alliance, TNT, handed over its last system in Deklein. We then lived in Tribute. The Aegis expansion hit… but there was a delay between that and other bits of what we now call Fozzie sov to be deployed. But entosis link modules were finally able to take sov as the month rolled along. So we started to learn by doing. There was a plan in the Imperium to bring in care bears to mine and rat in order to raise ADMs so that our now much reduced space holdings would remain secure. At one point Mordus Angels managed to claim some sovereignty in Pure Blind! Can you imagine? Crazy times! Meanwhile, in the cash shop… erm… New Eden store, more skins were being rolled out. Or, rather, the same skin on more ships. The blog banter of the month was on about attributes, and I was bitching about never having enough jump clones. On the Azeroth front, Blizzard said they would be announcing the next World of Warcraft expansion… right after the Q2 quarterly report was released, which raised some suspicions in me. What would the subscription numbers look like if they felt they needed a big announcement to distract from them? And I finally got my copy of Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls from the Kickstarter… only two years late. Fifteen Years Ago The late Paul the octopus created the then largest page view day ever in the history of the blog, later to be surpassed by Cats playing Patty Cake and Alamo. Actually writing about games is never popular. I was told I write like Cory Doctorow… or maybe Ian Flemming. My daughter was Banned from Club Penguin. Tears were shed, lessons were learned. EverQuest II Extended, the free to play EverQuest II, was announced. I wondered whether trying to play it without paying at all would be a challenge in and of itself. Meanwhile, there was some evidence that EQII accounts had value. That stunning news no doubt got them going on the authenticator they announced at Fan Faire this year. I completed 100 levels in The Agency: Covert Ops. I was unemployed, what can I say? StarCraft II launched. I never bought a copy and the base edition eventually went free. It never surpassed the original in popularity and Blizz eventually just stopped doing content for it, though like many old Blizz titles, it does get a patch once in a while to keep it playable. Need for Speed World, an MMO version of the Need for Speed series, launched. I ended up playing it for a bit. But, being an EA MMO, it was doomed to be shut down. In EVE Online Hulkageddon III ended, and it even had a video wrap-up. And then PLEX was made transportable in space. I wonder if they waited for Hulkageddon to be over for that? In another Summer hiatus season, the instance group started another run at LOTRO. This time it was Bung who was out, having the dual issues of moving and having a new baby to care for. Those of us in Middle-earth hung out with old friends. That put off deciding who my main character was, by letting me roll another one! Blizzard gave up on some of their RealID plans thanks to much public kvetching. Shortly there after, the ESRB came out against Real ID as being bad for consumer security while proving they too were bad for consumer security. Blizzard revamped Parental Controls again. As much as I have griped about them, they are better than any comparable controls I have seen, even in games that offer that as a feature. World of Warcraft Magazine issue #2 showed up. Issue #4 would arrive 9 months later, which is kind of a long time for an alleged quarterly publication. Once issue #5 was finally out, the whole thing was shut down. And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons? Twenty Years Ago Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas gets rated adults only (AO 18+) and the company faces sanctions when the hot coffee mod unlocks a hidden mini-game that existed in the product which allow the protagonist to have sex with his girlfriends. Unlike some other infamous graphic mods, this one was not fan created content, but something the company put into the game. In EVE Online the Cold War expansion hit, bringing freighters, dreadnoughts, and player owned outposts (“Permanent” caputurable stations, not to be confused with Player Owned Starbases, the doughty POS that remains to this day) in null sec. Those stations are gone, but remembered via special faction Fortizars. Forty Years Ago The Amiga 1000, the first in the line of Commodore’s Amiga series of computers, is debuted. Launched in an era when DOS users were still working from a command prompt and Mac users could run exactly one program at a time, the Amiga brought performance, multitasking, multimedia, and high resolution graphics to the masses. Later versions of the Amiga, combined with the Video Toaster software package, would do for video production what the Macintosh and the laser printer did for desktop publishing. Forty-Five Years Ago Atari releases Missile Command to arcades, one of the iconic titles of the era. Not the first arcade title to use a trackball, but it certainly helped cement the trackball as an input device. It hasn’t been ported/copied onto as many platforms as Tertis, but it has never gone away either.

I’ll get into that below. Also, WoW Classic is back… a bit. I mean, we had the pre-patch all month. And LOTRO… well… I did get to Mordor. I’ll always have that. Enshrouded The group has made some effort to get together and do a few things, but it is summer and people have things to do on the weekends. We did make some progress, including getting to the spire in the Albaneve Summits. We’re not ready to fight the dragon yet, but we should be able to mount an expedition to get the blast furnace once we’re all around. EVE Online I ended up playing a lot in New Eden, if “playing” is the right word. I didn’t go on a lot of ops… though there were plenty to go on… but I had plenty to do in finishing up the move, starting with filtering down all the stuff in my hangar. I had piled so much in there that I went over the item limit. So there was some inventory management time. Also some ship reassembly, including some Epithals, which are used to haul PI materials, because it was also time to get my PI back online, as the market had started to recover. And then I stuck an alt in an Ishtar and did Forsaken Hubs for a couple of days, just to earn some ISK. That is probably worth a post soon. Pokemon Go My focus for the month was largely around trying to advance some achievements to get to platinum level as that is going to be the biggest barrier. I knocked out a few, but I am still 10 shy and I am close to being done with the easy ones. Meanwhile, my wife is still level 47 because she still needs to walk 25km in a week… something she totally does, but she leaves her phone sitting on the desk or counter while doing so. Like I said, keep your phone in your pocket to get steps! RimWorld With the launch of the Odyssey update I grabbed a copy of that and went and played some RimWorld for a few days. It is still a fine answer to the question, “What do I do with six hours of free time on a Saturday afternoon/evening?” You can sit there for hours fiddling with your colonists and their base. It is also kind of amusing to see the start points for the different DLC paths pop up. But after a few days of dealing with the problems of my colonists, I decided to step back from it again. It is engaging but not entirely satisfying for me now. WoW Classic Oh, and stepping back from RimWorld might have coincided with Mists of Pandaria landing in WoW Classic. I got my Pandarian out of the tutorial and did some pet battles, but with the opening of the expansion I jumped right in… literally… you jump and parachute into the expansion as part of the opening. It has, however, been kind of slow going… though I remember that being the case back in the day as well. The Jade Forest is not the best zone in the expansion. We’ll see if I carry on, or if the group decided to take a panda vacation from Enshrouded for a bit. Coming Up Well, as I have mentioned a few times, it will be Blaugust 2025. Expect some posts to go along with that, starting tomorrow. At the back end of the month will be Gamescom, and Blizz is expected to announce a couple of things… like maybe the timeline for Midnight and when housing might become a thing in WoW. Fantasy Critic League will carry on, though my next title to launch isn’t until September. So I’ll be in last place for a while still. Otherwise, it will be the usual stuff. In EVE Online we might get a hint about the next expansion and we might be about due for another update in Enshrouded… though I suspect that will come closer to November. “And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons?” Worth the price of admission, right there. Thanks for the giggle!! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

In total, Tenev referenced tokenization 11 times, while also mentioning Robinhood’s stock tokens on a handful of occasions. The digital assets, which offer synthetic exposure to private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, were unveiled for European users in June, alongside company ambitions to build its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. During the hour-long broadcast, Tenev invoked tokenization within five minutes, a term used to describe the process of representing real-world assets using tokens on a blockchain. In some ways, the episode mirrored Facebook parent Meta’s pivot away from the metaverse in 2023, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg referenced artificial intelligence 20 times on an earnings broadcast. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” saying investors will benefit from 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and self custody. Robinhood can make “all sorts of assets” accessible for users that weren’t feasible before, he said. Robinhood’s stock price has nearly tripled this year, rising 179% year-to-date to $104 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. Despite a cooldown in crypto trading revenue, the firm posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits in the second quarter. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. Now, with the SEC committed to advancing tokenization frameworks under a crypto-friendly White House, Robinhood is positioning itself as a major player in the space, and one that could potentially benefit from the same regulatory tailwinds as crypto-native firms for years to come. Asked by an analyst for feedback that Robinhood is getting on tokenizing private assets, Tenev said that it’s addressed a mainstream criticism toward digital assets, namely the claim that they’re not tied to anything with "fundamental utility” and are ephemeral like memes. Aside from customers’ apparent demand for stock tokens, Tenev said the product's rollout demonstrated “the power of crypto technology and show[ed] a roadmap to what Robinhood could be if it was rebuilt from the ground up on crypto rails.” But not everyone was satisfied with Robinhood’s stock tokens, including OpenAI, which slammed the product as an unauthorized attempt to tokenize its equity. Not long after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned firms that their tokenized offerings must comply with securities laws, and a blockchain isn’t a valid way of getting around that. Tenev told Decrypt last week that he thinks the regulator’s warning was not specific to Robinhood, and on Wednesday, he noted that “some things need to happen” regulatory-wise to unlock tokenization’s true potential, including a look at investor accreditation laws. At the end of the day, Robinhood said that it’s still in the first phase of its tokenization strategy, which involves creating a sustainable supply of stock tokens. The second phase will involve getting the tokens to trade on Bitstamp, a crypto exchange that Robinhood acquired this year. Phase three, Tenev said, will allow users to plug stock tokens into decentralized finance, or DeFi protocols. DeFi applications allow users to self-custody their assets and transact natively on blockchain networks. “We have the technical capabilities to do all of this,” he said. “It's just a question of going through the regulatory process, and we think that's basically the optimal path.” Robinhood did not immediately respond to Decrypt.

Title: Circle: The Digital Dollar’s Unlikely King

Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:06:57Z

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The Infrastructure Powerhouse Built on Regulation, Compliance, and Transparency. Why the Real Battle Is Just Beginning The numbers told the story before anyone understood it. Circle's IPO wasn't just big; it was a spectacle. Priced at $35, the stock rocketed to nearly $300 within weeks, setting off a Wall Street frenzy. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, is used wherever value moves in crypto. It is embedded across protocols, blockchains, and DeFi platforms, and is becoming the connective layer between crypto and traditional finance. Circle stands as a rare asset in modern markets: a compliant, regulated, revenue-generating gateway to a financial system being rewritten in real time. Beneath the euphoria lies a paradox: Circle earns less from USDC than the partners helping distribute it. In 2024, Coinbase received $908 million, about 54 percent of Circle's total revenue. Circle retained the remaining 46 percent. That imbalance, as one-sided as it now seems, may have been the necessary price of market share. The revenue-sharing agreements weren't a misstep. They were Circle's way in: the cost of catching up, the price of market share. Circle launched USDC in 2018, entering a market where Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, already had a four-year lead and dominated liquidity, adoption, and trading pairs across exchanges. Tether operated under an offshore model and looser compliance standards. Coming from behind, Circle played a different game, turning regulation into a competitive edge and transparency into a trust-building tool for regulators and institutions. The results validated the approach: between 2018 and 2021, USDC's supply surged more than 8,300 percent, nearly doubling Tether's growth over the same period. But there's a deeper risk: its revenue model, anchored in interest income, could unravel if rates come down materially. So why are stablecoins such a big deal? In the first half of 2025 alone, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions. They're used in 89 percent of digital asset trades, power nearly half the liquidity in DeFi protocols managing over $200 billion, and now account for 15 percent of global retail cross-border payments. When someone buys Bitcoin on Coinbase, they're trading stablecoins, not dollars. Stablecoins slash cross-border payment costs by as much as 80 percent compared to traditional bank wires. Across Argentina, Vietnam, Turkey, and Nigeria, millions are turning to USDC for everything from groceries to rent, according to Chainalysis, which ranked these countries among the top five globally for grassroots crypto adoption in 2024. As stablecoins move into the mainstream, Circle's USDC is emerging as the default bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain economy. It's more than digital cash; it's an infrastructure layer for instant, 24/7 financial settlement. USDC spans 23 blockchains, is accepted by 89 percent of major exchanges, and reaches 500 million users across more than 180 countries through wallets and apps. In 2024 alone, its circulation jumped 78 percent to $64 billion, capturing a quarter of the global stablecoin market. Since launch, it has processed over $20 trillion in transactions, bridged $850 billion between crypto and traditional finance, and moved $20 billion through Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol. More importantly, USDC has proven its resilience under extreme stress. It survived the 2021–22 crypto winter when multiple stablecoins collapsed, maintained its peg during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis that threatened its reserve backing, and continued operating seamlessly while competitors faced regulatory scrutiny. Jamie Dimon, Wall Street's most influential banking CEO and longtime crypto skeptic, publicly acknowledged stablecoins in JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call: "We're going to be involved in both JPMorgan Depositcoin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it… The way to be cognizant is to be involved." And no stablecoin is more institutionally aligned than USDC. Circle's compliance-first strategy looks less like a hedge and more like a masterstroke. Circle's business model is deceptively simple. It earns interest on the dollars backing every USDC in circulation. With more than $60 billion worth of tokens issued, Circle holds an equal amount in reserves. About 85 percent of those reserves sit in a BlackRock-managed money market fund earning around 4 percent annually; the rest is held in cash at major banks. That interest income makes up the bulk of Circle's revenue. But the company doesn't get to keep most of it. To grow USDC's footprint, Circle signed revenue-sharing agreements with major crypto exchanges. These deals gave its partners a share of reserve income to promote and integrate USDC. The most favorable terms went to Coinbase: USDC's co-creator and largest distributor. Under the agreement, Coinbase keeps 100 percent of the interest on USDC held on its platform, which typically totals tens of billions of dollars, plus 50 percent of net reserve income from all other USDC in circulation after other partners take their share. The deal auto-renews through 2026 and could extend to 2029 if usage milestones are hit. In 2024, Coinbase earned more from USDC than Circle did. These terms made sense when market penetration was the goal—but now they leave Circle boxed in. Binance and Bybit also negotiated their own revenue-sharing deals, each securing a mid-to-high single-digit percentage of reserve income. While these cuts are smaller than Coinbase's, they still reduce Circle's overall take. In total, Circle retains only about 40 to 50 percent of net reserve income, all while bearing the full operational, compliance, and regulatory burden. And with interest rates expected to decline, the overall revenue pool is likely to shrink, tightening the squeeze just as Circle tries to scale into public markets. Circle isn't standing still. It's building new revenue streams that leverage its infrastructure: transaction fees, blockchain partnerships, and financial products with 100 percent gross margins. Blockchain partnerships monetize USDC's presence across networks. As new blockchains compete for users, hosting USDC brings instant legitimacy. Circle selectively charges integration fees for premium partners, turning network expansion into revenue. One of Circle's most effective pivots is charging fees for moving USDC between different blockchain networks. Think of it like a toll for crossing bridges between digital financial systems. Once offered for free, Circle now charges roughly 0.03 percent per transfer. With $20 billion in flows, it's become one of their fastest-growing income sources. Circle is also expanding into higher-margin financial products. Its acquisition of USYC, a digital money market fund, generates steady fee income from institutional exposure to government securities. Unlike USDC, these products carry no revenue splits. While these new revenue streams are gaining traction, Circle's long-term play is far bolder: embed USDC deep into the foundation of global finance. General payments represent a $240 trillion market where USDC's instant settlement could eliminate days-long delays and costly intermediaries. Circle envisions USDC becoming the digital backbone for everyday commerce, capturing a share of transaction fees from a market far larger than crypto trading. Cross-border payments offer the clearest near-term opportunity. Traditional wire transfers can take days, incur high fees, and pass through multiple correspondent banks. USDC can settle these transfers instantly and reduce costs by up to 80 percent. Circle's Cross-Border Payments Network is in early development, but partnerships with incumbents like FIS suggest a serious push into this space. Most ambitiously, Circle is partnering with ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, to pilot the use of USDC as collateral and settlement infrastructure for traditional financial instruments. If successful, this could dramatically accelerate settlement times, lower capital requirements for traders, and enhance market efficiency, positioning Circle to earn fees on trillions in global equity, bond, and derivatives transactions. These early initiatives show how Circle could turn its compliance-driven infrastructure into a scalable, high-margin business. Then came the regulatory watershed moment. In July 2025, the GENIUS Act swept through Congress, mandating full reserves and strict licensing for all stablecoins. Competitors scrambled to comply. Circle? It was already there—with monthly attestations, money transmitter licenses in 46 U.S. states, and years of regulatory groundwork. Overnight, its compliance burden became everyone else's nightmare—and Circle's competitive moat. Anyone can issue a stablecoin, but building trust, liquidity, and ubiquity takes years. Circle didn't just launch a token; it built the infrastructure everyone else now relies on. PayPal's PYUSD highlights the limits of closed ecosystems. Despite a massive user base, adoption has lagged due to limited utility outside its own platform. In contrast, adoption by Standard Chartered, Stripe, FIS, Visa, Mastercard, and even BlackRock reflects Circle's growing momentum. Near-zero interest rates would devastate Circle's revenue model, cutting reserve income while it surrenders 60 percent to partners. Regulatory winds could shift: a new administration might view private stablecoins as threatening dollar supremacy, or the Fed could launch its own digital currency. Most critically, if traditional finance adoption stalls, Circle's vision of embedding into global finance could remain just that: a vision. Without massive scale in traditional markets, its new revenue streams would stay subscale, leaving Circle dependent on a reserve interest model where it keeps the minority share. Now Circle is chasing the final piece of institutional legitimacy: a U.S. banking license. Its application for an FDIC charter is more than a regulatory formality; it's a strategic move to embed itself within the financial system. If approved, Circle would gain direct access to Fed payment rails, the ability to offer traditional banking services, and the trust halo of being a federally supervised institution. More importantly, it could position USDC as the safest digital dollar in circulation: government-regulated, fully reserved, and interoperable, without being state-controlled. In many ways, Circle functions like the Fed's unpaid R&D lab. Each USDC transaction is a real-time experiment in how programmable dollars might move through a modern financial system. Rather than launch a controversial FedCoin, regulators may opt to shape USDC, controlling the plumbing without owning the faucet. The application process won't be easy. Most crypto banking efforts have struggled to cross the finish line, and approval could take 18 to 24 months. But if Circle succeeds, it won't just sit on top of the financial system; it will become part of it. Circle's punishing revenue splits may reflect the cost of building foundational infrastructure. But if it executes on its trillion-dollar vision, those trade-offs could become footnotes to a much bigger success story. With regulatory tailwinds, monetization levers, and a banking charter in play, Circle is positioning for its next act. As CEO Jeremy Allaire put it, "we're still in the very early, early days of this," with stablecoins poised to scale into the trillions in circulation. The question isn't whether programmable dollars will reshape finance, but whether Circle will control the rails when they do. For investors, it's not just a fintech bet; it's a wager on who defines the future of money.

Title: Ripple CTO Explains Why XRP Ledger Lags Despite 300+ Bank Deals
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-lags-300-bank-deals/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:00:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple chief technology officer David “JoelKatz” Schwartz moved to explain the gap between Ripple’s oft-touted roster of bank relationships and the still-modest on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), responding at length on July 30 to a widely shared thread of questions from investor and YouTuber Andrei Jikh. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz pointed to compliance realities, institutional behavior, and product roadmap items—most notably a forthcoming “permissioned domains” model—as key reasons that institutional flows remain largely off-chain today. Jikh’s prompt captured long-standing critiques: after more than a decade and “300+ bank partnerships,” why isn’t the XRPL clearing “billions in daily on-chain volume,” why would payers choose a volatile asset like XRP over stablecoins, and—in a world saturated with fiat-linked tokens—do bridge assets still matter? He also raised questions about tokenization strategy, including why a firm such as BlackRock would select XRPL rather than operate a captive chain, and about geopolitical risk for non-US users. Schwartz’s central explanation for sluggish on-chain settlement was blunt about the constraints facing regulated entities that cannot unknowingly transact against illicit counterparties on public DEX liquidity: “Even Ripple can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Features like permissioned domains will address this.” The post acknowledged “it has been very slow” to shift institutional flows on chain, even as he argued that institutions are “starting to see the benefits.” Pressed by another user on whether the same counterparty-risk problem exists on other L1s, Schwartz said that, depending on how features are used, “generally decentralized exchanges on public layer 1’s don’t give you any control or knowledge of who your counterparties are.” The point was procedural rather than moral—“regulations aren’t always totally logical,” he added—underscoring why regulated payment flows have struggled to route through open liquidity. Schwartz framed “permissioned domains” as a design intended to keep the ledger’s openness while giving compliance-bound participants a venue with rule-enforced counterparties. In follow-ups, he described a structure in which “retail is welcome in the permissioned parts provided they can prove they’re not sanctioned,” and said the “net effect” should be that liquidity in these domains remains comparable to the open side because of market-making between the two. On the stablecoin question, Schwartz rejected the idea that XRP’s volatility automatically disqualifies it for payments. He argued there are use cases where volatility “isn’t a minus, or is even a plus,” and—separately—contended that a functioning bridge requires inventory: “A bridge currency only works if someone is holding it so that you can get it precisely when you need it.” He added that if users don’t know which asset they will need next, they may rationally hold the “dominant bridge” because it’s cheaper to pivot from a liquid hub asset into whatever comes next. Schwartz also addressed whether bridge assets still matter if stablecoins increasingly cover most trading pairs. He allowed that “if one stablecoin wins,” it could act as the bridge, but said he doesn’t think a single stablecoin can win because each is “only…stable relative to one particular fiat currency” and anchored to jurisdictions. That multi-stablecoin reality, he argued, leaves room for a neutral bridge to connect a “long tail” of tokenized assets. Asked why a heavyweight like BlackRock wouldn’t simply build its own chain for tokenization—especially as some brokerages do—Schwartz downplayed the importance of chain homogeneity in a world of interoperability and portability. He urged skeptics to “ask the same question about Circle—why don’t they launch USDC only on their own blockchain?” implying the obvious answer: ubiquity and liquidity come from meeting users where they are, across many networks. On geopolitics, he drew a line between XRPL, which he described as neutral infrastructure, and Ripple’s enterprise products, which are segmented by jurisdiction. “If you’re asking about XRPL, it’s not really US based,” he wrote, adding that the ledger “has never discriminated against any particular participant,” and conceding that, for Ripple’s own products, licensing realities apply and some corridors—“North Korea or Cuba any time soon”—are out of bounds. Schwartz further argued that XRP’s role within Ripple’s payments stack remains material even if much of it is not visible on public ledgers. “I don’t have the numbers in front of me,” he wrote, “but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.” In a related point on XRPL design, he reminded readers that “XRP has a privileged place on the XRP Ledger.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.13.

Nancy McGillivray and Ivana Kiripati will make their debuts against Scotland for Ireland’s first Rugby World Cup warm-up game in Virgin Media Park on Saturday, August 2nd (KO 2pm).

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald, Shirley Zhao and Filipe Pacheco Jul 30, 2025, (Bloomberg) –Panama’s comptroller general asked its Supreme Court to review the government’s contract extension with CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s local ports unit, potentially throwing a new wrench into the conglomerate’s controversial deal to sell its global terminals business. Panamanian official Anel Flores said he asked the court to find unconstitutional a 2021 extension for Panama Ports Co.’s contract to operate two ports along the Panama Canal and declare it null and void. “The contract was bad, one-sided and abusive, against the interests of the country,” he told a briefing in Panama City, adding that the ports belong to the country and should not be negotiated over by others. Panama Ports and CK Hutchison didn’t respond to requests for comment. The development risks further complicating a transaction that’s become a high-profile tussle between the US and China. CK Hutchison shares fell 2.2% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, dropping the most in over a month. “Panama’s legal challenge to CK Hutchison’s port concession could introduce material uncertainty and elevates the risk of delays, potentially derailing the deal or triggering a renegotiation at a lower valuation,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong said. The Panama terminals are at the center of the geopolitically delicate deal for the 43 ports owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison. A buyer consortium backed by BlackRock Inc. is seeking to acquire the business, with the American asset manager taking control of Panama Ports. “What is Panama’s business is that the ports are ours, they belong to the republic of Panama,” Flores told the briefing. “I don’t think it’s right that, at other latitudes, other people are negotiating the future using property that belongs to Panama.” Read More: How Li Ka-shing Landed in the Middle of US-China Tiff: QuickTake Still, some analysts assessed that Panama’s objection would not be a major roadblock for CK Hutchison’s deal, given that other ports in the country are operated by foreign entities. The development “appears a small-ish road bump to completing the global terminal deal,” said David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors. “There are three remaining Panamanian ports, all operated by foreigners, none of which has raised the ire of the comptroller,” he said, “implying there exist benchmark contracts that can be struck for these two ports.” Flores said in April that an audit by his office found that Panama Ports had failed to get proper approvals for its contract extension. Tax breaks under the contract have also cost the Central American nation $1.3 billion, as a series of tax-exempt shell companies operating on Panama Ports’s grounds helped the firm lower the share of profits it paid the government, he told a press conference at the time. Outside of Panama, CK Hutchison and the buyer consortium have been trying to find a solution for the transaction to move forward. While the deal has been hailed by US President Donald Trump as returning the canal to American influence, it’s been furiously opposed by Beijing, which considers BlackRock a proxy for American influence. China has also separately cautioned that antitrust reviews shouldn’t be bypassed, so as to prevent an agreement from being rushed into. “The complexity shows exactly how ports have become assets with larger geopolitical risks and why CK Hutchison wants to reduce its related business,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison said this week that it may invite an unnamed “major strategic investor” from China to join the consortium, a move that’s aimed at appeasing China. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. has been negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the group, Bloomberg News reported. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.
