BlackRock shares declined following a slight revenue miss in the second quarter. Despite this, the company reported strong earnings and a record $12.53 trillion in assets under management. The drop was triggered by concerns over soft margins and market uncertainty. The iShares platform drove significant inflows. Analysts maintain a positive outlook on BlackRock's stock, despite short-term challenges.

Title: How Texas Bullied Big Banks Into Dropping Their Climate Commitments

By Lauren Windsor Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America’s biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event. Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor’s mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank’s execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance. When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank’s executives they were this close “to being sued right now.” After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. Paxton’s office did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment. In a statement, Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street’s financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton’s office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Consumers’ Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives’ “war on woke.” Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn’t stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action. Related Content Jordan Klepper Charts Trump’s Long History With Jeffrey Epstein on ‘The Daily Show’ Why the Trump Administration Is About to Set Fire to 500 Tons of Emergency Food Speaker Mike Johnson Splits From Trump, Calls for Release of Epstein Files What Trump Has Said About Jeffrey Epstein Over the Years Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.” As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. Texas, for instance, passed the nation’s first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters. “At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers’ Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas’ antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We’re not recording this, right? … Please don’t quote me, because I’m telling the inside story on this.” He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits. “They’re all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.” Leo’s network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement’s culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo’s dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives. According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo’s Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers’ Research. CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo’s network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo’s organizations have long operated. Consumers’ Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo’s agenda. Since 2020, Consumers’ Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street. Some of the anti-ESG coalition’s biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers’ Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC’s largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers’ Research’s director, said that Consumers’ Research was the largest donor to SFOF. For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer. ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency. Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests. At one point at the Consumers’ Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.” Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems’ finances. “The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I’m sure, I’m glad I’m not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said. He argued that’s why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

Title: Woman (80) awarded €60,000 after social life impacted by trip on footpath
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/15/woman-80-awarded-60000-after-social-life-impacted-by-trip-on-footpath/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T16:08:13Z

An 80-year-old woman has been awarded just short of €60,000 damages by a judge who said her social life had been greatly impacted by injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell on a hazardous footpath. Judge Terence O’Sullivan said Anita Bryan, a keen golfer, of Somerton, Rochestown Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, had suffered bad injuries to her left wrist and right knee, causing her to abandon golf at her club, Woodenbridge in Arklow, Co Wicklow. “I haven’t played golf for five years because I am unable to walk for the four hours plus that it would take to complete a round,” Ms Bryan told the Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday. Barrister Damian Sheridan, who appeared with Murphy McElligott Solicitors for Ms Bryan, told the court she had tripped on the raised edge of a pavement slab outside Cavistons Food Emporium on the Glasthule Road, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on the day before Christmas Eve, 2019. Ms Bryan said she had been walking arm-in-arm with her husband when her shoe caught on the slab, catapulting her forward. She had fallen and broken her left wrist and suffered a displaced fracture of the right patella of her right knee. “The pain was dreadful and my wrist and leg were put in casts at the hospital. I was in a wheelchair for six weeks,” she told the judge. Ms Bryan said she had received eight cortisone injections and was awaiting more for her knee injury. “I cannot kneel properly any more and one of my favourite hobbies, apart from golf, was gardening,” she said. She sued Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Cavistons Food Emporium, which the local authority let out of the proceeding without blame. The judge told barrister Kevin Callan, counsel for Northstone Construction, Blackrock, Co Dublin, that his client was not liable for the incident. Forensic engineer Alan Conlan said he had examined the footpath shortly after the incident and found one of the slabs loose and rocking. The edge of the slab was raised above the level of other pavement slabs that had later been repaired. “The loose slab was a potential trip hazard,” he said. Awarding Ms Bryan €59,250, barely short of the €60,000 maximum jurisdiction of the court, against the local authority, Judge O’Sullivan said she had suffered bad injuries and had not overstated her claim in any way. “I feel that on the balance of probability that works to the footpath had to have been carried out by the local authority and nobody else,” the judge said. “Ms Bryan was a truthful witness and her life has been severely impacted by the accident. There is no question of contributory negligence.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum Shines Bright As Bank Of America Begins Digital Asset Tracking

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum’s role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. Based on reports, this week’s Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar’s global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,’ designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” First call: Bullish ETH pic.twitter.com/sERRZiTgMq — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 14, 2025 Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn’t just for the token itself. It’s a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum’s code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale. It isn’t all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum’s lead. Still, the network’s mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: WATCH LIVE: Trump plugs energy agenda at Pennsylvania innovation summit

Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Leave your feedback PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump touted tens of billions of dollars of recent energy and technology investments Tuesday in Pennsylvania while boasting of a “true golden age for America” in energy policy and artificial intelligence. Trump traveled to Pittsburgh at a summit helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick that included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit. Watch Trump’s remarks live in our video player above. “I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.” Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence, with Trump saying, “We are way ahead of China, I have to say.” “China and other countries are racing to catch up to America on AI, and we’re not going to let them do it,” Trump said during the hourlong roundtable held in a university gymnasium, speaking often from prepared notes. Flanked by several of his Cabinet members, company executives and local political leaders, Trump added that the U.S. will be “fighting them in a very friendly fashion.” WATCH: Trump rolled back energy tax credits for homeowners and developers. Here’s what that means for you Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.

Here are some ways to lower your electric bill Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant, and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in south-central Pennsylvania. Blackstone plans to spend $25 billion on data centers and building new natural gas-fired power plants in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the company will start construction by the end of 2028, said Jon Gray, its CEO. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. “What’s exciting about this event is it’s a great catalyst for investments and closing deals in the region,” said Jake Loosararian, the founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called AI Avenue that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars, and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. READ MORE: Nippon Steel finalizes $15 billion buyout of U.S. Steel after sealing national security agreement Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus.

Title: 5 stats that show where BlackRock is — and where the world's largest asset manager is going
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-earnings-call-key-stats-showing-trajectory-larry-fink-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:58:57Z
Full Content:
There are lots of big numbers that come up on BlackRock earnings calls. It's what happens when you're the largest asset manager in the world. The key thing for investors in the firm and competitors tracking the behemoth from afar is deciphering which of the gaudy current-day figures will keep growing and which of the optimistic projections will actually happen. BlackRock already manages $12.5 trillion in assets across institutions, insurers, pensions, and wealthy people, mostly in public markets. It's spent the last year and a half acquiring businesses that would help it move more of that money into lucrative private markets, where fees are higher and capital is stickier. At its investor day last month, the firm laid out its goal to hit $35 billion in annual revenue in 2030, an increase from $20 billion in 2024. Business Insider highlighted five stats from the firm's Tuesday call with analysts to demonstrate asset manager is currently and where it hopes to be in five years. The net inflows into BlackRock products in the first half. The influx of assets was led by a record six months from the firm's iShares ETF line, which brought in a net $192 billion of new money. BlackRock's existing business, particularly its low-fee index investing funds, is the biggest pile of money in the industry and is still growing consistently. Still, the first half of the year was not perfect, as some of the firm's actively traded products experienced a performance dip. The decline in performance fees collected by BlackRock in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Rocky equity and bond markets worldwide, caused primarily by the trade policies proposed by President Donald Trump, have been challenging for investors of all sizes to deal with. At BlackRock, the firm's profit margin dipped to 43.3% this quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's second quarter, and CFO Martin Small attributed 75% of that drop to the decline in performance fees. Active equity funds in particular have had a rough 12-month stretch, the firm's earnings supplement shows: Only 40% of assets are above the index or peer median. The firm also noted that private market funds brought in fewer performance fees than last year, but the firm's ambitions for that space remain as large as ever. The amount of revenue HPS Investment Partners is expected to add to BlackRock's coffers in the third quarter, according to Small. The deal for the $165 billion private credit shop closed at the start of July, and Small said the firm will issue the equivalent of up to 13.8 million shares of BlackRock common stock to retain the team at the firm. The retention of HPS's team will be critical for BlackRock, which wants to fundraise significantly for its private-credit and infrastructure offerings over the next five years. The fundraising goal for private market fundraising through 2030. Small said he expects it to ramp up in 2028 as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners, the firm's other large private market investor acquisition, become more ingrained in the firm. CEO Larry Fink said that he was in Asia last week, where demand for infrastructure and other private-public partnerships is already "beyond our imagination." Those partnerships — the firm has pulled in Singapore's Temasek in its artificial intelligence infrastructure push — will be needed if the manager hopes to hit its revenue goals. The proportion of the firm's revenue that it wants to derive from its private markets funds and tech services platform, led by Aladdin, by 2030. The New York-based firm made nearly $10.7 billion in revenue in 2025's first half, driven by its equity ETFs, which hauled in $2.8 billion in revenue alone. Tech services, meanwhile, made roughly a third of that in the same time frame. BlackRock's Aladdin platform already serves more than 200 institutional clients, effectively making the firm an infrastructure provider to many of its clients and some of its competitors. But the firm's fundraising push for its private market offerings also includes the hope that individual retirement accounts in the US will soon be open to such options. Fink and Small both said that litigation reform is needed before that could happen, but are optimistic about what they've heard out of Washington on the subject. "We think we have all the building blocks here," Small said. Correction July 15, 2025: An earlier version of this story misstated BlackRock's revenue target for its private markets and technology businesses by 2030. The goal is for these segments to account for 30% of the firm's revenue, not 40%. Jump to

Title: Solana RWAs surge 217% hitting $553 million in real world assets as memecoins lose focus
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/solana-rwas-surge-217-to-hit-553-million-in-real-world-assets-as-memecoins-lose-focus/

Solana's RWA ecosystem grows over 600% in user adoption, solidifying its position as a high-performance blockchain challenger. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA) market surpassed $550 million and rocketed up 217% year-to-date in 2025. The explosive growth, more than double the pace of the broader market, positions the high-speed blockchain as a serious challenger to Ethereum’s long-held dominance in one of crypto’s most promising sectors. As of press time, Solana has reached $558 million to take third place behind ZKsync Era and Ethereum per rwa.xyz. The numbers behind Solana’s recent ascent in the RWA space are impressive. While the overall market for tokenized assets grew by a respectable 61% this year, Solana’s ecosystem expanded at more than three times that rate. This momentum is fueled by both institutional-grade protocols and a groundswell of retail interest. Key protocols like Ondo Finance and ONe’s institutional fund are leading the charge, collectively accounting for approximately $276 million, or around half of Solana’s non-stablecoin RWA value. However, the most dramatic growth metric comes from user adoption. In a recent 30-day period, the number of unique wallets holding tokenized stocks on Solana surged by an astonishing 684%, jumping from just 7,400 to over 58,000. This rapid adoption is a direct result of Solana’s core architecture. The network’s reputation for high throughput and near-zero transaction costs, famously battle-tested during the memecoin frenzies of late 2024, has created a hyper-efficient environment. What was once seen as a “degen” playground has proven its capacity to handle massive transaction volumes, over 200 million daily at its peak, with over 16 months of uninterrupted uptime. This proven performance is now attracting serious RWA projects that require speed and low fees to manage the complex lifecycle of a tokenized asset. To understand the significance of Solana’s rise, it must be viewed against the industry’s giants. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of RWAs, commanding a 58.4% market share with a colossal $7.7 billion in tokenized value. ZKsync Era is next in line with $2.2 billion and a 17% market share. Yet, a clear divergence in momentum is emerging. In the last 30 days, Ethereum’s and second-place ZKsync Era’s RWA value grew by a sluggish 3.6% and 0.9%, respectively, while Solana’s jumped by 22.3% to reach 4.2% market share and overtake Aptos. The ultimate institutional litmus test is BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the largest tokenized Treasury fund with approximately $2.8 billion in assets under management. While the vast majority of BUIDL resides on Ethereum, BlackRock’s strategic decision to expand the fund onto Solana is a powerful vote of confidence. This move, which has already brought over $25.2 million of BUIDL to the network, validates Solana’s infrastructure. It also signals a sophisticated multi-chain strategy from major institutions, which are beginning to use high-performance chains like Solana as efficient “distribution outposts” for trading and utilizing assets that are custodied on Ethereum. Beyond the headline applications, Solana’s long-term RWA strategy is being solidified by crucial, foundational infrastructure development, the “picks and shovels” needed to build a trillion-dollar market. A landmark integration with enterprise blockchain R3 Corda is a key example. According to Messari, this partnership allows institutions using R3’s trusted, private ledger to tap into the Solana public blockchain for final settlement. It’s a “best of both worlds” approach that bridges private enterprise assets with the liquidity and efficiency of a public chain, positioning Solana as a potential universal settlement layer. Furthermore, a new partnership between the public company DeFi Dev Corp. and oracle provider Switchboard aims to build RWA-specific oracles on Solana. As Messari Research Analyst Matthew Nay notes, “Solana’s appeal stems from its high throughput, near-zero transaction costs, and robust developer ecosystem.” However, for institutions to trust on-chain assets, they need reliable, verifiable data feeds that connect to off-chain value. This focus on building a robust data infrastructure is a critical step toward winning institutional trust and unlocking the next wave of tokenization. The institutional RWA narrative and Solana’s retail-tested performance have created a potent combination. Solana is rapidly transitioning from a network known for its speculative hype cycles into a serious contender for the future of finance. While significant hurdles remain, including historical concerns about network stability and the unresolved legal challenges facing the entire RWA sector, the momentum is undeniable. With its technical advantages, explosive growth, and a growing seal of approval from a giant like BlackRock, Solana has become a key protagonist in the story of how trillions in traditional assets will ultimately move on-chain.

July 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited and its CEO and CIO, Bob Elliott, today rolled out two new actively managed ETFs: the Unlimited HFMF Managed Futures ETF (HFMF) and the Unlimited HFEQ Equity Long/Short ETF (HFEQ), offering investors exposure to managed futures and equity long/short hedge fund strategies, respectively. These latest additions to the Unlimited lineup align with Unlimited’s mission to provide investors with access to transparent, liquid, and cost-effective hedge fund-style returns. These new strategies will allocate across a diversified basket of ETFs and exchange-listed futures contracts, adjusting dynamically based on evolving market conditions. Today’s launch expands Unlimited’s ETF roster to cover the primary hedge fund strategy sectors. “With the addition of our Managed Futures and Equity Long/Short strategies, Unlimited now offers complementary strategies to help achieve diversification in a wide range of investor portfolios,” said Mr. Elliott. “Deploying these strategies in the ETF wrapper, which offers intraday liquidity, affords the manager flexibility to adjust through volatile markets.” Each of Unlimited’s sector ETFs were designed to offer a volatility target aligned with equity markets as an investor-friendly way to add the diversification features of alternatives to a balanced portfolio: Over time, high fees and inefficient tax structures in hedge funds erode returns, and top tier private funds are often inaccessible to the majority of investors. Unlimited developed proprietary machine learning technology to analyze near real-time hedge fund investment returns and efficiently replicate the underlying exposures while maintaining an expense ratio significantly lower than the standard “2 & 20” hedge fund fee model. Unlimited’s ETFs are managed by Mr. Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates, and Bruce McNevin, co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at Unlimited. Mr. McNevin brings extensive experience in quantitative modeling and data science. For more information on Unlimited HFMF, HFEQ, HFGM and HFND please visit https://www.unlimitedetfs.com/. About UnlimitedFounded in 2022 by Bob Elliott, Bruce McNevin and Matt Salzberg, Unlimited is an investment firm using proprietary technology to create strategies that offer lower-cost access to 2 & 20-style alternative investment strategies, such as hedge funds, to a wide range of investors. Mr. Elliott has built innovative hedge fund strategies for more than two decades, including at Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. Mr. McNevin is a Professor of Economics at New York University and has held various data science positions at hedge funds Clinton Group and Midway Group, along with positions at Bank of America and BlackRock.

Media Contacts: Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by visiting www.unlimitedetfs.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Important RisksUnderlying ETFs Risks. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in Underlying ETFs. There is also the risk that the Fund may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of securities held by the Underlying ETFs. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. Machine Learning, Model and Data Risk. The Fund relies heavily on proprietary “machine learning” selection processes. In addition, the composition of the Fund’s portfolio is heavily dependent on proprietary quantitative models as well as information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”). Volatility Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a higher level of volatility than its target hedge fund industry sector, which may result in substantial price fluctuations over short periods. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise or fall significantly, and investors should be prepared for increased levels of volatility compared to traditionalequity funds. Commodity Risk. Underlying ETFs that invest in the commodities markets may subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s or an Underlying ETF’s derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets or index; the loss of principal, including the potential loss of amounts greater than the initial amount invested in the derivative instrument; the possible default of the other party to the transaction; and illiquidity of the derivative investments. Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in securities issued by companies domiciled or headquartered in emerging market nations. Investments in securities traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, currency, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and investments in more developed international markets. Fixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in fixed income securities. The prices of fixed income securities may be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing fixed income securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration and/or higher quality fixed income securities. Foreign Securities Risk. Foreign securities held by Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Futures Contracts Risk. The Fund or Underlying ETFs may invest in futures contracts.Risks of futures contracts include: (i) an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying asset; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market; (iii) the inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iv) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which may be unlimited; (v) an obligation for the Fund or an Underlying ETF, as applicable, to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin, particularly at times when the Fund or Underlying ETF may have insufficient cash; and (vi) unfavorable execution prices from rapid selling. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Short Selling Risk. The Fund may make short sales of securities of Underlying ETFs, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the price of the security will decline. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to buy (“cover”) the security sold short when the security has appreciated in value or is unavailable, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. Short sales also involve the risk that losses may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited. Swap Agreement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying ETF may invest in swap agreements. Swap agreements could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. Swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses. They are also subject to counterparty risk. If the counterparty fails to meet its obligations, the Fund (or the Underlying Fund) may lose money. Definitions:2 & 20 strategy: Describes the standard fee structure charged by advisers of private funds, which generally includes a 2% asset-based management fee, in addition to a 20% performance fee charged on the profits on investments.

Title: Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick team up to promote energy investments in Pennsylvania
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/15/trump-energy-investments-pennsylvania-visit/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T12:02:04Z

By SEUNG MIN KIM and MARC LEVY, Associated Press PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania touted tens of billions of dollars of energy and technology investments Tuesday as the president traveled to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. At the summit, Trump Cabinet officials spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the artificial intelligence race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during a panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects, while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. Blackstone said it will spend $25 billion on data centers and power infrastructure in northeastern Pennsylvania, Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in southcentral Pennsylvania. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. Administration officials speaking at the summit included White House crypto czar David Sacks, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Lutnick. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pa.

Title: BlackRock's assets hit record $12.53 trillion: What's fuelling the surge?

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced a significant surge in its assets under management (AUM), reaching a new high of $12.53 trillion in the second quarter of 2025. This AUM growth, up from $10.65 trillion last year, is primarily driven by a global market rally, fuelled by the prospect of trade deals and interest-rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, brushing aside earlier tariff-related jitters. The shares of the company rose 1.1 per cent in premarket trading after the announcement, reported Bloomberg. The second quarter witnessed a sharp reversal from early April’s market turbulence, led by the US trade and geopolitical policy concerns that battered confidence and fuelled recession fears. A strong labour market, healthy consumer spending and hopes for an easing of trade tensions by President Donald Trump pushed major US indices to all-time highs through the end of June. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 10.57 per cent during this period after escaping bear market territory. BlackRock's assets under management rose to $12.53 trillion in the quarter ended June 30, from $10.65 trillion last year. Despite the overall AUM growth, the company’s long-term net inflows fell to $46 billion in the quarter, down by 9.8 per cent. As equities rallied, fixed-income products saw outflows of $4.66 billion, BlackRock told Bloomberg. The company’s total revenue, most of which is earned as a percentage of assets under management, rose to $5.42 billion from $4.81 billion a year ago. The quarter also saw an increased scrutiny of US treasuries. The benchmark 10-year yield recorded one of its biggest weekly increases since 2001 following the "Liberation Day" shock. BlackRock's fixed-income executives expressed concerns about the potential impact of ballooning US debt on appetite for longer-dated treasuries and the dollar, which recorded its worst first-half performance this year since 1973. However, a weaker dollar tends to boost returns from foreign-currency assets, contributing a positive foreign exchange impact of $171.52 billion in the quarter, compared with a $35.45 billion downward revision in the prior year. The "Big Beautiful Bill" recently passed by the Trump administration is projected to add over $3 trillion to the country's $36.2 trillion debt, putting more pressure on treasuries and the dollar. The low-cost investments leader is actively pivoting towards private markets and tech-enabled portfolio solutions to offset slowing growth in exchange-traded funds caused by intense competition and fee compression as the market matures. Private markets saw inflows of $6.82 billion in the quarter. The New York-based firm aims for its private markets and technology businesses to account for 30 per cent or more of its total revenue by 2030, up from 15 per cent in 2024. As part of this push, BlackRock last month announced plans to include private assets in its retirement plans, a segment that manages over half of the company’s total money. This move mirrors similar initiatives taken by its peer, State Street, which also launched a similar offering along with alternative asset manager Apollo in April, the news agency reported. Technology services revenue rose 26.3 per cent to $499 million, reflecting the first full quarter of data provider Preqin, which BlackRock bought in a $3.2 billion deal last year. The deal closed on March 3, 2025. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint. Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates.

Title: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warns of ‘significant risks’ to US economy over Trump trade policies
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/15/business/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-warns-of-significant-risks-to-us-economy-over-trump-trade-policies/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T11:40:31Z
Full Content:
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon hit back at allies of President Trump on Tuesday, warning that the independence of the Federal Reserve is “absolutely critical” amid a move by GOP bigwigs to force under-fire Chair Jerome Powell to resign. The 72-year-old has been under pressure since The Post revealed that Fed bureaucrats were pushing ahead with a $2.5 billion revamp of its DC headquarters despiting the central bank’s mounting losses. “The President said he’s not going to try to remove Jay Powell,” Dimon said after the publication of the bank’s second quarterly earnings report. “The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical, and not just for the current Fed chairman, who I respect, but for the next Fed chairman.”“Playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences, absolutely opposite of what you might be hoping for,” he said. President Trump — who has repeatedly labeled Powell as “Too Slow” for failing to cut interest rates — on Thursday appointed three new members to the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates federal development projects. The shake up at NCPC, which has five voting members, is being seen as yet another move to pile more pressure on the man he nominated as Fed chair in 2018 to step aside. The Fed chair was accused of lying to Congress by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac boss Bill Pulte, who urged Powell to quit over the scandal. Dimon also used JPMorgan’s earnings call to warn that President Trump’s trade policies pose “significant risks” to the US economy — even as the bank announced second quarter profits that were once again boosted by its trading. The Wall Street veteran, at the helm of JPMorgan for nearly two decades, reiterated that the commander-in-chief’s tariff plans could upend growth, while praising the passing of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. “The US economy remained resilient in the quarter. The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook,” Dimon said, also pointing to an uptick in the company’s investment banking profits. “However, significant risks persist – including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices,” he added. America’s biggest lender said its net income fell to $15 billion, down 17% from the same period last year. This was due to a one-off $8 billion gain in 2024 from its stake in credit card provider Visa, the bank said. JPMorgan’s second quarter profits are equal $5.24 a share, compared to the $4.48 a share forecast by analysts at the London Stock Exchange Group. Trading revenue was up by 8% to $8.9 billion, with both equities and fixed income markets businesses seeing jumps. The firm’s investment banking unit was also up 8% to $2.5 billion in the first signs that dealmaking doom and gloom is starting to lift on Wall Street. Chief financial officer Jeremy Barnaum said the bank’s deals pipeline was “robust” and that M&A sentiment was “noticeably more upbeat.” Both divisions performed better than management’s earlier guidance. In May, JPMorgan a mid-teens percentage drop in investment banking fees, while trading revenue was expected to grow by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage. Dimon’s remarks came as a string of rival Wall Street firms unveiled their financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Investors will be scrutinizing how executives see the impact of tariffs and the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month. Citigroup, led by CEO Jane Fraser, reported its second quarter results on Tuesday before the opening bell, reporting net income of $4 billion, up 25% from a year ago. The bank’s net income of $4.02 billion climbed 25% from the same quarter last year, or $1.96 per share. That is significantly higher than estimates by the London Stock Exchange Group of $1.60. The lender said total markets revenue rose by 16% versus the same period a year ago, while equity revenue alone was up 6% year over year. Banking was another bright spot, with revenue up 18% over the second quarter of 2024, even with losses on loan hedges. Charlie-Scharf-led Wells Fargo, which saw a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap lifted last month, cut its full-year guidance for net interest income. The San Francisco-based lender posted $11.7 billion in net interest income — income from lending minus the cost of deposits — for the three months through June. It fell just short of analysts’ estimates of $11.8 billion. That prompted Wells Fargo to lower its full-year NII growth target to little changed from last year Advertisement

Title: Sen. David McCormick on the battle for AI innovation: ‘Pennsylvania is at the center of it’

Full Content:
President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania will jointly announce roughly $70 billion of energy investments in the state Tuesday as the president travels to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, and it comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster. Neither the White House nor McCormick’s office gave breakdowns of the $70 billion or what the investments entail. McCormick, a Republican first-term senator who is organizing the inaugural event, says the summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania. “Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.” The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend. Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “AI Avenue” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant. In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money. He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Sources familiar with the plan also told Bloomberg that the funding would include federal-private partnerships and possible Department of Energy-led permitting reforms. While exact allocations remain undisclosed as of the time of writing, the package is expected to prioritize regions facing power congestion due to rising AI workloads, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Georgia. According to Axios, over 60 energy and technology CEOs will attend the summit, including representatives from ExxonMobil, Amazon Web Services, Chevron, Palantir, and BlackRock. The initiative comes against a backdrop of mounting strain on U.S. electricity infrastructure, with data centers now among the fastest-growing sources of demand. A Reuters analysis published last week found that demand from AI-driven compute loads is outpacing available generation in key markets. Meta, for example, recently secured 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois under a 20-year agreement. Analysts say Trump’s proposal could redirect investment back toward fossil generation and nuclear while reducing federal support for wind and solar. Bloomberg noted the plan may scale back Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, potentially cutting over 300 gigawatts of future renewable capacity. Critics argue the energy shift could benefit legacy infrastructure at the expense of decarbonization targets. Trump’s announcement also includes a plan to redevelop a former Aliquippa steel mill into a high-density data center complex, according to CBS News. The site would anchor one of several new AI-energy corridors envisioned under the program.

Title: BSGM Partners with CXG to Acquire FINRA/SEC-Registered Broker-Dealer for Real-World Asset Tokenization Expansion

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. BioSig Technologies, an innovative medical device technology company, has announced a collaboration with Compliance Exchange Group (CXG) to lead and manage the acquisition of a specific FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer with licensed operations. The move marks a major milestone in the company’s efforts to become one of the first fully regulated Real-World Asset (“RWA”) tokenization companies trading on a major United States exchange, positioning it as the first NASDAQ-listed SEC and FINRA Compliant Issuer of RWA Tokens in the U.S. When the company completes the acquisition of the broker-dealer, it will create an entity with a significant first-mover advantage in the U.S.-major-exchange-traded RWA-backed tokenized investment opportunities for both major institutional and retail investors in the U.S. With this capability, the platform will be able to significantly accelerate adoption and network effect growth of Streamex’s proprietary on-chain RWA commodity market platform. Moreover, the company will be able to continue to seek out other broker-dealer opportunities in other strategically advantageous countries. Following the acquisition, the FINRA and SEC-registered broker-dealer, with a presence in the U.S., will provide Streamex with the regulatory framework to issue and trade tokenized assets under federal securities laws. BSGM has embarked on the move as its near-term vision is to provide access to fully compliant, gold-backed tokenized assets for U.S. institutional and retail investors targeting the $22 trillion global gold market within the $142 trillion commodities sector, while engaging network-effect-based accelerating growth for the Streamex proprietary on-chain RWA-backed commodity exchange and financing ecosystem. The acquisition will offer Streamex the opportunity to feature among the first Nasdaq-listed companies to issue regulated, gold-backed RWA tokens. Notably, it is in full compliance with both FINRA and SEC regulations, aligning with emerging U.S. digital asset frameworks. Furthermore, Streamex’s Solana-based blockchain enables fast, low-cost issuance and trading of gold-backed tokens, making gold investment accessible to all, with additional commodities markets to come. Also, Streamex aims to hold significant quantities in vaulted gold by 2026, denominating its balance sheet in physical gold to support a recurring revenue model. Following the acquisition, Streamex positions itself as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain, offering a seamless way to invest in physical gold through digital tokens. The platform will allow investors to buy fractional shares of gold with the ease of cryptocurrency, while businesses gain new ways to raise capital. This move aligns with global trends, as institutions like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs tokenize billions in assets, and U.S. regulators begin to clarify digital asset rules. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and Co-Founder of Streamex, commented on the mov,e saying; “The acquisition will be a defining moment for Streamex and BioSig…Acquiring a regulated broker-dealer will help us build the infrastructure to lead the gold tokenization market in the U.S. Our Nasdaq listing and gold-backed platform will unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and reshape the $22 trillion gold market.” ”Morgan Lekstrom, Executive Chairman of the Company, also added; “Tokenizing gold is the future of commodity finance. Streamex’s regulated approach and public market presence make it a pioneer in this transformative space, with the potential to redefine how investors access real assets.”

A renewed move into hard assets echoes past episodes where cracks in sovereign debt markets triggered defensive positioning. Japan’s bond rout may be an early warning of broader fiscal strain. Unrealized losses on Japanese bonds are mounting, with 30-year yields rising to 3.2% on July 15 in levels not seen before, erasing an estimated 45% of their value since 2019, The Kobeissi Letter wrote in an X post on Monday. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio has climbed to 235% leaving the Bank of Japan nursing $198 billion in unrealized losses. That erosion of trust in “risk-free” assets is not localized to Japan, but can be seen across other major developed economies. The U.S. 10-year yield has climbed roughly 40 to 60 basis points this year, echoing upward pressure seen in Japan’s bond market. Since the 2020 lows, yields have risen more than fourfold, driven in part by sustained deficit spending and heavy Treasury issuance. “The reality is that global government bond market liquidity is at a record low, now below 2008 levels,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote. “This is exactly why Bitcoin and Gold are surging to record highs.” The flight to hard assets is palpable, former BlackRock executive and XBTO CIO Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, told Decrypt. “Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a macrohedge and structurally scarce asset,” he said. “The next leg up depends on institutional interest deepening as legislative, fiscal, and monetary tailwinds converge." Meanwhile, spot ETF inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum have soared past $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. That comes amid a backdrop of high interest rates, combined with “just-in-case” financing ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Even with a bleak bond market, some say the U.S. economy now resides in a “goldilocks-like equilibrium," further fueling Bitcoin’s rally. A closer examination of the spot order book shows buyers positioning at 2%, 5%, and 10% below market, suggesting dip-buying interest remains intact despite fading momentum. That reflects a shift in investor sentiment, which was previously skewed towards asks in Bitcoin perpetuals a few days earlier. Historical data shows that Bitcoin reacted positively the last time such signals occurred. Bitcoin is down more than 5% from its July 14 record of $123,300, with over $300 million in long positions liquidated over the past 12 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

This has disrupted the global markets and have spread a wave of uncertainties whose chain-effects are clearly visible on the domestic market as well. Moreover, the prolonged geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine continue to act as a deterrent to the demand, thereby adding further woes to the already ailing sector. Going forward, we expect trade activities to be discreet till Trump tariffs are completely rolled out, as this will decide how the industry will navigate with the new tariff regime. Additionally, we will need to monitor the development regarding the India-US Bilateral Trade Talks closely as that would decide the further course of trade activities between both the countries.

Pricol shares flat on the NSE at ₹447 “The continued moderation in India’s CPI inflation to 2.10% in June 2025—the lowest since January 2019—marks a pivotal moment for the economy. With food inflation turning negative (-1.06%) due to broad-based deflation in key staples like vegetables, pulses, and cereals, consumer purchasing power may receive a short-term boost. This benign inflation print could give the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) greater headroom to consider easing. However, with core inflation components such as health and education still elevated above 4%, any monetary accommodation must be carefully sequenced to avoid reigniting price pressures in non-food sectors. The RBI is unlikely to act on the basis of a single data point. But if headline inflation remains below 4%, soft private consumption persists, and there is greater clarity on global developments, a rate cut cannot be ruled out. The tone of upcoming monetary policy statements will be critical to watch.

Chinese markets continue to balance the risk of renewed tariffs from the US with recent signs of optimism from their own economy after targeted stimulus had a positive impact. Japan held steady as yen weakness offset export headwinds. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar showed resilience, suggesting traders are not panicking yet, and hope that it is just more posturing from Donald Trump before scaling back again. Meanwhile, Bitcoin made new all-time highs, ignoring traditional risk sentiment. The move higher reflects both a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty and growing speculation around new ETF inflows and central bank pressures. Tariff headlines will continue to create short-term volatility in the markets, whilst Bitcoin’s surge may be reflecting broader anti-fiat sentiment, rather than risk-on appetite. We should watch how the markets react to any further developments, and whether they see it as a real threat to the global economy and a potential escalation, or more political posturing from Trump.

Larger-than-expected drop in inflation puts August rate cut back on the table The larger-than-expected fall in India’s consumer price inflation to 2.1% y/y in June raises the prospect of the RBI cutting interest rates further at its policy meeting next month. But given the RBI delivered a bumper 50bp rate cut last month and clearly signalled that its easing cycle was over, we suspect that the high bar for further easing has not been cleared. The headline rate eased from 2.8% y/y in May to 2.1% in June, its lowest rate since January 2019, which was a bigger drop than both we and the consensus had expected (CE forecast: 2.6%; LSEG consensus: 2.5%). We will get the full breakdown shortly, but our Food CPI nowcast suggests that food inflation continued to edge lower last month. We suspect inflation bottomed out in June, but it is likely to rise only gradually towards the RBI’s 4% target over the rest of the year. Underlying price pressures are likely to build further as the economy continues to grow at a robust pace, pushing up core inflation. But, while food prices can be extremely volatile in India, supportive weather conditions should keep them in check over the coming months. In terms of the policy implications, June’s softer-than-expected inflation data – the last set of inflation numbers before the RBI’s next policy announcement on 6th August – certainly increases the prospects of another interest rate cut. That said, the fact that the RBI delivered a sizeable 50bp cut in June and in its communications hinted that the easing cycle was now over by shifting its policy stance from “accommodative” to “neutral” suggests to us that the bar to a resumption in the easing cycle is high. As a result, we are sticking to our view that policy settings will be left on hold in August. And a gradual pick-up in inflation over the coming year suggests that the RBI can leave the repo rate at 5.50% well into 2026. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Recent Interview...

Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) surpassed $5 billion in net inflows on July 11, just 12 trading days after crossing the $4 billion mark, according to Farside Investors data. The milestone reflects a faster pace than the previous interval, when the products required 15 trading sessions to add the prior $1 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) contributed a large portion of the most recent inflows. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that ETHA recorded $675 million in weekly net subscriptions, placing it sixth across all US ETFs for the period ending July 11. He framed ETHA’s weekly haul as a significant moment, noting on July 12 that the vehicle is “hanging with the big dogs for the first time.” The fund closed the week ahead of traditional equity and bond vehicles despite operating in the shadow of larger Bitcoin products. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, absorbed $1.7 billion over the same span. Ethereum ETFs launched on July 23, 2024, and crossed $4 billion in cumulative flows on June 23, achieving this milestone in 231 trading days. The first $3 billion required 216 sessions. By contrast, the jump from $4 billion to $5 billion occurred in just over two weeks of trading, including five consecutive days with total inflows exceeding $200 million. Aggregate daily data from July show that ETHA alone drew $300.9 million on July 10, followed by $158.6 million on July 9 and $137.1 million on July 11. Other issuers such as Fidelity (FETH) and Bitwise (ETHW) posted consistent additions, while Grayscale’s legacy ETHE product saw redemptions. Due to the recent additions, spot Ethereum ETFs now represent over 10% of the total inflows of Bitcoin ETFs traded in the US.

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/14/2025 12:52:53 PM PDT by NoLibZone Despite having called Bitcoin BTC +0.59% an "immature asset class" that is inappropriate for long-term investors, Vanguard Group has become the largest shareholder in Strategy, according to a report from Bloomberg. Through its funds, the $10-trillion money manager owns 20 million Strategy shares or 8% of the outstanding common stock, according to a Bloomberg chart. Vanguard most likely passed Capital Group Cos. to become the top shareholder of Strategy shares during the fourth quarter, the report said. Strategy (ticker MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become a proxy bet for Bitcoin as the company's chief business proposition has been acquiring BTC. Consequently, Strategy's share price has risen in unison with the price of Bitcoin, driving other companies to pursue crypto treasury strategies. With multi-billion-dollar spot Bitcoin ETFs issued by Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, and nations all around the world adopting or embracing not only BTC but digital assets in general, demand has never been greater. Bitcoin earlier today hit an all-time high and surpassed the $120,000 level. Also on Monday, Strategy, which is co-founded by executive chairman Michael Saylor, purchased another 4,225 BTC for approximately $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 601,550 BTC.

Title: Vanguard Becomes the Accidental Strategy Whale
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/14/vanguard-accidentally-becomes-largest-holder-of-strategy-stock-despite-anti-bitcoin-stance
Time Published: 2025-07-14T19:47:01Z
Full Content:
Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to bitcoin ETFs, has emerged as the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), a company whose business model is built around buying and holding bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, Vanguard now owns more than 20 million shares of MSTR — over 8% of the company — surpassing Capital Group as the top institutional holder. The stake is worth about $9.26 billion. "God has a sense of humor," said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. "Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally." "Institutional dementia," said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. “Indexing into $9 billion of what you openly mock isn't strategy,” he wrote in a post on X. Vanguard's exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategy’s strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguard’s funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria. Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about $72 billion since 2020. The company’s shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over $80 billion in assets. Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasn't shifted the firm’s position. “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji said after his appointment.
