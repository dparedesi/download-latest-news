Title: SEC crypto task force to meet, with a spotlight on tokenization – Details

From the next steps for crypto to new blockchain shifts, here’s what we know. As the SEC’s Crypto Task Force prepares for its round table discussion, the backdrop is anything but quiet. The Roundtable on “Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain” kicks off tomorrow, and the sector braces for what’s dubbed a “spring sprint toward crypto clarity.” From BlackRock’s talks with regulators to the unexpected failure of the GENIUS Act in the Senate, the signals are clear – debates over the regulatory future of digital assets are heating up. Adding another dimension, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has outlined a bold new chapter for the blockchain platform; a shift toward faster development and more inclusive innovation in 2025. The U.S. SEC’s Digital Assets Task Force will hold its fourth Digital Asset Roundtable on the 12th of May, further reinforcing the growing intersection between TradFi and DeFi. Key SEC figures, including Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, will deliver opening remarks, with Peirce highlighting tokenization’s transformative potential. The agenda includes speakers from major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, indicating increasing institutional engagement. Just days before the roundtable, stablecoin regulation hit a snag. On the 8th of May, the GENIUS Act – a long-anticipated stablecoin regulation bill – surprisingly failed to advance after a narrow 49-48 vote. The setback was driven by a notable shift among several Democrats who had earlier backed the legislation. Source: mailchi.mp Lawmakers, including Ruben Gallego and Lisa Blunt Rochester, cited national security risks, insufficient consumer protections, and gaps in anti-money laundering provisions as reasons for their reversal. Their joint statement called for tighter oversight, putting regulatory clarity on pause yet again. As institutional players deepen their engagement, BlackRock met with the SEC Crypto Task Force on the 9th of May to discuss a detailed agenda spanning staking, tokenization, and crypto ETP approval standards. Of course, BlackRock’s presence signaled more than curiosity—it was a deliberate push to define compliance in crypto investing. Source: X In parallel, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, announced a strategic shift in philosophy, departing from its traditionally slow, academically rigorous development model. In a candid update, he emphasized the urgency of delivering “Leios by 2026, not 2028,” justifying recent team contract terminations to prioritize speed and innovation. Hoskinson spotlighted Aiken and Midgard—new teams focused on modularity and speed, marking a break from Cardano’s early academic model. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sector is recalibrating toward faster execution and greater regulatory clarity.

Geopolitical Battleground: The Panama Canal is a critical trade and military chokepoint where U.S.-China tensions escalate, with Panama divided over American retreat and Chinese infrastructure expansion. Chinese Influence Grows: China is gaining control through ports, migration, and economic projects, filling the vacuum left by the U.S. after its 1999 handover of canal operations. Military & Economic Risks: The canal enables U.S. naval mobility; Chinese dominance could disrupt supply chains or sabotage the waterway by targeting key infrastructure like the Gatun Dam. Global Trade at Stake: Similar struggles exist in the Suez, Hormuz, and Malacca straits, where China exploits U.S. disengagement to reshape global trade routes in its favor. Urgent U.S. Action Needed: Without a stronger U.S. response, China may seize control, threatening Americaâs economic and military dominanceâexperts warn Washington must act before itâs too late.

The Panama Canal, a linchpin of global trade, has become the latest battleground in the escalating geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. As tensions rise, Panamanians are dividedâsome urging Washington to reassert influence, while others fear Chinese colonization through infrastructure investments. Experts warn that losing control of this critical waterway could cripple U.S. economic and military logistics, leaving China poised to exploit the vacuum left by American retreat. A Strategic Waterway Under Threat The Panama Canal, which handles 70% of U.S. trade for both coasts, remains one of the most vital maritime chokepoints in the world. Yet, since the U.S. handed over control to Panama in 1999 under President Carter (finalized by Clinton), American influence has wanedâwhile China has steadily expanded its footprint. Michael Yon, a geopolitical analyst who recently returned from Panama, warns that China is "colonizing" the country through infrastructure projects, commercial ports, and migration. "The Chinese are taking over positions of power, mostly behind the scenes," Yon explained in an interview with Mike Adams on Brighton.com. "Theyâre building bridges, controlling ports, and subtly shifting demographicsâjust like they did in Hong Kong." U.S. Retreat, Chinese Expansion The Biden administration has continued the Obama-era policy of disengagement, while Chinaâs state-linked firms like Hutchison Ports now operate key terminals on both sides of the canal. BlackRock, a major U.S. asset manager with deep ties to China, has also sought to acquire these portsâraising concerns about de facto Chinese control over critical trade routes. Yon notes that Panamanian ship pilots guide every vesselâincluding U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriersâthrough the canal, a stark contrast to the past when American operators dominated. "The Panamanians ask, Where are the Americans? We left a vacuum, and China filled it," he said. Military and Economic Stakes The canal is not just an economic artery but a military lifeline for the U.S. Navy, allowing rapid deployment between the Atlantic and Pacific. If China gains dominance, it could strangle U.S. supply chains in a conflictâor even sabotage the canal by targeting the Gatun Dam, which, if destroyed, would drain the canalâs freshwater supply and shut it down for years. Trumpâs aggressive stanceâincluding threats to seize control of the canalâhas drawn mixed reactions. Some Panamanians welcome U.S. protection, while nationalists resist foreign intervention. "Panama is a juicy lamb surrounded by predators," Yon warned. "If the U.S. doesnât act, China or others will take it." Broader Geopolitical Chessboard The canal crisis mirrors struggles elsewhere: Suez Canal: China, Russia, and Egypt are forming alliances, exploiting perceived U.S. weakness. Strait of Hormuz: A potential U.S.-Iran conflict could disrupt 30% of global oil shipments, devastating Europe. Strait of Malacca: China is building rail bypasses to reduce reliance on this chokepoint. Whatâs Next? With Trump pushing tariffs and Bidenâs passive stance, the U.S. risks losing its grip on global trade routes. Meanwhile, Chinaâs "debt-trap diplomacy" and infrastructure investments are reshaping the Americasâfrom Panama to Argentina. As Yon starkly put it: "If China takes the Panama Canal, they can strangle us to death." The question is: Will Washington wake up before itâs too late?

Title: Degrees without CAO points were meant to be a ‘game changer’. Why do so few students avail of them?

Cullain Burke’s delight with his Leaving Certificate results was short-lived. The 424 points he achieved in 2023 were not enough to secure his dream course, software development at Munster Technological University (MTU), which had soared above 500 points. “I was a little bit devastated to miss out,” he says. “It was upsetting. All my friends were going there. I had enough points for a business course, but I knew, really, it wasn’t something I’d be interested in.” As he weighed up whether to complete a post-Leaving Cert course, Burke was told of a brand new option: tertiary degrees. They are regular university bachelor’s degrees which begin in a further education college and finish up in a higher education institution. Entry is not based on CAO points and there are no tuition fees for the first one to two years. [ ‘No points needed, just potential’: Forty college degrees open for applicants outside CAO systemOpens in new window ] As it happened, there was a new tertiary degree in software development, with the first two years at Cork College of Further Education and Training and the final two years at MTU. “I thought, ‘there’s no way it’s real – it’s too good to be true’,” Burke recalls. “It’s far cheaper. It’s even closer to home. And it meant I’d have full access to all the facilities at MTU and could keep in contact with my friends.” Tertiary degrees were announced in a blaze of publicity three years ago by then minister for higher education, Simon Harris. They were, he said, a “game-changer” and had the potential to lift the stress on students forced to compete in a highly competitive CAO points race for college places. “These [tertiary] third-level courses challenge the notion that your Leaving Cert results should determine your education and career path, define a person or their capabilities, or get in the way of their dreams,” he said, shortly after the launch of the scheme. “With these courses I want to send a clear message to young people and their parents when considering options after school: you can be an engineer, a nurse, study business or work in ICT without ever having to worry about those archaic and stressful Leaving Cert points.” Yet, three years into the operation of the initiative, the numbers taking part are disappointing. A total of 152 students started courses during the first intake in 2023 across 14 different degrees. Last year the number climbed to 224 tertiary students. By comparison, the CAO this year received a record 83,000-plus applications, up from almost 77,000 last year. [ Could my son really lose a college offer if his CAO details are incorrect?Opens in new window ] So, why haven’t tertiary degree options caught the imagination of school leavers? One chair of a further education college board, who declined to be named, questioned the extent to which higher education institutions have bought into the scheme. “If you look at the courses on offer, they tend not to be the ones in high demand through the CAO,” the source said. “In many cases, they are courses the colleges are struggling to fill anyway. Until you see the really high points courses on offer, it won’t be the game-changer it was intended to be.” The most popular tertiary degree routes so far are for courses in nursing. While it used to attract high points, it has fallen to between 340 and 420 points in recent years. Some tertiary courses have not had any participants. Burke feels numbers taking part are relatively low because students are not aware of it, as well as a lingering stigma over further education being “second best”. “There can be a feeling that if you’re not going straight into [University College Cork] or MTU, then you’re not really progressing properly,” says Burke, from Blackrock in Cork. “This is completely not the case.” Another senior education observer points to the “rushed” manner in which tertiary degrees were introduced. [ Many apprentices are now on higher salaries than college graduates. Is snobbery around ‘earn and learn’ options fading?Opens in new window ] “I think Harris wanted it done in a hurry, with details to be thrashed out later. So, there are still unresolved issues around pay rates for staff in [Further Education and Training] colleges and poor linkages with traditional universities. Like it or not, they’re still seen as having a higher status.” There are some signs of change, however. University College Cork (UCC) is the first traditional university to offer tertiary degrees. One of its offerings is a BSc in occupational therapy, which had CAO entry points in excess of 500 points last year. Tanya Jones, deputy director of the National Tertiary Office, which oversees the roll-out of the new offerings, says demand is increasing. A total of 38 tertiary degrees are on offer this year across business, ICT, arts, engineering, social sciences, early learning & care, agricultural science, sport, construction and nursing. More programmes are now being designed in partnership with industry to tackle skills shortages and equip students for careers in sectors that need them. “Whether you’re finishing school, returning to education, or upskilling later in life, tertiary bachelors’ degrees are about meeting you where you are and helping you get to where you want to go,” Jones said. “Options and demand are increasing year on year, demonstrating the need for and importance of a more accessible route like the one presented by tertiary bachelors’ degrees.” These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education. Nessa White, executive director for transformation at Solas, the State body which oversees the further education and training (FET) sector, adds that a key differentiating factor for tertiary degrees is that they are much more accessible. The fact that further education is available in almost every community across Ireland is, she says, creating a “supportive and tailored environment where people can develop their abilities and skills.” “This makes it a great platform for progression to higher education,” she said. Minister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless is convinced that the pathway will grow and give more students than ever the chance to pursue their ambitions without being tied down by the CAO points race. “I understand that many young people feel anxious about their educational future, worrying each year if their Leaving Certificate results will be enough to get into the course they want,” he said. “These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education.” Burke, meanwhile, is on course to progress into the third year of his BSc in software development at MTU in September, having completed two years at Cork College of FET. He says he values the one-to-one help he received in a further education setting, while smaller class sizes in first year meant the transition from secondary school wasn’t as daunting. “If you need help in class, there’s never an issue. There’s a big emphasis on learning by doing ... you’re not just sitting in a lecture hall and listening.” While he knows some students have struggled in university, Burke feels he has a more solid foundation of learning. His dream of working as a data scientist is alive and well. “I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen to me to try this as an option. I’m excited to be gong to MTU in September ... I couldn’t recommend it highly enough.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump prizes more Gulf investment in the US

With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy. "President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US]," says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank. "He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing." Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May. The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April. Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico. Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his "America First" agenda is delivering results. The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton. The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years. Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (£450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn, including purchases of more US military equipment. According to Ali Shihabi – a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government – a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip. "These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods," says Mr Shihabi. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid. Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington. Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken "with a little bit of a grain of salt". Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items. These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft. The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen. The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder. The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction. Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a "more efficient procurement system", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily. "The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately," he adds. Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil. The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub. Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states. The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE. "For the UAE, this is absolutely essential," says Ms Young. "They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best." While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program. Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil. It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports. However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital. The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals. Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output. Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump, who has called for lower oil prices. Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing. The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries. It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education. "The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies," Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC. Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit. For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda. "President Trump is looking for a headline of big investments in America, and he will get that from this trip," adds Mr Shihabi. Chinese online retailers had previously relied on the "de minimis" loophole to ship low-value items to the US. The government insists hormone-fed beef will not appear in the UK, but farmers still have questions. It is not an end to the trade war, but it is a significant truce, writes the BBC's economics editor. Trump says he'd be "stupid" to not accept the aircraft "free of charge", after Qatar denied it amounted to a gift.

The biggest asset manager in the world met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss several aspects of its crypto market regulation. According to a new memo, asset management giant BlackRock met with the SEC Crypto Task Force to discuss crypto staking, asset tokenization, the firm’s suite of digital asset products, crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) approval standards, as well as options on crypto ETPs. “On May 9th, 2025, Crypto Task Force Staff met with representatives from BlackRock, Inc. The topic discussed was approaches to addressing issues related to the regulation of crypto assets.” The SEC Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, was launched in January 2025 by then Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda to create clear crypto guidelines and provide realistic paths to registration. Earlier this month, BlackRock, which has over $11 trillion under its management, continued its expansion into the world of digital assets as it purchased billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC), the top crypto asset by market cap. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries reveals that the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), BlackRock’s BTC-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), currently has 620,252 BTC worth about $64.327 billion. IBIT, which was launched in January 2024, is currently the largest BTC-based ETF and holds the record for the most successful ETF launch in history. Bitcoin is trading for $103,213 at time of writing, a marginal increase during the last 24 hours.

Title: How To Invest In Web3 In 2025

Time Published: 2025-05-11T13:00:00Z

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. Web3’s growth is transforming industries, from finance to gaming. Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, where decentralized networks, blockchain and digital assets reshape how we interact, own and transact. As interest grows, investors are exploring ways to get started, with choosing the right Web3 wallet being a key first step. This guide covers secure asset management, digital assets, DeFi, and the intersection of AI and blockchain. In 2025, Web3 is a key part of the digital economy, with blockchain technology powering applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Major institutions like BlackRock have embraced its potential, with CEO Larry Fink comparing tokenization to “email itself” for assets. Real-world assets, such as stocks and real estate, are now easily tokenized and traded, offering faster, transparent transactions. Regulations have also improved, with discussions around clearer frameworks for blockchain, and U.S. lawmakers proposing bipartisan laws for digital assets. This regulatory progress and institutional adoption have made Web3 more secure and accessible for investors. Investing in Web3 offers access to a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized technologies that aim to transform industries ranging from finance and gaming to supply chain management and digital identity. Web3 assets, including cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance tokens, and non-fungible tokens, provide opportunities for diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Beyond diversification, Web3 investments can offer enhanced security, transparency and control over assets. Blockchain technology ensures that transactions are secure and verifiable, while decentralized platforms reduce reliance on intermediaries. As regulations become clearer, more institutions implement Web3 and new use cases appear, investment opportunities in the space keep growing. Investing in Web3 in 2025 offers a wide range of options, each catering to different interests and risk levels. You can buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana, explore decentralized AI platforms or invest in tokenized real-world assets like real estate. DeFi lets you earn interest or borrow without banks, while Web3-related stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) provide indirect exposure to digital assets. Play-to-earn gaming allows you to earn crypto through gameplay, and joining decentralized autonomous organizations offers a chance to participate in Web3 governance and decision-making. Understanding these options can help you build a diversified Web3 investment strategy. Cryptocurrencies are a direct way to invest in Web3. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold, while Solana offers fast transactions for decentralized apps. Stablecoins like USDC maintain a stable value by being pegged to traditional currencies. Investors can buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken and store them securely in Web3 wallets like MetaMask or Ledger. Since anyone can create a cryptocurrency, thorough research is essential. Evaluate each project’s team, technology, and security measures to avoid scams and protect your assets. Investing in decentralized AI is a way to support and profit from the next wave of artificial intelligence without relying on big tech companies. One of the best examples is Bittensor, a blockchain-based platform where anyone can help build and improve AI models. Instead of being controlled by a single company, Bittensor is a network where people can earn TAO tokens by creating, testing or refining AI tools. Bittensor’s unique setup uses “subnets,” which are smaller communities that focus on specific AI tasks, like language translation or image recognition. These subnets compete to provide the best results, and those who contribute useful work earn rewards. This decentralized approach makes Bittensor different from traditional AI companies, giving users more control and allowing anyone to take part. If you believe in the future of AI and want to invest, owning TAO tokens or supporting active subnets can be a good way to get involved. Real-world assets are physical or traditional financial assets represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. These can include anything from real estate and commodities to stocks and bonds. There are two main types of RWA tokens: fungible tokens, like ERC-20, which represent divisible assets (such as currencies or gold); and non-fungible tokens (NFTs, like ERC-721), which are used for unique assets like real estate or fine art. Tokenizing these assets allows them to be bought, sold and traded quickly and securely on blockchain networks. Investing in RWA’s through Web3 has several advantages. It makes these assets easier to trade, more transparent and more accessible. For example, instead of needing a large amount of money to buy an entire property, you can buy a small piece of it as a token. Blockchain technology also keeps records secure and accurate, making asset management simpler. As more assets get tokenized, this approach could become a central part of the Web3 world. Decentralized finance offers a way to invest in financial products without relying on traditional banks or intermediaries. Instead, DeFi uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized, transparent system where users can lend, borrow, trade and save with crypto assets. DeFi platforms, often accessed through dApps (decentralized applications), enable peer-to-peer transactions, instant loans and trading without brokers. Popular DeFi activities include lending crypto for interest, obtaining loans without paperwork, and trading assets directly with other users. Building on DeFi can include RWA’s. Tokenizing assets like real estate or commodities makes them usable within DeFi protocols, creating more liquidity and investment opportunities. For example, MakerDAO uses RWAs as collateral to issue its stablecoin, DAI. This blending of traditional and blockchain-based finance can lead to more diverse investment options while reducing systemic risks. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are online communities where members make decisions collectively without a central leader. They use blockchain technology and smart contracts which are automated programs carrying out actions when certain conditions are met. MakerDAO, one of the most well-known DAOs, runs on Ethereum and uses a protocol to maintain DAI, a cryptocurrency designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar without relying on banks or governments. Once you find a DAO that interests you, join the community, participate in discussions and complete tasks. Some DAOs require governance tokens, like MakerDAO’s MKR, which allows members to vote on proposals. DAI is created when users lock up assets like ETH as collateral, and members manage the system collectively to ensure DAI’s stability. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds offer a simple way to invest in bitcoin without directly owning it. These funds can be classified into two types: spot ETFs, which hold actual Bitcoin, and futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin price using contracts. Several Bitcoin ETFs offer diverse ways to invest in the cryptocurrency. ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) focuses on futures contracts, while ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) provide direct spot exposure. Among them, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) by BlackRock stands out due to its market capitalization, making it the most popular option. Ethereum-focused ETFs are available, each offering a range of investment options. Investing in crypto ETFs provides benefits like diversification and liquidity, but it also involves risks, such as counterparty risk and a lack of direct asset ownership. While there are other crypto-based ETFs and more are expected to launch, they are not established as Bitcoin-based ETFs. Play-to-earn crypto gaming lets players earn digital assets like cryptocurrencies or NFTs through in-game activities. Unlike traditional games where achievements have no real-world value, P2E games reward players with assets they can own, trade or sell. Built on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Solana, these games create player-driven economies where digital items hold actual value, making gaming a potential source of income. Popular P2E games include Axie Infinity, where players collect and battle creatures for tokens like SLP and AXS. In Decentraland, users can buy, sell and monetize virtual land using MANA tokens. The Sandbox offers a metaverse platform where players can create, own and trade digital assets using SAND tokens. These games show how blockchain technology can turn gaming into an investment opportunity. Investing in Web3 offers exciting opportunities but comes with significant risks. One of the critical challenges is security. Web3 wallets, which store digital assets, can be vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks or user mistakes. Choosing a secure Web3 wallet is essential, but even the best options can be compromised if users don’t follow good security practices. And because Web3 is decentralized, there’s often no customer support to help if something goes wrong. Regulatory uncertainty is another challenge. While proposed U.S. legislation is being evaluated, a concrete structure has yet to be implemented. Market volatility is also a concern, with Web3 assets experiencing sudden price swings. Finally, with so many new projects launching, investors risk putting money into scams, poorly managed platforms or unsustainable ventures. Bottom Line Investing in Web3 offers exciting opportunities, but it comes with risks. Security is a major concern, so choosing a secure Web3 wallet and practicing safe habits is essential. Regulatory uncertainty and market volatility also pose challenges, making thorough research crucial for avoiding scams and making informed investment decisions. Web3’s growth is transforming industries, from finance to gaming. Popular options include crypto ETFs, play-to-earn games, decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets. Understanding these options and their risks can help you navigate this rapidly evolving space. Web3 can be a good investment in 2025 for those who understand its risks and opportunities. While it offers access to innovative technologies and new financial models, investors must navigate security concerns, regulatory changes and market volatility. The best cryptocurrency to invest in is likely Bitcoin, given its proven track record and status as the most secure digital asset. For those considering branching out, it’s essential to understand your risk tolerance and thoroughly research each project before investing. To start investing in Web3, set up a secure Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask or Ledger, and choose a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. From there, you can explore options like buying cryptocurrencies, participating in DeFi, joining DAOs or investing in Web3-related stocks and ETFs. The biggest risks of Web3 investing include security vulnerabilities, such as wallet hacks or phishing attacks, and regulatory uncertainty, which can impact the value of digital assets. Market volatility and the risk of investing in poorly managed or fraudulent projects are also major concerns.

Title: Germany: New Merz cabinet raises concerns over lobbying
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-new-merz-cabinet-raises-concerns-over-lobbying/a-72491832

Full Content:
No sooner had Friedrich Merz announced new government positions than accusations of "lobbyism" began to fly. How is lobbying regulated in Germany — and how big a problem is it? Newly elected Chancellor Friedrich Merz, from the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), himself a former lobbyist for global investment firm BlackRock, has taken the somewhat unusual step in German politics of appointing three people directly from the world of business to top cabinet jobs. The new minister of economic affairs and energy is Katherina Reiche (CDU), returning to government after a stint as managing director of the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU) and CEO of energy provider Westenergie, a subsidiary of one of Europe's largest energy concerns E.ON since 2020. The environmentalist Green Party, now back in opposition, has described her as a "gas lobbyist." Germany's new culture and media commissioner is media entrepreneur Wolfram Weimer, a former editor-in-chief of right-wing newspaper Welt with no previous experience in government of any kind. The Weimer Media Group founded by Weimer and his wife Christiane Goetz-Weimer hosts annual meetings where power players from business, politics and media gather to network. Since his appointment to the cabinet, Weimer has announced that his wife will now take over as sole managing director of the media group. The new minister for digitalization and state modernization, Karsten Wildberger, gave up his job as CEO of listed electronics retail group Ceconomy, parent company of two of Germany's largest consumer electronics chains MediaMarkt and Saturn, in order to take up his new job. Like Weimer, Wildberger has never been a politician, elected or otherwise. The socialist Left Party co-leader Ines Schwedtner criticized the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU/CSU's coalition partner in government, for supporting what she called a "CDU lobbyist cabinet." While it's not the norm that people from business move straight into cabinet positions in Germany, it is becoming more common, according to Norman Loeckel, an expert on lobbying regulation at anti-corruption organization Transparency Germany. "It's actually better if you take someone who has the knowledge and expertise than a member of parliament who doesn't. But if there is a conflict of interest, that is a very critical situation and there are no rules curtailing this effectively in Germany," Loeckel told DW. Lobbying refers to the phenomenon of interest groups attempting to influence political decision-making in their favor, and is central to the functioning of a pluralistic democracy. Interest groups can include trade and consumer associations, NGOs, charities, foundations, churches, PR agencies that lobby on behalf of clients, think tanks and other research institutes, and state actors such as municipalities or federal ministries. As of 2022, lobbyists in Germany must register in a database called the Lobby Register. This includes all those who contact members of parliament, their staff, parliamentary groups and the federal government. But there are exceptions: Churches, trade unions and employers' associations are not required by law to register, although they may do so voluntarily. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Anyone who intentionally or negligently fails to register or update information correctly and completely, or not in a timely manner, could be prosecuted under the Lobby Register Act and be hit with a fine of up to €50,000 ($57,000). Donations to political parties over €10,000 must be published. It was also decided in 2021 that members of the Bundestag would have to declare company shareholdings and additional income of over €1,000 per month or €3,000 per year. Lawmakers also must abide by the Member of Parliament Act which regulates what secondary activities and income must be declared. It explicitly states that it is illegal to accept money or benefits of a monetary value in return for representing, promoting or protecting particular interests. Cabinet ministers are barred from working any type of second job under the Federal Ministers Act, even on a voluntary basis — but this does not apply to the majority of members of parliament who are not in the cabinet. Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers who want to switch from politics to business must notify the authorities if they intend to take up employment outside of the public sector. They can be subject to a mandatory "cooling-off" period of up to 18 months. In Germany, more lobbyists have access to the German Bundestag than there are members of parliament. There are currently almost 6,000 companies, associations, organizations, networks, individuals and others on the register — the list of designated employees who directly represent their interests numbers more than 27,000. Anti-corruption campaign groups, including Transparency Germany and Lobbycontrol, have also long called for the introduction of a so-called "executive footprint" documenting how federal bills came into being. The proposal has found its way into the rules of procedure for government ministries, but these rules are not binding and those who violate them do not face consequences. "In general in Germany, unless there is a big scandal, nothing happens. Almost all of the rules in Germany that limits lobbying, that bind politicians to certain rules, came into being because of a scandal," Loeckel told DW. The push for Germany's Lobby Register that led to its introduction in 2022 gained momentum in 2020 after CDU politician Philipp Amthor lobbied for US company Augustus Intelligence in return for stock options. Amthor also wrote letters to the Economy Ministry seeking "political support" for the startup of which he was also a board member. Cabinet ministers may be barred from having second jobs under the Member of Parliament Act, but this does not apply to other members of the Bundestag. Members of parliament are also not obliged to disclose any assets they or their family members own, aside from company shareholdings of over 5%. The Member of Parliament Act also does not apply to cabinet members like Reiche, Wildberger and Weimer who are not elected members of the Bundestag. "The only law that ministers have to obey is the Federal Minister Act. In reality the only real regulation is that cabinet ministers cannot have second jobs and that there must be a cooling-off period before switching from politics to business," said Loeckel. The cooling-off period was introduced in 2015 after a number of scandals, most prominently involving former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the SPD. Shortly before leaving office in 2005, Schröder signed a deal between Germany and Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the NordStream 1 gas pipeline, and then joined the board of directors of the NordStream joint venture. While the so-called "revolving door" between business and politics may be slowed by the cooling-off period, Transparency Germany wants this extended from a minimum of 18 months to a maximum of three years if conflicts arise. "In theory, you also have the code of conduct but it is not a law and you can break the rules and nobody will care. If there's no scandal there's no problem, at least from their point of view," said Loeckel.

Despite political backlash, 85 percent of executives remain committed to inclusion efforts. The debate hinges on whether corporate Americaâs stance holds under escalating legal and political scrutiny. While the populist narrative claims that MAGA-aligned forces are dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across corporate America,Â some of the nation's largest companies are refusing to back down. Shareholders at Costco, Apple, Leviâs, John Deere and Goldman Sachs have rejected proposals to scrap DEI programs, despite pressure from conservative activists. In recent months, conservative think tanks like the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) have spearheaded shareholder proposals demanding companies abandon DEI policies, citing legal risks and accusations of "reverse discrimination." At Costco, more than 98 percent of shareholders voted against a proposal to audit DEI-related business risks, with the board arguing diversity strengthens customer satisfaction. Similar defeats unfolded at Apple, Levi's and Goldman Sachs. (Related: Meta scraps DEI initiatives amid broader corporate retreat from diversity policies.) Why DEI still has corporate backing DEI programs encompass hiring practices, leadership training and supplier diversity efforts aimed at increasing representation for women, minorities, veterans and people with disabilities. CriticsÂ like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO and close advisor to President Donald Trump, say DEI represents "reverse racism." Major institutional investors â BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street â control vast voting shares and typically side with management. Their resistance to anti-DEI measures suggests Wall Street sees financial value in these programs, regardless of political headwinds. Opponents claim DEI violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against race-based college admissions. However, that decision applies only to public institutions, not private corporations. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aggressively targeted DEI, pressuring companies like Meta and Target to scale back initiatives under threat of lost federal contracts. Yet, shareholder votes reveal a disconnect. While some firms quietly retreat, others â like Costco and Cisco â are digging in. Conservative groups admit their proposals are less about winning votes and more about applying pressure. The NLPC withdrew a similar motion at PepsiCo after the company agreed to drop minority representation goals for managers. Despite political rhetoric, DEI isnât disappearing. Companies are rebranding initiativesâdropping the term "DEI" while maintaining diversity hiring pipelines.

Title: Obituary: David Doyle, businessman and son of of legendary hotelier whose time in charge of the family business repeatedly hit the headlines

Time Published: 2025-05-11T01:30:00Z
Full Content:
David Doyle became a shrewd investor and a successful hotelier David Doyle, whose ­private funeral was held in ­Dublin last Thursday, was the younger son of legendary hotelier Pascal Vincent (PV) Doyle and took over the mantle of running the Doyle Hotel group for a time following the sudden death of his father, who had built the international chain of hotels from scratch. Mr Doyle, who lived between his home in Spain and his mansion on Shrewsbury Road in Dublin, died at the age of 67 on May 2 after living with motor neurone disease for some time. David Doyle was the second youngest of the five children of the builder and hotelier PV Doyle and his wife Margaret: Michael, Eileen, Anne, David and Bernadette. He grew up in the family mansion, Thornhill, in spacious grounds in Mount Merrion, Co Dublin, beside the Cherrygarth Estate which his father built. He went to school in Blackrock College and the College of Catering in Cathal Brugha Street, Dublin. Although born with the proverbial silver spoon, David, like his siblings, was expected to work in the family business. From about the age of 12 he learned his trade in the kitchens and bars of the Doyle hotels, ­before going to the US to work in the ­famous ­Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los ­Angeles. I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business On returning to Dublin, he was appointed an assistant manager in his father’s flagship hotel, the Berkeley Court in Ballsbridge, built in the grounds of the former Trinity College Botanical Gardens and, in the mid-1980s, it was the most stylish hotel in Dublin. “I can’t honestly say that there was a time when I didn’t want to go into the hotel business,” he later admitted. When PV died suddenly in 1988 at the age of 64, it seemed the ­pecking order within the family had ­already been settled. Although he left everything to his wife Margaret, ­David became chief executive of the hotel group, with his younger sister Bernie (Bernadette) retaining her ­position as international marketing executive and second in command. Their elder brother Michael had taken over the building arm of the family business. “David and Bernie complemented each other and they were exceptionally close,” said one insider at the time. “He was running the business and she was marketing manager and they had offices next door to each other in the Burlington Hotel. It seemed like the ideal way to run the business.” His best friend at the time was ­another ambitious young Dublin ­hotel executive, John Fitzpatrick, whose ­father, Paddy, was a well-known figure in the hotel business. Their sons hung out with a “rat pack” of well-heeled bachelor friends. John Fitzpatrick returned from New York, where he had been ­dispatched by his father to open and run Fitzpatrick’s Hotel in Manhattan, to be best man when David Doyle married former air hostess Christina Kelly at a lavish wedding in Dublin. Some of his friends, who included Gerry Purcell, Michael Smurfit Jr, John Gallagher, Des McEvaddy and Paul Doody, hired a small aeroplane to fly over the church in Foxrock trailing a banner saying “your goose is cooked” that Saturday, May 4, 1991. However, over the next two years tensions within the Doyle family began to manifest, with his three sisters — including Bernie who was now married to John Gallagher — unhappy at the direction the business was taking. “It was generally felt in the industry that David and the family had a falling out over his policy of heavy investment in the existing hotel properties,” reported The Irish Times. Adding to the tension was David Doyle’s confidence in his own ability. “PV was frequently described paradoxically as a benevolent autocrat. Unfortunately, David appeared to have inherited his father’s iron will and tendency to take decisions without bothering too much about extensive consultations,” read one profile. David Doyle also wanted to team up with the worldwide Marriott chain to put the brand name on some of the hotels in the group. This did not find favour with the family matriarch, Margaret, who ultimately controlled the business and regarded “Doyle” as a ­better calling card. After a series of boardroom clashes David called senior hotel staff together on the evening of Wednesday June 15, 1994, and with tears in his eyes told them he was leaving the family ­business. “It is no secret in the financial world that PV’s widow ­Margaret and her five children and their respective wives and husbands are deeply divided,” wrote Sunday ­Independent social diarist Trevor Danker, later that year. Then just as suddenly as he had left to “pursue other interests”, the Doyle Hotel Group announced that David Doyle was back. Under the new arrangement his mother gave up her controlling interest to her five children. David became managing director, with Bernie taking the role of deputy chairman. Executive Paddy Galvin, who had run Waterford Glass, was appointed chairman. Some years earlier David had been asked about how he got on with other members of his family, particularly his father: “Every day we have hundreds of disagreements — that’s what business is about,” he answered. Within a short time fundamental differences resurfaced. Elder brother Michael made it clear as soon as the in-fighting resumed that he wanted out. It is estimated that he got over £20m, with his share of the company divided among the remaining siblings. ­David offered to buy out his sisters for £100m. They turned him down. On July 4, 1997, it was announced in a terse statement that the board of the company had voted him out of office and Bernadette would resume the position. Two years later the family reached a settlement and David sold out all but a small percentage of his holding for £40m. He spent the remainder of his life as a shrewd investor in a range of business ventures in Ireland and abroad. He would figure briefly in another corporate battle. In 1999 the Doyle sisters agreed to merge with their Ballsbridge rivals to form a public company, Jury’s Doyle. Between them they walked away with £398m in cash and retained a 23pc stake in the new company, making them three of the richest women in Ireland. The only stipulation PV’s widow made to the deal was that her husband’s portrait should continue to hang in pride of place in the lobbies of the hotels he had founded. In 2005, what became known as the Battle of Ballsbridge commenced as canny developers realised some of the sites in the Jury’s Doyle hotel group were worth more than the buildings that occupied them. As 13 rival consortia hoovered up shares in Jury’s Doyle, the prime site, Jury’s Hotel, was put up for sale. In the end it was sold to developer Seán Dunne for €275m, and he threw in another €119m to acquire the adjacent Berkeley Court Hotel. In return he sold a huge parcel of shares in Jury’s Doyle back to the three Doyle sisters, who got most of their father’s hotels back and realigned the business as The Doyle Collection. When David Doyle sold his 1.2 million shares in Jury’s Doyle back to his sisters, he is believed to have netted another €40m, as the shares were driven sky high in the bidding war. David Doyle lived well off the fortune he made from the family business. His brother Michael was mentioned in his death notice, but not his three sisters. He died in Spain and is survived by his wife Christina and their daughters Ashley and Sophie. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock Meets With SEC To Discuss Staking, Tokenization, Others – Details

Executives of American investment firm BlackRock met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ‘s crypto task force on Friday to discuss various matters pertaining to cryptocurrency spot exchange-traded products (ETPs). This discussion, among other recent developments in the administration of US President Donald Trump, represents the growing American interest in the crypto industry. According to a memo released by the SEC on Friday, BlackRock representatives met the agency’s crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Pierce, to “address several issues related to regulation in crypto assets.” In particular, the briefing between both parties touched on staking in ETFs, which has become a major talking point in recent months. In particular, BlackRock sought to discuss the Commission’s perspective on staking and the potential for permitting exchange-traded funds with staking options. Notably, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) filed for a proposed rule change in February that will introduce staking in the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. If the SEC approves this application, Grayscale would be allowed to lock up portions of the crypto assets in its ETF holdings to generate additional income for the Trust. In April, the SEC delayed a decision on this request. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously stated there is much potential for the Commission to hold approval until the final deadline in October, despite the intermediate deadlines in May and August. In addition to Grayscale, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) has also filed a similar request for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. Aside from staking in ETFs, BlackRock and the SEC also conversed on ways of advancing the tokenization of securities in line with existing federal securities laws. Notably, BlackRock offers the BUIDL token, which is a tokenized money market fund that invests in high-quality government securities such as treasury bills. Furthermore, both parties also discussed the need for clear standards that determine the rejection or approval of a crypto ETP, which would also consider the provisions of Section 6 of the Exchange Act that ensure ETP trading will only happen on a regulated exchange. While this framework is being drafted, BlackRock also proposed the creation of a temporary regulatory system for ETP issuer activity. The final talking point between both parties explored the requirements for setting positions and exercise limits on crypto ETPs trading options, with a focus on how the liquidity of the underlying assets influences those limits. At presstime, the total crypto market is valued at $3.22 trillion following a 1.19% gain in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Files For In-Kind Creation/Redemption For Ethereum Spot ETF – Details

American investment firm BlackRock has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that will allow the in-kind creation and redemption of its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). This development comes three months after the asset manager made a similar application for its Bitcoin spot ETF. On May 9, BlackRock filed an amendment to the S-1 form of the Ethereum spot ETF ETHA that would permit an in-kind creation and redemption process for the fund. For context, crypto spot ETFs generally operate a cash creation and redemption process where authorized participants exchange cash for shares of an ETF. At the point of redemption, these shares are returned for the equivalent of their cash value. However, in an in-kind system, shares are directly exchanged for the base cryptocurrency between investors and the ETF issuers. This system allows ETF issuers to directly increase their cryptocurrency holdings without parting ways with any available cash. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, BlackRock’s application represents the first to push for in-kind creation/redemption in Ethereum ETFs after the asset manager filed a similar one for the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in January 2025. Notably, there is a final deadline around November 10, 2025, at which the SEC is expected to give a definite response to this proposed change on BlackRock’s ETHA. In BlackRock’s S-1 amendment for an in-kind creation/redemption system, the asset manager highlights multiple risks, which can be described as the conventional risks all investors should know before directly or indirectly engaging with the crypto market. In particular, James Seyffart draws attention to a whole paragraph on the risk of Quantum computing. Here, BlackRock warns that significant advancements in Quantum computing in the coming years might provide opportunities to attack the cryptographic algorithm of digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, thereby undermining the assets’ security. Although there are steps by certain network members to create a cryptographic algorithm that would be immune to Quantum computing developments, there is little evidence to show that such Quantum-proof systems can be completely built or even implemented without causing network forks. However, Seyffart tells investors that there is no cause for alarm; these are part of the basic risks of digital assets, which BlackRock is mandated to disclose. Other dangers mentioned in the amendment proposal include potential exchange collapse, e.g, FTX, governance policy, and volatility. At press time, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,347 following a 28.38% gain in the past week. Meanwhile, the altcoin is up by 48.38% on its monthly chart amidst a general crypto market resurgence.

Title: Jim Banks: A trade warrior after Trump’s own heart

By Philip Wegmann, Real Clear Wire May 10, 2025 Sen. Jim Banks was uncharacteristically curt. The Indiana Republican was walking to the elevator last month when a fired federal employee caught up to him on Capitol Hill. The protester, a budget analyst who had received a pink slip from the Trump administration like thousands of other government employees, demanded an answer for the ongoing mass layoffs. If he was looking for sympathy, he picked poorly. “You probably deserved it,” Sen. Banks said. “Wow. That’s great to hear,” the startled bureaucrat stuttered. “Why did I deserve it?” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! As the doors slid closed, a sly smile on his face, he replied, “Because you seem like a clown.” The opposite of Hoosier hospitality, it was closer to righteous indignation – and it prompted swift and opposing reactions: chortling from conservatives, indignation from liberals. “The left accuses me of not being empathetic,” the relatively soft-spoken Banks tells RealClearPolitics of the exchange, “but that just can’t be farther from the truth.” He watched as cuts to the federal workforce earned wall-to-wall media coverage and listened as some of his new colleagues likened reductions in the public payroll to an assault on democracy itself. He felt caught between “two different universes.” While government employees inside the Beltway are treated like a protected class, blue-collar workers from flyover country are viewed as victims of inevitable “progress,” or more often, not viewed at all, he says. The workers at shuttered factories seldom go viral, Banks notes: “There was no sympathy for them.” And that is what really bothered Banks. “I wasn’t trying to be funny, and I wasn’t looking for a viral moment,” he says. “I just have no patience for anyone who thinks they’re entitled to a government job.” The other thing that bothers Banks came to him a week later while seated in the White House Rose Garden: the ignorance, or indifference, of the politicians who signed the trade deals that he believes hollowed out the heartland. The president said the same on “Liberation Day.” “It is so true,” Banks insists. “After eight years in Washington, I’ve come to recognize that President Trump is right. That’s why I fully back the tariffs.” Hence his ongoing bet. Banks doesn’t merely believe tariffs will make middle America boom. He is convinced that if Republicans embrace the working class, if they cast their lot with the calloused rather than the credentialed class, the GOP can cement permanent majorities. This makes the 45-year-old senator a trade warrior after Trump’s own heart. And that trade war has been going pretty well for Indiana. So far. Rather than build the new Civic in Mexico as planned, Japanese automaker Honda will build the popular sedans at their Greensburg plant to skirt the 25% auto tariff. General Motors expanded its light truck production for the same reason, and now more Chevy Silverados and GMC Sierras will roll off the line in Fort Wayne. But it is more than just cars and trucks. Under the threat of tariffs, Pharma giant Eli Lilly beefed up domestic production and hurried plans for a $9 billion research and manufacturing facility in the state. Swiss drugmaker Novartis has followed suit and will expand production in Indianapolis. Banks keeps a running list of every new factory expansion and each new investment from cardboard boxes to kid bicycles in Indiana. “We have got everything going for us, the workforce and the manufacturing base, already,” he says. “We’re going to benefit more than anywhere in the country.” While Indiana already has the most manufacturing per capita of any other state, he believes they have even more to gain from tariffs. Most economists say otherwise. Because the state is so manufacturing-heavy already, it has the most to lose on both sides of the export-import ledger. Manufacturers who rely on foreign inputs such as raw steel and finished semiconductors will likely take a hit. “It’s going to raise their costs, and it’s going to lower their productivity,” predicted David Hummels, an economics professor at Purdue University. Trading partners aren’t powerless either. They know the pain points to target for retaliation (think corn, soybeans, and pork). “Indiana is easily the most trade exposed state in the union,” said Michael Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. “We are ground zero for both agriculture and manufacturing.” And while the White House touts the benefit of “strategic uncertainty” in overseas trade talks, that same uncertainty throws investors for a loop at home. “We are probably in a recession already,” said Kyle Anderson, an economics professor at the Indiana University Kelly School of Business. Firms are holding their breath and hoarding cash as negotiations continue. If those talks fall through, if the Liberation Day tariffs go live, he concluded, “we’re looking at severe contraction in the economy.” Such is the conclusion of a century of economic consensus applied to the current trade wars. But Banks scoffs at that “foolish outlook on what President Trump is doing.” The tariff schedule announced by the president in the Rose Garden isn’t the new status quo. It’s simply the starting point for negotiations. “Deals are going to happen quickly,” he predicts, “and they’re going to be really good deals for America.” Banks doesn’t have much patience for economists in air-conditioned faculty lounges anyway. Many of those same dismal scientists heralded globalism as an unmitigated good. “This is about the long-term viability of blue-collar jobs and America’s manufacturing base,” he says. “And for too long we’ve had leaders, and university economists, who turn a blind eye to what China has done to us.” That is the vibe shift. Patrons of big business for decades, Republicans once held as articles of faith that greed was good, global markets were most efficient, and Wall Street knows best. But not Jim Banks, and not the current populist president and his anti-free trade adherents who have taken to insisting that unfettered commercialism makes a poor substitute for the American Dream. Markets are made for America, they argue, not America for markets. This vision isn’t just a protectionist fever dream. The discontent is real. “We built our entire economic foundation on consumerism, providing Americans with the cheapest products,” said Larry Fink, CEO of private equity behemoth BlackRock and no friend of MAGA, during a recent CNBC interview. “Did that come at a cost that some of our communities were decimated and lost jobs? Absolutely.” His conclusion? “Maybe we went too far on the consumerism.” Workers who lived through the China shock had already reached their own conclusion decades before academics coined that term. And their answer isn’t that “maybe” globalism went too far. During his maiden speech, Banks said as much, condemning the system that allowed 6 million manufacturing jobs to go overseas while 90,000 factories shuttered. A bright spot in the Rust Belt, Indiana has survived these trends. They have not escaped them. Yes, the state has more manufacturing per capita than the rest of the union. But Banks argued on the floor that wages haven’t kept up. Yes, the state leads in domestic steel production. But he reminded his colleagues in the upper chamber that the industry has shrunk by two-thirds. Yes, Indiana and America lead in advanced manufacturing. But Banks warned that those advantages are eroded daily by Chinese competitors who build industries off the backs of slave labor, scoff at copyright laws, and reverse engineer and then steal American technology. A rite of passage in the Senate, Banks delivered his maiden speech the same day Trump announced a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs. The markets, the president said, were getting “yippie.” But Banks was unbothered. It isn’t his first trade war. “We went through this eight years ago, and I learned a lot of lessons. I didn’t always trust President Trump, and I was wrong. President Trump was right,” he says with the unwavering faith of a fervent convert. “I know where Hoosiers stand on all of it: They’re begging us to stand up to China and back President Trump’s America First trade agenda.” Banks won a House seat in 2016 and arrived in Congress, by his own admission, as “a traditional conservative Republican.” He reflexively believed in free trade back then, disagreed with Trump on fiscal and foreign policy, too, and was rather unremarkable. At least, that is, according to an Atlantic profile which described the freshman as “a fairly ordinary Republican congressman, trying to find his way in Washington in not-so-ordinary times.” That was the beginning, though. Evolution was gradual. A conscientious objector early on, Banks opposed Trump’s first trade war. Despite a veto threat, he co-sponsored legislation in 2019 that would restrict the president’s authority to levy tariffs. That’s when the phone calls started coming. One of the voices on the other line: the executives in the Nucor C-suite. They are the giants of the mini-mill, the company that makes skyscraper steel from scrap metal in Indiana. “I quickly heard from Northeast Indiana, from Nucor and other steel leaders that came and educated me on why they supported, and they wanted me to support, the tariffs,” Banks says of those conversations. Complete conversion on the tariff question came later during COVID-19 when China restricted the export of medical necessities, like medical masks and ventilators. Products that the U.S. once produced stateside were now out of reach. The pandemic “exacerbated,” the argument, Banks says. He looks at his vote to claw back presidential tariff authority as “one of my few regrets from my time in Congress.” Today, it seems like Republicans are all protectionists now. At least in public. Virginia Democrat Rep. Don Beyer has watched the transformation from across the aisle. Off the House floor – read that: away from the cameras – he reports that his GOP colleagues are spooked. They don’t like the on-again, off-again tariffs. So why won’t they object? “It’s tough to stand up to Donald Trump,” Beyer told RCP, “and expect any kind of political career.” This doesn’t explain Banks, though. His conversion isn’t recent. And yet he isn’t a conservative apostate either. Instead, Banks is of the new kind of Republicans, a Middle American radical who is rebellious only insofar as he rejects a century of economic consensus and an obsequious deference to big business. He exudes an intuitive kind of heartland conservatism. He inherited it. Banks was new in town, still just that “fairly ordinary Republican congressman” that the Atlantic once described, when he attended a private reading of a new memoir called “Hillbilly Elegy.” Killing time before the author arrived at the Library of Congress, he struck up a conversation with “the wife of some liberal Senate Republican” (perhaps a sign of the times; moderate GOP senators are an increasingly rare breed). She had brought her well-worn copy and a sense of curiosity. “I am excited to hear him speak,” she explained, “because I find these people to be just so interesting.” Banks smiled back politely, not wanting to stir up trouble. “Wait a minute,” he thought to himself as he took his seat, “these people,” the objects of zoological fascination in Washington, D.C, “are my people.” A “hillbilly” just a generation removed, he grew up in a trailer at the end of a dead-end street. His father, a union Democrat, worked on the line building axels and driveshafts at a Columbia City plant. His mother had a job as a line cook. Toys branded “Made in China” were put back on the shelf at department stores, and in their home, “NAFTA was a four-letter word.” Despite the occasional furloughs, in the 1980s when his dad picked up graveyard shifts at other factories to make ends meet, there was opportunity in Indiana. His grandfather had moved there for work, leaving a Kentucky coal mine behind. His grandmother, illiterate, often barefoot, and the stuff of family legend, scandalized their small town when they arrived. “We talk about growing up on the wrong side of the tracks,” Banks later told J.D. Vance in 2021 during a now-deleted episode of the Indiana congressman’s podcast. “And we are proud of it.” Banks can only recall two politicians who truly appealed to his family. The first was Ross Perot, the fiercely anti-free-trade third-party candidate who helped cost President George H.W. Bush reelection in 1992. The second was the man who descended a golden escalator decades later and won the presidency the year Banks was elected to Congress. His father won’t admit it, but Banks is certain his dad “was more animated when Donald Trump won than when I did.” Their inherited worldview wasn’t strictly ideological. At least at home, it was common sense. An appliance made in the USA outlasted the Chinese knock-off, and exporting an industrial base to an unfriendly communist regime had negative geopolitical externalities. “Most guys like my dad, who are wise but didn’t go to college, for them,” he says, “this is just intuitive.” It is now the basis of his ongoing mission. On a flight from Fort Wayne to Indianapolis, Banks slid a two-page memo across the cabin table. Trump was two months into a four-year exile, and Republicans were in the wilderness. After the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, some Republicans argued it was time to move on from the former president and his populist project. Argued former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the sixth-ranking House Republican, Trump was “an unrecoverable catastrophe.” But Banks called Trump’s populism, “a gift that didn’t come with a receipt.” Banks believed that Republicans could either double down on blue-collar populism or kiss their hopes of winning the popular vote goodbye. McCarthy listened as Banks listed four priorities during the 30-minute flight to guide the party for the next three years: Hammer Biden on the border, condemn Democrats for their “woke” identity politics, condemn China’s “predatory trade practices,” and create a “working families task force.” Check, check, check, and check. The GOP would follow through on each of those bullet points. The memo was the answer key to a question Banks would later ask Vance, years before he entered Ohio Republican politics: “How do we keep voters like my dad in the Republican Party?” Early returns were positive. Without Trump, Republicans barely won back the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterms. With Trump, they gained ground with every major demographic group and won back complete control of government. Questions still linger, however. “Right now, these Trump voters – the GOP is just renting them,” longtime Trump pollster John McLaughlin told RCP of the new additions to the Republican voting coalition. Speaking of the disaffected Democrats and traditionally liberal constituencies who pulled the lever for Trump, he added that the GOP needed “to make a decision if they’re going to make them permanent.” Banks has already made up his mind. “It’s a multiracial, union, across-the-board working-class voter coalition that gave President Trump his victory and gave us majorities in both the House and the Senate,” he says. “The new GOP has to stay cemented there.” Trump won’t be on the ballot during next year’s midterms or the general election after them. “How do you win?” he asks of the post-Trump era. “You win on that agenda.” The effort is ongoing; the document that Banks wrote five years ago, a mile marker. While Republicans now love the tariff and the labor union, the change represents a sudden break with the past. “Frankly, the fact that the memo that you wrote could be written by a sitting U.S. congressman and could be shared broadly in the conservative intellectual world,” Vance told Banks in 2021, “is a good sign.” It wouldn’t have been possible, and certainly wouldn’t have been taken seriously, before Trump. Added Vance, “I don’t think that would have happened five or 10 years ago.” Republicans have been soul-searching for the better part of a decade. Former Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, not unlike Banks, hit the books after losing the 2016 nomination to Trump to try and discover why the GOP base had just rejected a GOP orthodoxy. Overtures to free trade, limited government, and a muscular foreign policy fell flat when compared to whatever the billionaire celebrity was offering. The old answers couldn’t solve “American carnage.” A new right, these reform-minded conservatives have concluded, is required. But Banks struggled with the nomenclature. “I’m not big on the terminology. I like common-good capitalism,” he told Vance of the term that Rubio favored at the time. Others called the new orientation Trumpism, nationalism, populism, or national populism. “Help us out,” he asked. “What is it?” “Populism by itself is not enough,” the “Hillbilly” author replied. “You need populism along with really high-quality leaders,” he continued. “The biggest problem right now in America is not the populace, the population is not the problem,” he concluded. “The leaders are actually the problem.” Vance presented himself as the solution the next year and ran for Senate. His first endorsement from a member of Congress came from Banks. It wouldn’t be the last time. He says unequivocally that now Vice President Vance “is going to be our nominee in 2028.” More than horse trading, the men with similar backgrounds have a genuine friendship. At a Fort Wayne rally last summer, Vance paused to ask the Hoosier crowd for help finding “Jim’s Dad.” The congressman spoke “highly of his family,” he said to explain the interruption of regularly scheduled campaign programming. Vance wanted to meet before hopping back on the plane. “Let’s shake hands afterwards at least,” he said while searching through the crowd, “so I can tell Jim we met properly.” Opportunity for Banks came during the Trump exile. As chairman of the Republican Study Committee in June of 2021, he led a pilgrimage to Trump’s club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where lawmakers workshopped the messaging of the working-class party at the luxury estate. The two men didn’t know each other well. During Trump’s first term, Banks was closer to former Vice President Mike Pence. Banks met the president in the Oval Office after standing in a long line of newly elected members of Congress. A photo was customary, but the Indiana Republican had a special request. Could the vice president join the picture? Trump agreed. Behind the Resolute Desk, as the photographer focused the shot, the president asked the little Hoosier delegation who did more to help him win Indiana – Pence or Bobby Knight? Knight, the Indiana University basketball coach with a legendary bad temper, had endorsed Trump in the final days of the GOP primary. Pence, the former Indiana governor, had helped Trump win over the religious right. Without missing a beat, Banks replied, “Definitely Bobby Knight.” Looking back all these years later, he quips that there hasn’t been “a better political marriage than Bobby Knight and Donald Trump.” His relationship with the former vice president, on the other hand, is non-existent. He once predicted that “Pence will be president one day.” Now they don’t speak. Banks was just the second member of Congress to endorse Trump for president. Pence is the most prominent GOP critic of tariffs, and he calls it the “largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.” “In many ways, he’s contradicting himself this time around,” Banks says of Pence, citing the much smaller and targeted tariffs the Trump-Pence administration placed on China. He adds, “I hope that he comes back around and recognizes it. There’s still time for him to do that.” This is as unlikely as a reconciliation between the two. Banks has become more aggressive. He was harder charging during the Biden era, and his working-class memo, an overture to Trumpism, had come to the attention of the president’s eldest son, and de-facto talent scout, Donald Trump Jr. When Indiana Sen. Mike Braun announced that he would run for governor rather than a second term, the Trump family started looking for another ally. “Do you want my endorsement?” Trump asked. “Sir, of course, I want your endorsement,” Banks recalled. “I said, I can’t lose if I have it.” The support didn’t come in a vacuum. The empty Senate seat was attracting the wrong kind of attention from the Trump family’s perspective. Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels was reportedly exploring a bid. A fiscal hawk and an alum of the Bush administration, the Indiana elder statesman was a throwback to an older kind of Republicanism, decidedly skeptical of MAGA populism. “If you are going to replace Mike Braun, replace him with someone who is going to stand up for Trump and the agenda,” Banks says of that shadow competition, “not with someone who will be the next Mitt Romney.” In this way, the president was persuaded to give his endorsement, Daniels was convinced not to run, and Banks says, “a bloody and costly” primary fight was avoided. But even after Trump cleared the field for him, Banks kept going hard in the paint. At the Republican National Convention, he warned the party faithful from the mainstage that “this was no time for wimpy Republicans” before taking a seat next to Trump and Vance in the presidential box suite. It was his 45th birthday. His speech, an advertisement for a new kind of Republican. The contrast is stark even in the Indiana Senate delegation. Banks has spent his first three months in the Senate offering a full-throated defense of the tariffs and the trade war. His colleague, Indiana Sen. Todd Young, has pointed to economic consensus to argue not only that protectionism doesn’t work but that “Hoosier farmers, manufacturers, and rural communities” are often the first hurt by retaliatory tariffs. Donald Trump Jr. expected as much. On the campaign trail, just outside Shelbyville in March of 2024, the eldest Trump scion kept his pitch short. “Jim Banks will not be Todd Young,” he said, pretending to walk off stage. “That’s all you needed, right?” The crowd roared in applause at the routine, offering an imprecise plebiscite of just where exactly the energy now resides in the modern GOP. Banks isn’t as flashy as some of his new Senate colleagues, and the blowup with the fired federal employee seemed out of character for the usually measured and polite Midwesterner. Instead, he is more workmanlike in his approach to politics – Trump calls him “the strong-silent type.” But he is of a different breed compared to the Republican old guard. The Senate is also different. “The guys who were Trump’s biggest obstacles have left,” he says of the long exodus of the president’s skeptics, “and have been replaced by strong, pro-Trump, pro-America First Republicans,” before adding that now “I’ve joined that club.” And about that tariff bet: Banks remains bullish. The senator called RealClearPolitics for a second interview shortly after the 100th day of the second season of Trump. Markets remained skittish, the Dow Jones Industrial Average in particular. According to the Wall Street Journal, that index had just experienced its worst start to a presidency since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. Was he nervous? “Not at all,” the senator said. “The critics are looking at the wrong metrics,” he insisted. The right one is, instead, “the decline of China and the rise again of American manufacturing.” And Banks won’t blink. “This is a huge moment for our country. We have got to get it right. We can’t back down. President Trump won’t. He’s always told me that in private – you never back down.” It doesn’t seem that the new senator from Indiana will either.

Title: ‘Paying Far More Attention’: Rubio Turns His Gaze To America’s Backyard After Years Of Neglect From Washington
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/10/marco-rubio-latin-america-china/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T14:07:12Z
Full Content:
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has wasted no time in reshaping a decades-long foreign policy approach that’s paid “scarce attention” to America’s backyard and opened the door to China as a result. Rubio, whose interest in Latin America was a key talking point in his nomination to his role in the State Department, made a blitz of visits and diplomatic actions to various nations in the region to secure American interests early during the administration, most recently extracting Venezuelan opposition members to the U.S. from the regime’s grasp. As the Trump administration turns its attention to issues like immigration, fentanyl trafficking and curtailing Chinese influence globally, Rubio has become one of Trump’s key liaisons in the region. “Rubio is paying far more attention to our hemisphere than previous Secretary of State’s already with just the number of visits to the region,” Andres Martinez Fernandez, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Particularly under the Biden administration, very little scarce attention to our hemisphere. I think it was really a dangerously low level of engagement.” (RELATED: ‘Playing Offense In Our Backyard’: With Biden’s Eyes Elsewhere, China Slowly Breaks US’ Grip Over Latin America) US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives at Juan Santamaria International Airport near San Jose, Costa Rica on February 4, 2025. (Photo by MARK SCHIEFELBEIN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) During his visit to Panama, Rubio spoke with Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino to emphasize that China’s influence in the Panama Canal was unacceptable, saying the U.S. would be ready to respond if the status quo did not change. China has significant influence in the Panama Canal, owning two ports on either side of the critical seaway. American investment firm Blackrock had planned to buy the ports off of China for $23 billion, but the deal has since been delayed due to Chinese hesitance and Panamanian scrutiny. Additionally, China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Panama, in response to Rubio and the Trump administration’s pressure, gave U.S. warships the ability to travel “first and free” through the canal while increasing U.S. troop presence in its many military installations in the nation. “For decades, out of all the regions in the world, our own region has received the least consistent attention from U.S. policymakers,” Rubio wrote in an April 2024 column for The National Interest. “This cannot continue if we want security, prosperity, and freedom to win out in the Western Hemisphere.” Further down south from Panama, Rubio and the Trump administration have applied pressure on the socialist state of Venezuela. Rubio oversaw the rescue of five Venezuelan opposition members that were trapped in the Argentine Embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, after the government charged them with conspiring against President Nicolas Maduro. The five persons had close ties with opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who supported former presidential candidate Edmundo González in the 2024 election. The election was highly controversial due to the government’s denial of the results and the subsequent persecution of González, who fled to Spain to escape Maduro’s influence. Rubio openly called the Maduro regime “illegitimate” after the rescue, saying the dictator’s actions have “undermined Venezuela’s institutions, violated human rights, and endangered our regional security.” “I think what Secretary Rubio is doing with President Trump is placing pressure on the regime while engaging collectively in efforts to protect Americans, secure American interests and isolate the capacity of the regime to disrupt U.S. security,” Fernandez told the DCNF. “It’s a tough situation, and there’s some major challenges for us.” Rubio has also moved to solidify America’s ties with Caribbean nations and sound the alarm over Cuba’s human rights abuses. Additionally, China has reportedly set up at least four spy bases in the communist island nation, some of which are equipped with signal intelligence equipment used to intercept communications from a target location. The secretary met with the heads of state of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Prime Saint Lucia, Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis to discuss continued partnership while singling out Cuba as a target of further containment in early May. Some observers have compared Rubio’s posture in Latin America to the Monroe Doctrine, first coined during the presidency of James Monroe, which emphasized American domination of the Western Hemisphere and the exclusion of Europe from the region. Now, as America deals with a novel foe in China, Fernandez thinks the comparison is fair, but with key differences in the modern world. “If the goal is to protect and assert U.S. interests within our own hemisphere, that at the end of the day, that’s the core of the Monroe Doctrine,” Fernandez told the DCNF. Illegal immigration has become a key focal point of the administration’s diplomatic outreach in the region, such as cooperating with El Salvador to house deported criminal migrants in the maximum security CECOT prison. Rubio met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in February to solidify agreements to help stem the illegal immigration crisis. “Secretary Rubio knows first-hand the important role our region plays in the America First foreign policy agenda,” a senior State Department official told the DCNF. “He was intentional in his selection to visit many countries in our hemisphere during his first international trip.” “Whether it be working with regional allies to deter illegal immigration, designating cartels and gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organizations or holding tyrannical regimes accountable, Secretary Rubio remains focused on making America safer, stronger, and more prosperous,” the official added.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100K – So why are BTC ETF inflows suddenly slowing down?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-hits-100k-so-why-are-btc-etf-inflows-suddenly-slowing-down/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T02:00:37Z

Inflows are back but, why do they feel weaker than before? Bitcoin’s rally past the $100,000 mark has reignited excitement across the crypto landscape, with spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs riding the wave of optimism. These U.S.-listed funds, which had recently faced outflows amid tariff-related uncertainty, have swiftly rebounded, attracting significant institutional capital. In just the past two days, i.e., the 7th and the 8th of May, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a combined $260 million, reflecting renewed investor confidence. While the aggressive pace of inflows appears to be leveling off, the sustained demand signals that institutional appetite remains strong as Bitcoin continues to test new highs. However, while Bitcoin has now breached the $100K milestone, the recent ETF inflows haven’t quite matched the intensity seen during previous market recoveries. Back when BTC was still below $100K, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows surge as high as $917 million in response to tariff-related rebounds. In contrast, the most recent data from Farside Investors shows more modest figures: $142.3 million and $117.4 million in inflows on the 7th and the 8th of May, respectively. What stands out, however, is not just the volume but the evolving behavior of major institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity, suggesting a potential shift in strategic positioning. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which has consistently dominated daily inflow charts, appears to be losing some steam. After recording a staggering $643.2 million in inflows on the 23rd of April, recent figures show a sharp cooldown, with daily contributions slipping to the $30–70 million range. Analysts suggest this slowdown could reflect a recalibration of investment strategies or signal the end of BlackRock’s initial accumulation phase. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) is showing renewed strength, garnering over $75 million in inflows across just two days. This rebound could help Fidelity reclaim ground in the competitive Bitcoin ETF arena, especially after a week of net outflows. Now, while Bitcoin ETFs continue to draw investor attention, Ethereum [ETH] funds are facing a different reality. On the 8th of May, Ether ETFs recorded outflows for the third consecutive day, with $16.1 million exiting the market, all from BlackRock’s ETHA, while the remaining eight Ether funds saw no activity. Interestingly, Fidelity, though not leading the ETH ETF charge, has taken a strategic leap by advancing into new territory. Its spot Solana [SOL] ETF filing has now been formally recognized by the U.S. SEC, signaling its broader ambition in the digital asset arena. While toppling BlackRock’s dominance won’t be easy, Fidelity’s expanding footprint suggests it’s gearing up for a more aggressive presence in the evolving crypto ETF landscape.

Title: BlackRock expands quantum risk disclosure in amended Bitcoin ETF filing
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/blackrock-quantum-risk-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-05-10T01:00:34Z
Full Content:
Share this article BlackRock has updated its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) prospectus with expanded language on the potential risks posed by quantum computing, adding a detailed discussion to what was previously a brief mention of the technology. The amended prospectus, filed on May 9, includes extensive details about how quantum computing advances could compromise Bitcoin’s cryptographic security. The filing notes that advances in quantum computing technology could undermine the viability of many cryptographic algorithms used globally, including those used to secure digital assets like Bitcoin. “If quantum computing is able to advance in that way, there is a risk that quantum computing could result in the cryptography underlying the Bitcoin network becoming ineffective, which, if realized, could compromise the security of the Bitcoin network, or allow a malicious actor to compromise the wallets holding bitcoin owned by the Trust or others on the Bitcoin network, which would result in losses to Shareholders,” the filing reads. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who first reported the changes, noted that such disclosures are routine in SEC filings. “These are just basic risk disclosures. They are going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset that’s being invested in. It’s completely standard,” Seyffart said. The filing notes that while the Bitcoin community is working on quantum-resistant solutions, “there is no guarantee that new quantum-proof architectures will be built and appropriate transitions will be implemented across the network at scale in a timely manner.” BlackRock on Friday also filed an amendment to its iShares Ethereum Trust, adding provisions for in-kind creation/redemption. The filings surfaced after the firm met with SEC staff to discuss implementing staking and parameters for options trading on crypto ETFs. There has been ongoing back-and-forth discussion surrounding quantum computing and how it could pose a risk to Bitcoin’s security. Concerns spiked last December when Google unveiled Willow, its next-generation quantum chip. The company claimed Willow would solve certain computational tasks in minutes—tasks that would have taken the world’s most powerful classical supercomputer 10 septillion years. Just a few months later, Microsoft announced its own milestone: a quantum chip called Majorana 1, which it said addresses key scalability challenges that have long held the technology back. These developments have reignited fears in the crypto space about how fast quantum computing is advancing, and whether it could soon threaten the cryptographic foundations that secure Bitcoin and other digital assets. Many in the community voiced immediate concern that increasingly powerful quantum machines might one day crack the encryption protecting older Bitcoin wallets and even modern exchanges. Despite rapid progress, most experts agree that quantum computers aren’t yet powerful or stable enough to pose a real threat to Bitcoin in the short term. For now, these breakthroughs are more theoretical than practical when it comes to breaking public-key cryptography at scale. Still, the industry isn’t waiting around. Many projects are already exploring or implementing quantum-resistant technologies, anticipating the eventual arrival of a “quantum-safe” future. Interestingly, quantum computing may not just pose risks. It could also enhance blockchain security. Last month, researchers from JPMorgan, Quantinuum, and other groups successfully used a quantum computer to generate certifiably random numbers—a breakthrough that could strengthen encryption, improve digital signatures, and make future blockchain systems even more secure.

Title: Platforms, Private Credit Fund and Banks’ Fortunes Are Increasingly Intertwined

Highlights Bank exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), including private equity (PE) and private credit (PC) funds, has increased significantly. The Fed estimates that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds rose from less than $10 billion in 2013 to approximately $300 billion by the end of 2023. The financial system is becoming increasingly interwoven, connecting banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and end customers, increasing banks’ credit and liquidity risks. Private credit exists as an essential part of the capital spectrum, especially for firms that cannot get, or choose not to get, traditional bank channels. The private credit firms — including venture capital companies, buyout funds, hedge funds, direct lenders and others — are in turn significant partners for FinTech platforms that, themselves, extend loans. The capital flows that connect banks, private credit firms, FinTechs and the latter’s end customers is increasingly interwoven, with risks and rewards extending across that continuum. In a report by the Boston Fed, research shows that banks have been increasing their exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFI), a category that includes private equity (PE) and private credit (PC). The data shows that large banks’ total loan commitments to PE/PC funds are approximately $300 billion, or 14% of large banks’ total lending to NBFIs, as of the end of 2023. The tally was less than $10 billion in 2013. The central bank contends that “understanding the scale and complexity of bank-NBFI connections is important for identifying potential risks to financial stability — that is, the financial system’s ability to continue supplying capital to the economy if strained by shocks.” The PE and PC firms, in turn, put money to work in the economy. But, as the Fed report details, when these firms are hit by shocks, “they tend to draw down their bank lines of credit at a faster rate than firms with only bank credit. This creates a channel through which PC funds may increase banks’ credit and liquidity risks, on balance.” In recent months, PYMNTS has reported on the opportunities and growth industries funded by private credit. AI has been a particular area of increased investment, representing a $1.8 trillion market for funding to help build out data centers and other infrastructure. And in general, banks such as JPMorgan have been ramping up their own efforts to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, to increase private credit transactions. HSBC has reportedly been mulling making inroads into the private credit. Within FinTech, last year, for example, SumUp, a U.K. FinTech focused on POS hardware and issuing services, garnered a $1.6 billion loan provided by lenders including Goldman Sachs Asset Management, BlackRock, Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Vista Credit Partners. Earnings results have also underscored the presence of private, institutional investors on platforms, buying loans extended by those digital lenders. Upstart, in one example, has detailed in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that “out of the total principal of loans transacted on our marketplace during the three months ended March 31, 2025, 60% were purchased by institutional investors.” Personal loans originated in the most recent quarter stood at $2 billion. Earlier this week, Upstart signed a capital arrangement with Fortress, where the private credit firm is purchasing up to $1.2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform. As for the state of these arrangements, Upstart CFO Sanjay Datta said on the call that “these committed partnerships are frankly behaving exactly as designed. The basis of these partnerships was that we essentially committed to navigating the different parts of the macro cycle together … We believe we have the tools to read and react to shifts in the credit risk environment very quickly on behalf of the partners.” The securitization markets are functioning well, the executive said on the call. Upstart CEO Dave Girouard said on that same call that “we’ve had no pullbacks from our private credit … committed capital partners, and we likewise had no pullbacks from banks or credit unions … our credit continues to perform.” LendingClub, in its own earnings report, said that its structured certificates are a “preferred structure for private credit” and represented 29% of the nearly $2 billion in consumer loans originated across the platform in the first quarter. Drew LaBenne, CFO of LendingClub, told analysts on the conference call that “the opportunity is massive in the insurance market. And if you think about a lot of the transactions that we’re doing today with asset managers and private credit, a big pool of the money that they’re managing is insurance money.” The Fed paper states: “Private funds may be growing more reliant on bank loans, both by taking larger loan commitments relative to fund assets and by utilizing a higher percentage of those loan commitments.” The read across here is that the interconnectedness, and the leverage, bear watching in an environment where things are functioning well but where the clouds of macro volatility can gather at a moment’s notice.

The meeting followed another encounter on April 1 where BlackRock also discussed staking and ETP rules, but now added tokenization. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock representatives met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force on May 9 to seek guidance on a range of crypto regulatory issues, including tokenization, staking, and approval frameworks for exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to the meeting memo, BlackRock reviewed its digital asset offerings, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the proposed iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The firm used the opportunity to solicit input on how current and future products might be regulated under federal securities laws, particularly as the digital asset market matures. The meeting included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, legal, digital assets, and ETF markets. Following a prior session on April 1, BlackRock continues directly engaging with the SEC on crypto policy matters. Last month, the firm discussed technical elements of in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs and shared a detailed document on existing workflows under the current cash model. Additionally, the firm outlined how those systems might adapt to support alternative models for crypto-based funds. BlackRock also outlined its views on incorporating staking features into ETPs, aligning with other recent industry proposals reviewed by the SEC. Staking has become a central issue in ongoing discussions over whether proof-of-stake asset exposure within ETPs can be designed to meet regulatory expectations without compromising liquidity or investor protections. The meeting also addressed tokenization, with BlackRock requesting feedback on how tokenization efforts could be structured within the existing securities framework. Tokenization is the process of representing traditional assets in the blockchain as digital tokens. The firm also suggested interim standards for crypto ETP issuers, asking the SEC to consider codified guidance that might apply ahead of broader rulemaking. BlackRock additionally discussed criteria under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act that could be used to evaluate whether a crypto ETP satisfies regulatory thresholds for exchange listing. These criteria include assessments of market integrity and investor safeguards. Lastly, the meeting with the SEC Crypto Task Force covered options on crypto ETPs, with BlackRock raising technical questions about position and exercise limits. The firm requested clarity on how such limits could be structured regarding liquidity thresholds for the underlying crypto or ETP shares.

Editor Economy Alex Krainer British farmers are pushing back, but the government is preparing large-scale culling of livestock toward the end of 2025 [Originally published in I-System TrendCompass] Over the last few years I’m noticing that the grocery stores where I buy my food are less and less supplied with certain foods, particularly organic meat and periodically milk and eggs. The difference is very obvious and my Carrefour supermarket even reduced the shelf space where these foods are displayed. Certain types of meat that used to be regularly available are no longer are (at all, ever), and I can only find them from specialty butcher shops which thankfully still exist in France (although they are noticeably fewer now than they used to be). This is not an accident but, as the British farmer and activist Mark Byford (a.k.a. the Bowler Hat Farmer) lays out in this (highly recommended) interview, it is part of the global war on farming, comprising a barrage of administrative and regulatory measures designed to make farming unprofitable, incentivizing farmers not to produce food and encouraging them to sell their farms: it’s war on carbon, war on nitrogen, war on bird flu and other viruses, war on Russian fertilizers, inheritance taxes, rewilding schemes, “get out of farming” payouts and burgeoning compliance rules and bureaucracies to oversee it all. For example, Byford explained that if you grow wheat in Britain, you can earn about £160 per acre. It’s hard work and it involves considerable expense. At the same time, the government is promoting the so-called “set-aside” or rewilding schemes and will pay farmers £300-£400 per acre to let weeds grow on their land. For farmers, it’s more income, less expense and less work. Another line of attack has been directed at milk production: farmers are locked into exclusive supply contracts with corporate buyers who often fail to collect the milk. As a consequence, tens of thousands of liters a day are being simply dumped, causing farmers massive financial losses. Apparently, given the nature of their supply contracts, they have no way of recovering these losses. As a result, milk shortages appear at the same time as the farmers are forced to dump about half of their production. Egg shortage has been orchestrated under “bird flu” emergencies, justifying the culling of millions of birds. Food production is also being suffocated through regulatory measures. Active farmers are buried under the burgeoning regulatory requirements, forcing them to spend long hours filing endless forms to be compliant with burgeoning rules and regulations. Many of the new rules, including the “get out of farming payments scheme,” effectively punish or discourage food production while incentivizing the farmers to sell their farms. Farmland is then often bought by global investment behemoths like BlackRock and Vanguard. The result is that livestock is gradually disappearing and food production is shrinking, which is by now obvious to see in our supermarkets. Now there are reports that the UK government is planning a mass culling of livestock towards the end of 2025. According to Byford, similar measures are being pursued in Ireland, the EU as well as in India and many African countries with the effect that today there is 72% less food moving through global distribution chains than in the pre-pandemic period. Most probably, this is all caused by climate change or perhaps Russia, Russia, Russia, or China, China, China. However, there’s also a strange coincidence that all these measures appear to have been planned. A major policy paper, titled “Absolute Zero,” was published on 29 November 2019 as a collaboration between the leading British universities including Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and the Imperial College of London. This was all funded by the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and it laid out the strategy of reaching zero carbon emissions in accordance with the chillingly distopian UK Climate Change Act of 2008. The Absolute Zeros recommended that, “In addition to reducing our energy demand, delivering zero emissions with today’s technologies requires the phasing out of flying, shipping, lamb and beef, blast furnace steel and cement.” It’s interesting that the UK has now shut down its last blast furnace making it the only G7 nation without a steel industry. Meanwhile, as far as the corporate media are concerned, this is a “China, China, China” story, and nobody’s mentioning the “Absolute Zero” agenda. Anyhow, back to farming: the agenda is that between 2020 and 2029, the consumption of beef and lamb must drop by 50% and by 2050 it must be “phased out.” Also, all construction of new buildings must cease by 2050. “Absolute Zero” agenda (note, it was drafted well in advance of the Covid 19 pandemic), has full support and commitment of the British government, the same government that has incentivized billions of pounds to be invested in solar energy and is now planning to spray the skies to dim the sun. Of course, the genius behind Absolute Zero plans have anticipated resistance from proles and peasants of the nation, so they touched upon the behavioral measures that will be necessary: “The changes in behaviour to achieve Absolute Zero are clearly substantial. In principle, these changes could be induced through changing prices and thus providing clear incentives for behaviour to change. The alternative is that the government prohibits certain types of behaviour and regulates production processes.” Evidently, those who set the agenda understand that they must achieve their objectives against the will of the people and that the changes must “be induced.” Thankfully, the deplorable farmers and the proles have other ideas and pushback is building up along with alternative food systems, organized from the bottom up. We can expect the governments in the UK and elsewhere to try and suppress these alternatives, but having or not having food to eat is too important to capitulate to government intimidation. However, broader awareness and support for farmers will be needed in this struggle. Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Million-Dollar Careers, The Elite Seven Figures Club

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Investment Bankers discussing an important deal in a darkly lit wood panel conference room. Many people want to succeed in their careers. Some struggle, and others find ways to do well. There is a small segment of the population who were able to amass financial fortunes for their efforts. Earning an annual income of $1 million or more is a remarkable achievement. This milestone is attainable, but rare. Less than 0.5% of U.S. households earn over $1 million annually, according to the U.S. Census Bureau data and recent payroll analyses. In high-earning regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area, only about 0.54% of employees reach this threshold. Certain industries are constructed to produce high earners. A confluence of factors like economic dynamics, market demand, having the right skills and being in the right place at the right time helps. The finance sector, encompassing the stock market, hedge funds, and private equity, is a money generating powerhouse. Hedge fund managers who oversee portfolios with assets exceeding $250 million can earn between $500,000 and $3 million annually. This is how it works. Hedge fund managers traditionally are compensated under what is called a "2 and 20" fee structure. This entails a charge of a 2% annual management fee on the fund's assets under management (AUM) and a 20% performance fee on the fund's profits. As their portfolio grows, the higher the payout will be for the manager. According to Institutional Investor, Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of Citadel, earned approximately $2.6 billion in 2023, making him the third highest-earning hedge fund manager that year. The 2024 North American Private Equity Investment Professional Compensation Survey by Heidrick & Struggles indicates, private equity managing directors and partners typically earn total cash compensation including base salary plus bonus, ranging from $700,000 to $2 million, depending on fund size and performance. Private equity (PE), including firms like BlackRock, is an investment strategy in which PE acquires stakes in other privately or publicly held companies, with the goal of increasing their value and then selling them off for big profits. Investment banking Managing Directors (MDs) at bulge-bracket investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, facilitate large deals like mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs). If successful, this can earn total compensation packages that exceed $1 million per year for the MDs. This includes a base salary typically between $350,000 and $600,000, with bonuses often matching or exceeding base salaries. Real estate is another lucrative area. Top agents in luxury markets like Los Angeles earn huge commissions on multimillion-dollar properties. Luxury real estate agents in Los Angeles and similar markets, typically earn commissions ranging from 2% to 3% per transaction. For a $10 million sale, a 3% commission would be about $300,000. Agents who hustle to sell these high priced homes can hit the one million or more level. However, commission rates are often negotiated, and for high-value properties, agents may accept lower percentages. Professional sports and entertainment mint millionaires through their talent. Elite athletes in the NBA, NFL, and MLB secure contracts worth tens of millions of dollars annually. For example, LeBron James earned a salary of about $48.7 million in 2024, according to Forbes. Additionally, his total earnings, including endorsements, reached around $128 million. LeBron’s endorsement deals alone are estimated at around $80 million annually. A-list actors and entertainers mirror this. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) is a US-based labor union for film, television, video games, and commercial performers. Their rates of $2,000–$3,000 per day could potentially total millions. The real big money is in the blockbuster movies and television serieses. Well known actors stars like Dwayne Johnson can earn $20 million per film, per industry data. Influencers and media personalities, like Jim Cramer, can make millions through TV deals and sponsorships, with continuing fast growth in the influencer creator economy valued at $250 billion in 2024 per Goldman Sachs. Entrepreneurship offers a way to wealth. Founders in tech, and Silicon Valley Venture Capitalists can hit it big. Also, mom-and-pop retail, or services can scale to businesses making million-dollar profits. About 1% of U.S. small business owners, roughly 300,000, achieve this annually, per IRS data. Healthcare, especially highly specialized medicine, enables seven-figure incomes, with top neurosurgeons and cardiac surgeons often exceeding $1 million in private practice. This is driven by demand for life-saving procedures, per a 2023 physician compensation study. Corporate leadership is a significant driver, with S&P 500 CEOs earning a median of $17.9 million in 2025 (projected from Equilar’s 2023 figure of $16.3 million), while the top 100 CEOs at firms with over $1 billion in revenue reach a median of $32 million. The highest earners, like the low key profile Jim Anderson, the head of Saxonburg, Pa.-based company Coherent, which makes equipment and products for networks and laser systems, is the new highest-paid CEO in the U.S. with a total salary of $101,497,009 for 2024, according to executive intelligence company Equilar. Moon shots like Elon Musk, heading Tesla, SpaceX, the X-platform, Neuralink and other endeavors may potentially be hitting $1 billion in stock and incentive based pay or more. The tech sector is a major contributor to high earners. Typical compensation packages for senior software engineers and managers at top tech firms like Google, Meta, and Apple, ranges from $200,000 to $500,000. With stock appreciation, stock grants, bonuses and restricted stock units (RSUs), compensation where an employer grants shares of company stock, which vest over a specific period, tied to performance or time with the company, could propel the total package into the seven figure club. Some tech titans who are in a hot space, such as AI, can see $1 million and more in a strong year, often due to large equity grants, RSUs or stock windfalls. One underappreciated factor in these careers is the power of leverage. In finance, earnings scale with assets managed. $1 billion at a 2% fee nets $20 million for the firm, a chunk of which flows to the manager. Tech professionals leverage equity, where RSUs can multiply total compensation during market booms, though this ties earnings to volatile stock performance, a risk often overlooked. In real estate and entrepreneurship, leveraging loans or investor capital can amplify returns. Timing is another critical element. Finance and tech professionals thrive in bull markets, while athletes and entertainers face short peak earning windows. LeBron James’ pivot to a business empire exemplifies the need to diversify early. The path to $1 million is filled with setbacks. This includes failed startups, market crashes, athletes getting injured. Hollywood stars lose their luster or get bad investment advice can quickly make a person lose their one million plus compensation.

Title: What Trump’s Policies Mean for Latin America

US President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office have largely focused on trade and immigration policy. Latin American countries haven’t borne the brunt of these protectionist measures, and in some cases have collaborated with his administration, but that doesn’t mean that they will be immune to the fallout. MEXICO CITY – Latin America has not figured prominently in US President Donald Trump’s foreign and trade policies during his first 100 days in office, despite the appointment of a Latino – Marco Rubio – as Secretary of State. But that does not mean the region has been spared the fallout from his controversial decisions on drugs, immigration, trade, or foreign policy. More worryingly, all signs point to continued upheaval. Trump’s return to the White House has been felt more acutely in Mexico than in any other Latin American country. But many of his most extreme threats, such as mass deportations of Mexicans and other immigrants to the country, have not materialized. This is partly because far fewer people are entering the United States without papers (many of those deported under former US President Joe Biden fell into this category), and partly because finding and expelling undocumented aliens is a logistical nightmare. As a result, the dozens of shelters the Mexican government hastily prepared for deportees remain largely empty, although that could change in the future. Trump’s promised moves against the Mexican drug cartels have also gone nowhere. Trump has designated some of them as foreign terrorist organizations – thereby empowering his administration to impose economic penalties and take military action against these groups – but has stopped short of implementing such measures. While drone flights and spy-plane incursions into Mexican airspace have increased, these were already taking place under the Biden administration. As for trade, keeping track of each new tariff announcement – and its subsequent pause – for a country like Mexico, which has received “special” treatment from Trump, is undoubtedly difficult. True, Mexico was exempt from Trump’s most recent round of “reciprocal” tariffs, and the 10% baseline tariff imposed during the 90-day pause. But the country remains subject to a 25% tariff on all exports that do not comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, allegedly to combat fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration, as well as 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and auto parts. Other countries may have it worse, but Mexico is by no means insulated from Trump’s trade war. Several Central and South American countries have also experienced the whiplash of Trump’s on-off trade war. The “reciprocal” tariffs were particularly jarring for the 10 other countries – including Chile, Colombia, and Peru – that have signed free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, even if their rates were comparatively low. The cozy relationship between Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and Trump was not even enough to insulate the country, which also has an FTA with the US, from this blitz. Others, like Brazil, are suffering from the 25% tariff on steel. Moreover, the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for free trade has also dashed Argentina’s hopes of signing its own FTA with the US. More importantly, though, many Central American countries are cooperating with the administration on immigration. Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and even Nicaragua have agreed to accept non-national deportees from the US. While the most highly publicized example is the roughly 200 Venezuelans who were removed from America and sent to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador, there are many others. So far, deportation numbers have remained low, largely for the same reasons as in the case of Mexico, but could increase soon. But these partnerships are nothing new. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – the “Northern Triangle” – have long functioned as “safe third countries” for the US and will continue to do so. Our Forward Thinkers list recognizes and spotlights intellectual innovators poised to shape international debates in the years ahead. It brings together 30 influential individuals from academia, policymaking, civil society, and the private sector — voices challenging conventional wisdom and blazing a new path. Meet the Forward Thinkers Panama has fared much worse, becoming a battleground for the Sino-American rivalry. Trump wants the Panama Canal back, and no one knows how far he is willing to go to achieve this goal. An apparent Panamanian concession – the sale of two Chinese-owned ports to BlackRock – seems to have been held up by the Chinese government. The intensifying geopolitical and economic conflict between the superpowers bodes ill for the isthmic country’s future. Trump has also taken aim at Venezuela and Cuba. The administration’s initial ambivalence toward Venezuela – Trump’s team was negotiating deportation flights with President Nicolás Maduro’s regime while simultaneously ending Chevron’s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil – was quickly replaced by a campaign of “maximum pressure.” This includes a 25% tariff on countries that import Venezuelan oil and the extension of existing sanctions. Rumors are swirling that Trump’s negotiators have reached an agreement with the Venezuelan opposition, whereby – in exchange for ousting Maduro – the US would be granted unfettered access to Venezuela’s immense oil reserves. But these reports have proved hard to substantiate. In any case, Trump and Rubio are unlikely to moderate their aggressive approach, even if harsher sanctions increase the number of Venezuelans fleeing the country. The same is true for Cuba. Tightening the screws will only deepen the island’s misery, fueling the exodus of Cubans, some of whom will flee to the US. But Rubio’s Cuban-American heritage will probably prevent him from embracing a realistic strategy. Instead, the administration may strengthen the economic embargo on Cuba, further restricting travel and the flow of remittances. And if Trump imposes secondary sanctions, like those imposed on Venezuela, Cubans will only become more impoverished and desperate. Trump’s attention may be focused elsewhere, but this does not mean that Latin American countries are immune to the consequences of his decisions. The intensifying US-China conflict, the threat of a global recession triggered by the incipient trade war, and the weakening of international institutions traditionally will have far-reaching consequences for the region – even for countries that have stayed off the US president’s radar.

Title: Abu Dhabi’s IHC, BlackRock Start $1 Billion Reinsurance Firm

The yet-to-be-named firm will launch with more than $1 billion in initial equity commitments and aims to manage $10 billion in liabilities, backed by partnerships with BlackRock and Abu Dhabi-based asset manager Lunate, according to a statement. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone, ADGM, the firm will be chaired by Sultan Al Jaber — the United Arab Emirates’ minister for industry and advanced technology. It will be led by Mark Wilson, the former chief executive officer of Aviva Plc and AIA Group Ltd. BlackRock will provide an initial minority investment and will support the venture with insurance asset management, advisory services and technology. Lunate will serve as a partner, offering its experience across public and private markets. The new firm will make use of AI as a core part of the strategy, enhancing underwriting capabilities by improving the quality and speed of risk assessments. BlackRock received a commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last year, and the latest deal deepens its ties to the emirate. The firm is partnering with MGX on a partnership that aims to build $30 billion worth of data centers and other artificial intelligence infrastructure. Lunate, meanwhile, acquired a stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines from BlackRock and KKR & Co. last year. IHC, MGX, and Lunate are part of a vast empire overseen by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — the UAE’s national security adviser and a brother to its president. The UAE, of which Abu Dhabi is the capital, has been pushing to diversify away from its dependence on oil. It’s expanding into areas like technology, finance and health care. Home to three sovereign wealth funds that control close to $1.7 trillion in assets, Abu Dhabi has become a magnet for international investors. At the same time, the UAE has pushed global financial giants to set up local partnerships to help build the domestic economy.
