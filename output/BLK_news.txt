Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin, are to be “uprooted” and moved to hotels on Monday, supporters have claimed. Blackrock Supporters Group issued a media alert tonight stating the refugees will be moved to West Dublin hotels. The Irish Independent has asked the Department of Children if this report is accurate and for details. A spokesperson for the group said: “Supporters of the Blackrock Ukrainians were shocked that the Blackrock centre had been prioritised for closure. “They are vulnerable families and are in schools and jobs locally. To be moved now after two years to a remote, out of town hotel setting makes no sense. "The Ombudsman for Children has been clear that long term accommodation in hotels is damaging and inappropriate for children. “Hotels are also much more expensive than this self-catering model. Nothing about this closure makes sense.” The group has claimed the Department of Children and Integration will terminate its contract for Ukrainian refugee accommodation in Blackrock. They added that a “decision to close the state accommodation and relocate the vulnerable tenants has been unsuccessfully appealed by the impacted Ukrainian refugees, as well as the local community and representatives”. The group of 30 Ukrainians had been resident at the Blackrock property since December 2022, the group stated. They claimed the residents are “set to be moved to three different hotels and are advised that the new accommodation is temporary, and they can expect to be moved again”. The group added that it had been “highlighted in a written appeal that their lives will be put into complete turmoil if they are forced to relocate now after two years of settled life in Blackrock”. The Blackrock property has been “converted from commercial office use to emergency use, with up to 42 bedspaces and communal self-catering facilities,” the group stated, “The Ukrainians appealed as a group to the Department of Children and Integration to review the decision as their children are settled in schools and into the community,” it added. “The group learned of the closure on September 2 as schools reopened and have been supported by parents in local schools, as well as neighbours, to appeal to the Department to review the decision or delay the closure to allow them to find appropriate accommodation in the area,” the group said. Supporters and Ukrainians have joined together to now create the Blackrock Community Alliance to “help and representations have been made to the Minister for Children, Roderic O’Gorman and to local TDs and councillors,” the notification explained. A petition had been signed by 1,200 in the area and employers and schools had written letters of support. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Ukrainian families in South Dublin face relocation on Monday

Olha Sheremet’s husband Viktor has stomach cancer, meaning she must cook special food for him, she explains through a translation app while standing at the foot of a staircase in a building in Blackrock, Co Dublin. With tears streaming down her face, she moves her hand over her heart as she shows photographs of her son holding a gun while wearing a military uniform on the front line in Ukraine. She speaks to him once a month, she says. “We cannot live and cook in a hotel. Everything is nearby here, both the hospital and medical centre where my husband is being monitored. We are elderly people and it is very difficult for us to move,” the translation reads. She is one of 29 Ukrainians in a property in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock who have been told that three buses will arrive on Monday morning to move them to new accommodation. Under plans drawn up by the Department of Integration, the group which has been living at the property since December 2022, is to be split up and moved to three separate hotels near Citywest, Liffey Valley and Temple Bar. [ Ukraine’s weariness with the West grows as war enters new phase: ‘People are tired, but we have no choice’Opens in new window ] The group varies in age with eight children attending schools in the area, five of whom are in primary schools, one in secondary and two at preschool. Living there for almost two years, they have become a “big family”, they say. Half of them are working nearby, in areas such as construction, caring, pharmacy and cleaning while others are in further education or learning English to use their qualifications in Dublin. “Everyone hopes and prays that something will be organised this week so we can stay long-term. It’s very important because we worked so hard to build our lives in this area,” says Diana Tkachuk, a 31-year-old from Sverdlovsk, who lives there with her six-year-old daughter Alisa. Sitting beside her, Natalia Mishchenko shows videos she took in March 2022, of the regional intensive care hospital of Mariupol, where she worked as a nurse, reduced to rubble. The 44-year-old is working in a local petrol station while studying to work as a nurse in the Republic. Her young daughter, Varvara, attends the same school as Alisa and plays camogie locally, she says. “All our lives are organised in this area,” says Ms Tkachuk, who works locally as a florist. “It’s very sad because we have to move out and live separately. I think for some people, it will be harder without support like English, it will be hard,” she says. She does not worry for herself, she adds, but for her daughter who will have to start over again, something that was challenging when they first arrived. “Everyone is upset, stressed and shocked,” she says. Ramziia Zidliaieva, a 66-year-old economist from Crimea, who lives at the property with her son Aider said she will not be boarding the bus on Monday morning, even if it means they will officially have nowhere to stay. “I want to stay here because I like this house and I like the very nice people. It’s very good, they’re beautiful people and they’re fighting for us. I’m very happy I have these people and this family and I thank god,” she says. The employer of Ms Zidliaieva’s son in Dún Laoghaire wrote to the department urging to reconsider the move which they described as “shocking”. Blackrock Community Alliance, a group of locals advocating for the Ukrainians, also urged the department not to proceed with the move. One letter from Carysfort National School said it has worked “tirelessly” to establish a sense of security for the families. It says children living at the property had “fully settled” within the local community, adding that the “proposed disruption would impact severely on these children’s emotional state”. The residents were initially informed on September 2nd, as the children were returning to school. The department explained it is consolidating its accommodation portfolio due to a reduction in the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and seeking accommodation. [ ‘He called Ukraine his home’: frontline fighters recall Irish soldier Robert Deegan killed by Russian shellingOpens in new window ] A subsequent letter informed them of the buses due to arrive on Monday morning, adding that if they refuse the accommodation, they would not receive further offers, nor could they access the Citywest Transit Hub. “These actions are necessary to ensure the provision of accommodation for all who need it,” the letter reads. The residents wrote to the department asking it to reconsider or at least postpone the move until alternative arrangements could be made, either through private rented accommodation or host families, though no such pledges have yet been made. The majority are refusing to board the buses, hoping an agreement can be reached in the coming days. The owner of the property, who wished for their name and the precise location of the accommodation to remain anonymous, said the department declined a request for an extension to allow a planned transition to private accommodation in the area or at the current property. Applications for rent supplements in the hope of staying on as private tenants have also been declined by the Department of Social Protection as it deemed the property unsuitable for their needs. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said contracts are being ended regularly and that every effort is being made to keep those being moved, as local as possible. “The department appreciates that this is not easy for people and that moving location can be very disruptive, but at all times the department was clear that State-funded accommodation is temporary and subject to change,” he said.

Title: Terenure beat Lansdowne 28-22 in repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/06/terenure-beat-lansdowne-28-22-in-repeat-of-last-seasons-division-1a-semi-final/

Terenure’s highly rated 19-year-old Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel announced his arrival on the Energia All-Ireland League scene with a stunning cameo off the bench to help seal a 28-22 win over Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final. Terenure were leading 23-22 with 12 minutes to go when their two 19-year-old debutant halfbacks combined, Chris O’Connor moving the ball to the blindside off a back-pedalling scrum inside the home 10-metre line and Gabriel, with his second touch at AIL level, offloading outrageously to release Craig Adams. The left-winger exchanged passes with O’Connor before scoring and the win was effectively sealed when Lansdowne opted for a scrum from a penalty seven minutes out and 23-year-old prop Marcus Hanan, making his first appearance since Terenure won the AIL final two seasons ago after a neck operation, won a relieving penalty. The classy Lansdowne centre Andy Marks had scored two early tries to put Lansdowne 12-0 ahead, before Chris Cosgrave converted Adam La Grue’s try and landed two long-range penalties to put the home side 13-12 up at the break. An intercept try by Lansdowne’s debutant 19-year-old winger Todd Lawlor put them back in front but following another Cosgrave penalty Henry McErlean set up a try by lock David Maher. Cue the O’Connor-Gabriel cameo. Something also had to give at Temple Hill where the game was brought forward to 1.30pm before rain of biblical proportions arrived. By then Cork Con had eased into 20-0 interval lead through tries by ex-Sevens winger Seán French and scrumhalf Adam Maher. Matthew Bowen added a third, and James Taylor kicked the rest as they ended Young Munster’s unbeaten start with a 25-5 win. This left Clontarf alone atop 1A as they recorded a third bonus-point win away to UCD in what was a highly competitive affair until the visitors’ power game enabled them to pull away and win 30-15. City of Armagh played the sodden conditions better than Garryowen in earning a slightly surprising but deserved 13-6 win at Dooradoyle, while Ballynahinch had five tries by half-time to lead 31-7 before St Mary’s again rallied to return with two bonus points from a 36-33 defeat. Despite winning one match the newly-promoted St Mary’s sit fourth. Blackrock had a very significant 35-34 win at Ollie Campbell Park to end Old Belvedere’s unbeaten start, meaning Nenagh’s 22-22 draw against Old Wesley at nearby Energia Park leaves them as the only unbeaten side in 1B. Corinthians, Barnhall, Cashel and Instonians continue to set their rip-roaring pace in 2A. Each earned a third bonus-point win, the pick of them being Corinthians’ 63-23 win in Navan, where the talented Seán Naughton converted all nine tries, including a brace by fellow Ireland under-20 John Devine. In a reprise of last season’s women’s final Railway Union gained a measure of revenge with a 19-18 win over champions UL Bohs in a game that was moved to Annacotty as a penalty try and a try by Claire Boles sealed a 19-18 comeback win.

Title: ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) Price Targets Adjusted by Analysts; Berenberg and Deutsche Bank Maintain Buy Ratings Amid Advancements in Lithography Technology
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-holding-n-v-asml-150324232.html

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services. Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants. Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes and sells advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company focuses on making and selling lithography machines. These machines are essential for companies who want to manufacture smaller chips. The lithography machines use photolithography, a process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips that are faster and more efficient than previous models. Chipmakers require EUV lithography tools developed by ASML to continue past the 10-nanometer process node. Berenberg analyst Tammy Qiu recently lowered the price target on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock to EUR 945 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Deutsche Bank analyst Robert Sanders also recently lowered the price target on ASML to EUR 950 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Overall ASML ranks 17th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

James Docherty. Photo: willowparkjuniorschool.ie Tributes have been paid to the principal of Willow Park School, attached to Blackrock College, Dublin, following his death. James Docherty was a well respected principal at the south Dublin junior school. On the school’s website a tribute reads: “We are heartbroken to share with you the news of the unexpected passing of our beloved and devoted Principal James. Our thoughts and love are with his loving wife and cherished family. “Words cannot express grief at times like this. James was the kindest of men and tried to solve everyone’s problems. James will forever have a massive place in the heart of Willow Park. May his journey ahead bring him peace.” Mr Docherty, originally from Scotland, is survived by a young family. He had been principal of Willow Park School for almost eight-and-a-half years. He held a masters in leadership and management at Trinity College Dublin and a BA in primary school teaching from the University of Glasgow, as well as a higher national diploma in assisting multilingual learners to integrate into mainstream education. An welcome address from Mr Docherty was still on the school’s website earlier today. It read: “A Willow education provides boys with a moral compass for life. Our motto Fides et Robur (meaning faith and strength) pervades Willow daily life, as our pupils prepare for the joys and challenges ahead.” He added that new parents would “come to understand that Willow Park is more than just a school”.

Highlights this week include Tesla's (TSLA) expected unveiling of its self-driving robotaxi at a Thursday event as well as the release of earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September comes as investors monitor inflation following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut. Minutes for the September Federal Reserve meeting will also provide insight into the central bank’s recent actions, while several Fed officials are scheduled to deliver remarks throughout the week. Data on wholesale inflation, consumer credit, and the federal trade deficit are also on the calendar. Monday, Oct. 7 Tuesday, Oct. 8 Wednesday, Oct. 9 Thursday, Oct. 10 Friday, Oct. 11 Tesla is expected to introduce its self-driving “robotaxi” at a Thursday event, where the company could provide more details about several of its products. After delaying the highly anticipated event from August, Tesla will likely show off the driverless vehicle, provide details on its costs, and possibly demonstrate the ride-sharing app used to hail the vehicle that might be called a “Cybercab,” analysts said. In addition to the robotaxi, Tesla could also provide updates on its Optimus Bot humanoid robot, self-driving software, and a low-cost version of its electric vehicle (EV). Also on Thursday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices will provide updates for its artificial intelligence (AI) products as it hosts its “Advancing AI” event, where its chief executive officer, Lisa Su, will deliver remarks. Investors get a look at the performance of the financial services industry of late as several big banks will report 2024 third-quarter earnings on Friday. Leading the way is JPMorgan Chase, reporting after its prior-quarter results beat analyst expectations on strong revenue from its investment banking services. Earnings for the country’s largest bank come after an executive last month lowered expectations for net interest income following the Federal Reserve’s move to lower interest rates. Wells Fargo reported a decline in net interest income in its second-quarter report, despite its results coming in ahead of analyst projections. BlackRock will deliver earnings after it reported a record $10.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in the prior quarter. Delta Air Lines’ report on Thursday will offer insight into the air carrier’s performance during the summer travel season, while soda maker PepsiCo will deliver its financials after scaling back its growth outlook amid mixed results in its previous quarter. Market watchers will get a look at whether inflation continued to decline in September with the Thursday release of CPI. With recent data showing that price increases continue to slow, market participants are looking to see if inflation continues to trend down toward the Federal Reserve’s target. Easing price pressures prompted the Fed to reduce its key federal funds rate in September, which influences borrowing costs across the economy. Updated inflation data could send signals about the next moves for the central bank. Throughout the week, investors will have an opportunity to hear individual Fed officials’ thoughts on interest rates and the economy. Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman’s remarks on Friday will come after the inflation report, while New York Fed President John Williams, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are also on the week's speaking calendar. The Fed will also release the minutes from its Sept. 17-18 meeting on Wednesday, providing another look at how monetary officials are viewing the current economy. Markets could move on other economic data releases this week, including consumer credit on Monday, jobless claims on Thursday, consumer sentiment and wholesale inflation figures from the producer price index (PPI) report on Friday.

There was no disgrace in losing this WXV 1 clash but perhaps a pang or two of regret for Scott Bemand’s Ireland team as they produced a gutsy performance against the world number two ranked side, who extended their winning streak to six matches. The vast majority of the home side play their club rugby in the England Premiership or in France. Ireland head coach Bemand, speaking to RTÉ, said: “It shows where we are and where we’ve got to that we’re disappointed with the result. There was a bit of naivety where we copped two seven-pointers late in the first half but then we regroup and win the second half five-nil. “We’re sitting here disappointed that we didn’t execute more chances, that we didn’t execute when we got into their 22. We think we’ve left some points out there. I’m immensely proud of the girls. We came here and said we want to leave respected. “I think we’ve come some way to earning a bit more of that respect. But we quickly wanted to move through the gears and be in them games right at the death.” Canada were worthy winners on the basis that they took three try-scoring chances to Ireland’s one and might have managed more had they been a little more patient in possession. It should be acknowledged that Ireland’s spirit and fight in defence was a factor in them not conceding more points. A 15-minute spell before the interval was match-defining in terms of the outcome. Ireland lost props Linda Djougang and Niamh O’Dowd to yellow cards either side of a penalty try – it was 15 on 13 for 60 seconds at one point before Canada’s Alexandria Ellis was sent to the sin bin for a ruck offence – but did manage to briefly reduce the deficit through a penalty from outhalf Dannah O’Brien. The visitors conceded two further tries in a three-minute spell before the interval, the first from Claire Gallagher while Ireland were still a player down, and the second when a Shoshanah Seumanutafa turnover at a ruck enabled Canadian blindside flanker Julia Omokhuale to race over from 30 metres unopposed. Centre Alex Tessier, who struck the ball beautifully off the tee, landed both conversions to nudge the Canada into a 21-3 interval lead. That scoreboard dominance would have had a harsh look to it from an Irish perspective as they were arguably the better side for the majority of the first quarter but could not translate that pressure into points. Both sides elected to kick for territory early on and the visitors had particular reason to be grateful to Erin King, the Irish blindside nicking a lineout and then forcing a ruck penalty to thwart mounting Canadian pressure. Ireland also had one or two lineout issues which cost them a decent platform. Brittany Hogan made a couple of trademark bursts, while on the other side of the ball Stacey Flood’s tackle on Tessier and turnover not only snuffed out a Canadian attack but allowed O’Brien to push Ireland back into Canadian territory with a superb kick. Djougang was binned for a deliberate knock down, O’Dowd for collapsing a maul, both close to the line. Aoife Wafer provided a brief respite from the Canadian dominance with a typical charge through defenders before she linked with captain Enya Breen. O’Brien kicked the resultant penalty as Ellis was sent to the sin bin for not rolling away. Ireland needed the first score after the interval and got it thanks initially to another outstanding Wafer carry, in which she occupied five defenders. Dorothy Wall carried into contact before O’Brien’s inch-perfect crosskick was caught and dotted down by Eimear Considine. It was to be the final score of the match. Prop Andrea Stock made her Ireland debut off the bench and Deirbhile Nic a Bháird was summoned for a first Irish appearance following an ACL injury. A spiralling error-rate, with Ireland penalised for some maul transgressions, meant that neither side were able to sustain pressure for long enough to create and finish try-scoring opportunities. Nicole Fowley’s right foot earned territory for Ireland but Canada had their moments too, and it took a brilliant tackle from Emily Lane to cut down Laetitia Royer and prevent the home side from increasing their lead. Ireland will play their final game in the tournament against USA next Friday night (8.30pm Irish time). SCORING SEQUENCE – 24 mins: penalty try, 7-0; 32: O’Brien penalty, 7-3; 33: Gallagher try, Tessier con, 14-3; 36: Omokhuale try, Tessier con, 21-3. Half-time: 21-3. 45: Considine try, 21-8.

Now, as some fear Satoshi Nakamoto’s unmasking could destroy bitcoin completely, a new documentary out this coming week is claiming to have solved the biggest mystery on the internet—who created bitcoin? Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run A bronze statue depicting Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, was unveiled in ... [+] Hungary in 2021 amid a bitcoin price boom that his unmasking threatens to destroy. A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at 9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico. In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will "present a compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be" without going so far as to claim any sort of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence. Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1 million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around $66 billion at current prices. Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary, attracting 38% of punters. However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was unimpressed by the technology. "Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting," Sassaman posted, adding in a separate post that "digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's bunk." Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief executive Adam Back. However, the prediction market site is also putting an 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity not being proven in 2024. Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—when they were still posting on the BitcoinTalk forum—have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine. Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two weeks. If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

[+] in the real identify of bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto. U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business. "The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s bitcoins" is a risk factor, the company’s prospectus read. Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence, ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control. A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by "out hashing" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead

Investing.com -- This week’s U.S. inflation data for September will be keenly anticipated after Friday’s stronger than expected jobs report reassured investors who had been concerned that the economy was weakening. The Federal Reserve is to publish the minutes of its September meeting, earnings season gets underway, and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead. Thursday’s inflation data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflation. The data is likely to reassure the Fed that inflation is on a sustainable path back towards its 2% target. The Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month with a hefty 50 basis point rate cut and Friday’s jobs report argues against the central bank delivering another outsize cut in November. “Next week, CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a note on Friday. “Keep in mind that in the "dot plot" released following the September FOMC meeting, nearly half of the participants thought that total cuts of 50-75 bps by year-end would be appropriate, meaning only 0-25 bps of additional cuts this year.” The Fed is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications into how officials may be thinking about the pace of easing going forward. Additional insights into the factors that led to policymakers reaching a consensus around the 50bps cut would also be noteworthy. Investors will also get a chance to hear from several Fed officials during the coming week, including Neel Kashkari, Raphael Bostic, Adriana Kugler and Lorie Logan. Meanwhile, Thursday’s report on initial jobless claims is likely to be impacted by recent weather disruptions. U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Fed’s large rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices rose on Friday and settled with their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, although gains were limited as U.S. President Joe Biden discouraged Israel from targeting Iranian oil facilities. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. The events had oil analysts warning clients of the potential ramifications of a broader war in the Middle East. On a weekly basis, Brent crude gained over 8%, the most in a week since January 2023. WTI gained 9.1% week-over-week, the most since March 2023. Iran is a member of OPEC+ with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day or 3% of global output. The group's spare production capacity should allow other members to boost output if Iranian supplies are disrupted, limiting oil price gains. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on Wednesday and some market watchers believe it could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The central bank lowered the official cash rate for the first time in more than four years at its last meeting in August, a year ahead of its own projections, and RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said he would like to deliver two more cuts by Christmas. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Tuesday, with market watchers on the lookout for insights on its hawkish hold. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser on the docket to speak the same day. --Reuters contributed reporting

Title: Sorry, Not Sorry: Hillary Clinton Is Still Waiting for Your Apology

Hillary Clinton isn't going anywhere. Why would she? She was right. She tried to warn us. She was treated so unfairly. She deserved it; we betrayed her. We were sexist. We were duped. She was robbed. Putin, Comey, Facebook, Electoral College. The goddamned voters, man. Sorry? She's not sorry. She's still waiting for an apology from you. From all of us. If you're normal, you probably had no idea Hillary was on tour again after writing an angsty post-career memoir, her second in the category. Nevertheless, she persists. It's called Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty. Naturally, it was written in collaboration with the Evergreen Strategy Group, a woke consulting firm founded by former Clinton aides that helps clients such as Nike and BlackRock "live their values with confidence and compassion." We all know what Hillary lost. For crying out loud, she hosted a "victory" party under a giant glass ceiling on Election Night in 2016. Her campaign ordered a bunch of confetti cannons to blast symbolic shards into the air. She made her goon John Podesta go out and tell everyone to go home after she lost. "We're still counting votes," he sobbed. That was eight years ago. So, what has she gained since then? Ever the politician—ever the Clinton—she knows what she's supposed to say, so that's what she says. Even if it isn't true. Which it's not. Hillary, who turns 77 later this month, would like us to believe she's gained wisdom, perspective, acceptance, humility, all that shit. She's excited about getting older, ready to "fearlessly embrace" physical decline. Could it be that she's lying? That would be more in line with her character. It would also explain why the Annie Leibovitz cover photo is touched up beyond all recognition. All this time after venting her postelection feelings in What Happened, Hillary is determined to prove she's not done venting her feelings. She is Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite, still harping on about the high school state championship she would have won if coach had put her in the game in the fourth quarter. About the country she alone could have saved. She "flew on Air Force One, dined with kings and queens, and was constantly surrounded by armed guards." She coulda been a contender. As if anyone cares, which they don't, Hillary lauds herself as "the first woman to win a presidential primary, the nomination of a major party, and the national popular vote." Hell, even her MSNBC fans must be getting tired of her by now. (The ones who haven't died yet.) "These days, I find myself thinking mostly about the future," Hillary bluffs as she relitigates old grievances. "Time and so many battles won and lost have given me a thicker skin and a stiffer spine." How she really feels is revealed in the text. Her "pang of vindication" when Trump was convicted of paying hush money to a porn star. "A fraud was committed against the American people, against all of us," she bristles. "I would have won. ... Even now, just thinking about that moment makes fury well up in my chest." She's owed an apology, dammit, even if we don't deserve her forgiveness just yet. It's probably made up, but Hillary claims to have been approached by a groveling FBI dude eager to apologize for the bureau's "devastating and unfair" investigation (her words) into her emails. She was not in the mood. "I stared at him for a minute, trying to contain my anger," she fumes. "You're sorry? Now? Finally, I said, 'I would have been a great president,' and walked away." These little nuggets are like porn but for the sick freaks who bought Robert Mueller prayer candles and waited in line to take selfies with Elizabeth Warren. Your weird aunt who went a little too far with the "Anthony Fauci, sex god" stuff. Bless her heart, Hillary. At one point, she likens herself to Cassandra, a virgin princess from Greek mythology described as having "bulky breasts, small feet" and a "shortish, round-faced, white, mannish figure." Cassandra could see the future, but was cursed to be ignored. By the Trojans, for example, who dismissed her warnings about Greek invaders hiding in a wooden horse. "I take no pleasure in being right. In fact, I hate it," Hillary seethes. "I tried to raise the alarm [about Trump] in every way I could, but the media and many in the political establishment dismissed me as overwrought, even hysterical." Because the Trojans didn't listen, Cassandra was captured and forced into sex slavery. Because the voters didn't listen to Hillary, a similar fate befell America. It's about to happen again, so don't say she didn't warn you. In the chapter "Remaining Awake Through a Coup," Hillary unveils her deranged fantasy of a second Trump term. She envisions "soldiers patrolling streets" alongside "roving deportation squads." Immigrants rounded up in "massive, sweltering camps." Trump has declared war on Mexico. Putin has conquered Ukraine. Smog blankets the sky. Crops rot in the fields. Trump's enemies rot in prison alongside the women and doctors who ran afoul of his pregnancy monitors. Dumpsters overflow with unwanted babies. "I wish the imagined future I've sketched out were just a liberal fever dream, some kind of dystopian MSNBC fan fiction," Hillary bemoans. "But it's not." (It is. Overwrought, even hysterical, one could say.) This coming from the same failed politician who wants us to "work together to restitch our unraveling social fabric and to rebuild Americans' trust in one another." Uniquely ill-suited to the task, she is. Completely oblivious, as well, when preaching against "viewing the other party as traitors, criminals, or otherwise illegitimate," having done precisely that throughout the book. "Soon enough, actual blood gets spilled." (Um, it already has.) Bullshit aside, Hillary relays a cute anecdote about "an editor at a major newspaper" who reached out in 2022 to ask if she'd write an op-ed about "how prescient" she was to denounce Trump supporters as "deplorables." The media can be so unfair. When she's not moping about being right, Hillary tries to convince us she doesn't spend all her time obsessing about politics. That she's fun! You can imagine how persuasive this is. Several chapters recount good times hanging out with old friends who know her as "Big Girl," and her "postmenopausal belly" as "Beulah." (Don't ask.) The girls weekend at the Franklin D. Roosevelt library watching "a film on the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II" sounds like a hoot. Ditto the "fun" story about the time her long-suffering bag servant Huma Abedin struggled to open the "fancy rhinestone-cheetah clasp" on her purse. Even a nice memory about shampooing her hair in the lake with childhood friends is instantly ruined. "I shudder now to think of the environmental implications," she moans. Hillary says her editorial consultant wanted the book to "feel like sitting with me at a dinner party." (Like hell, apparently.) Considering the intestinal fortitude required to make it to the end, I'd say mission accomplished.

Last week closed on a positive note, with two key developments easing concerns about the economy. A strong jobs report helped calm fears of a weakening labor market, while the resolution of the dockworkers’ strike alleviated worries about supply chain disruptions. In addition, oil prices, which had surged early in the week due to Middle East tensions, saw a welcome pullback by the weekend. This week promises to be action-packed, with plenty on the horizon. With this wave of optimism, let’s dive into what the coming week has in store. NVIDIA’s AI Summit kicks off Monday, running from Oct. 7-9 in Washington, D.C. The three-day event will bring together industry leaders to explore how AI can tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. With a focus on healthcare, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and more, the summit will highlight AI’s potential to drive innovation across key sectors. Amazon’s (AMZN) highly anticipated two-day Prime Day sale event kicks off Tuesday, offering a valuable glimpse into consumer behavior and e-commerce trends. The sale will provide key insights into what products shoppers are prioritizing, as well as into the broader state of consumer demand. This event is expected to highlight popular categories and pricing strategies and could serve as a bellwether for the coming holiday shopping season. Amazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. The company’s Prime Day event earlier this year generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will finally unveil the highly anticipated Robotaxi on Thursday at Warner Bros. Studios (WBD) in Los Angeles, California. Dubbed “We, Robot,” the event will show the first look at the prototype and the booking platform for owners and riders. There will be also an update to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which powers the robotaxis, along with a production timeline and the service launch date. PepsiCo (PEP) is set to report its earnings ahead of the closing bell Tuesday. Then, Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL), Infosys (INFY), and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) are scheduled to release their earnings before the market opens. The week will close with major banks taking center stage Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), and the BNY Mellon (BK) lead off the quarterly earnings season for the financial sector. The Consumer Credit report for September is set to be released Monday. Midweek (on Wednesday), investors will keep an eye on the Wholesale Inventories data for August, along with the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September FOMC meeting, which could provide insights into the central bank’s next moves. Thursday will bring a trio of key data releases, including initial jobless claims, the consumer price index (CPI), and core CPI, offering a detailed look at inflation and labor market trends. Finally, on Friday, the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI will be released alongside preliminary consumer sentiment data for October, rounding out the week with a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures and consumer outlooks. – Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Western North Carolina has world’s richest lithium, purest quartz deposits: Is Hurricane Helene a land grab by DOD to steal these valuable resources?

Some analysts say there was unusual atmospheric activity during Helene's track that appears to have produced such a high voltage that something was able to "push" it towards the areas that got hit the hardest. The reason could have to do with all those valuable minerals. "We have the richest deposit of lithium in North Carolina," reported 100percentfedup.com. "We have a top producer of lithium, Albemarle, getting a $90 million contract from the Department of Defense to create a lithium mine. Guess who has 12 million shares of Albemarle? BlackRock." Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests. Albemarle, by the way, received a $90 million grant from the DOD to advance its domestic mining operations â operations that locals throughout western North Carolina do not want in their now-destroyed backyards. "Something doesn't smell right," 100percentfedup.com noted. "Are we seeing a similar tactic that was used in Hawaii for a land grab? Lahaina, Maui 2.0?" ?? Was Hurricane Heleneâs Path & Behavior a Result of Natural Processes or was It Manipulated? Dane Wigington Discusses #HAARP #CloudSeeding #WeatherWarfare #GeoEngineering #SAI pic.twitter.com/DLWIX3G9P2 â B?eth Kay ? (@PoisonDeathShot) September 30, 2024 (Related: Much of western North Carolina is now isolated from the rest of the world due to blocked and destroyed roads and damaged energy infrastructure.) High-purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine shut down indefinitely Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina â and specifically in Spruce Pine â is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables. According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area. All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were "unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges." "Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible," the company said. Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene. It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams. "October surprise," one person wrote about the devastation. "More to come, I'm sure," responded another. The powers that be (TPTB) have apparently amassed so much power that they no longer care if the public knows about their greedy scamming operations designed to steal land and resources away from We the People.

High-purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine shut down indefinitely Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina â and specifically in Spruce Pine â is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables. According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area. All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were "unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges." "Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible," the company said. Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene. It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams. "October surprise," one person wrote about the devastation. "More to come, I'm sure," responded another. The powers that be (TPTB) have apparently amassed so much power that they no longer care if the public knows about their greedy scamming operations designed to steal land and resources away from We the People.

Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Health Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other buzzing AI health stocks. The economic impact of AI is projected to be substantial, particularly in regions like China and North America, which are expected to see GDP boosts of 26% and 14.5%, respectively, by 2030, amounting to $10.7 trillion combined. This surge is mirrored in the healthcare sector, where AI is driving transformative growth. According to SNS Insider, the Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Market, valued at USD 22.5 billion in 2023, is forecasted to reach a staggering USD 370.14 billion by 2032, expanding at an impressive CAGR of 36.5% from 2024 to 2032. This explosive growth underscores the growing role of AI in revolutionizing healthcare through innovations in diagnostics, treatment, and operational efficiency. The World Economic Forum also points out that AI's potential in healthcare is particularly promising, given the global shortage of healthcare professionals, projected to reach 10 million by 2030. AI can alleviate the strain by automating routine tasks, reducing physicians' administrative workloads, and enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This has sparked strong investment from both public and private sectors globally, making AI a key technology in the future of healthcare finance.

AI's integration into healthcare is set to not only drive efficiency but also improve patient outcomes through more precise diagnostics and personalized treatment. Companies have responded by heavily investing in AI R&D, and mergers and acquisitions have accelerated the pace of innovation. As healthcare increasingly embraces AI, experts emphasize the potential for even greater transformations. According to Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI research, "AI will fundamentally shift the healthcare landscape, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing patient care while reducing costs."

An operating room with a doctor monitoring a patient's vital signs during surgery with a medical device. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) makes and sells healthcare products. The firm has embraced AI in diagnostics, particularly in its Alinity and FreeStyle Libre systems. The company uses AI to improve the accuracy of its continuous glucose monitoring systems and to enhance its diagnostics platforms. These AI-driven tools help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. In terms of financial performance, Abbott reported $43.1 billion in revenue for 2023, up 7% from $40.3 billion in 2022. The growth was primarily driven by increased demand for its AI-powered diagnostics tools, particularly in the diabetes care segment, where the FreeStyle Libre system saw a 12% increase in sales. Abbott's continuous investment in AI is expected to contribute to sustained revenue growth as demand for accurate diagnostics rises. Overall ABT ranks 4th on our list of the buzzing AI health stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Benetton the fashionable standard bearers of Italy’s rugby renaissance
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/05/benetton-the-fashionable-standard-bearers-of-italys-rugby-renaissance/
Time Published: 2024-10-05T05:00:00Z

Whisper it quietly, but Italian rugby genuinely appears to be on the up. Last season the Azzurri had its best Six Nations in terms of results, with two wins and a draw, and although their Under-20s were patchy, they won two Six Nations matches for the third campaign in a row, including a first ever win over their French counterparts. As usual Benetton were bulk suppliers to both, yet also had their best season since joining the Celtic League in 2010. Only twice in the ensuing 14 seasons have Benetton won more matches than they’ve lost, firstly in 2017-18 and again in 2018-19 when reaching the playoffs for the first time before losing 15-13 against Munster in Thomond Park. But by any metric, their achievement in finishing seventh in the URC last season was better, not only because they won a higher percentage of matches, 11 out of 18, with one draw, but because since the expansion to include the four South African Super Rugby powerhouses this is just a more competitive competition than in its previous iterations. What’s more, in securing automatic qualification on merit for this season’s Champions Cup, Benetton reached the quarter-finals of the URC and were pushing hard to force their quarter-final against the Bulls into extra-time before going down 30-23. There were also five more wins in their run to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup. “Yeah, for sure, it was a very good season,” agrees Antonio Pavanello, who was a back five forward for a decade with Benetton and has been their general manager since 2015. “We achieved the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup away to Gloucester, but unfortunately we didn’t play well. We were, perhaps, a little too nervous and that was a shame, but we also finished seventh in the URC and we achieved the quarter-finals, and in a stronger competition than the past. “So this quarter-final was at another level compared to 2019 and honestly we played a very good match. Everybody said we would be beaten well by the Bulls so we entered onto the field without stress and it was an opportunity to play good rugby.” Interestingly, while they scored five less tries last season compared to the season before (51 as against 56), Benetton were way more resolute defensively, conceding 18 fewer tries with 56 compared to 74 two seasons ago. “Calum MacRae, our defence coach, has done a very good job,” says Pavanello of the former Scottish Sevens player and head coach, who joined two seasons ago after five seasons as defence coach at Edinburgh. “So that is the result of the focus on that area. “He has done a very, very good job and on the other side we really improved in terms of physicality and so the improvement in that area is a result of the defence and winning more collisions. That was the main area we worked on and it was important to achieve those results.” Benetton also supplied 19 players to the Azzurri in last season’s Six Nations, and even if this obliges them to invest in imported talent to offset this drain Pavanello maintains: “If we help Italy to win matches in the Six Nations we are proud to have done our job well.” With acquisitions such as Malakai Fekitoa from Munster to further swell their non-Italian contingent, it seems that Benetton now have the financial resources and independence to target a high URC finish like never before, although Pavanello says this is also due to changing perceptions. “Our (financial) balance is getting better and better, and we can spend a little bit more money, but for me what we have now compared to previous seasons is credibility. “So, when I try to get new players, it is a little bit easier because in the past they see an Italian club without too many results so even if you offered them good money, they go to other clubs. “Now, it is a little bit different. We have more credibility and players are attracted to coming here, so if you offer the same money they prefer to come to a good environment, in a good city and a good country, and with a club that is looking to achieve new goals.” But for Pavanello, the sea change he has witnessed is as much off the pitch as on it. “When I finished my (playing) career here, there were seven people on the staff, now there are 25, so we can give to the players more and more detail. The facilities are much better than in the past. I can see a club that is on the same level as other clubs around Europe. So, Benetton aren’t of a mind to leave last season as a one-off, although there are half a dozen teams who missed out on the top eight last season and are genuinely targeting the playoffs this season. “Our ambition is to repeat the URC playoffs but we know that it will be harder because first of all everybody is waiting for us and we will be back in the Champions Cup and we know that competition is really, really hard,” admits Pavanello ahead of Benetton facing Clermont (away), Bath (home), Bristol (away) and La Rochelle (home). “In the meantime to have 20 players with Italy and five with Argentina, which is not easy to manage. The Italian players have the November internationals and the Six Nations, and as well as the Rugby Championship the Argentinian players have November internationals, and that is the main issue this season.” “But I am confident that the staff will find the right turnover in a large squad and we’ll have the opportunity to keep the energy at the right time with individuals players. “If I watch the model to copy it is the Irish system and especially Leinster. I always watch their model and try to apply the same things to our system in our club and for that reason we improve a lot in the last few seasons. “I think that Irish rugby is a good environment. The Irish team is very strong and Leinster is one of the best clubs in the world.” Unlike Leinster, of course, there is no schools rugby in Italy. Benetton do not have conveyor belts like Blackrock and St Michael’s. But Treviso is one of the small hotbeds of rugby in Italy. “Consider that around Treviso there are 17 clubs. We don’t have schools where you have the chance to play rugby, the private clubs do that, and we have 17 in this area. So, in terms of the identity of rugby (in Italy) this is the most important area. “We are talking about a province of one million people and in Treviso there are 800,000 so to have 17 rugby clubs around here is very important.” Benetton have an under-18 academy managed by the FIR which works with the best players in their region, and also an under-22 academy managed by the FIR. Ultimately though, however huge Gaelic football and hurling are in Ireland, rugby still commands attention and eyes, whereas Italian rugby is dwarfed by calcio and according to the former Zebre coach Michael Bradley, languishes in 16th place in participation numbers. Pavanello admits football’s dominance commercial “is a big problem for our sport in Italy”. “We try to work a lot in communication, especially on social media and we continue to work hard because we believe we can improve year by year.” Still, you can’t help but think that rugby globally could do more, be it have a World Cup in Italy or a Champions Cup final there. “That would be a good starting point to change the view in Italy but also in other countries. For example, in 2031 the World Cup will be in the USA. That is a good chance to develop rugby there, but I hope also that in the future we will have the chance to host a World Cup. “We have more than 60 million population here and if rugby can improve in one country that is Italy and you don’t do that only with the Six Nations. As you say, you have the chance to do this with events like the Champions Cup final or a URC final, as well as a Rugby World Cup final. That is the direction rugby should take.” Ultimately though, Pavanello remains optimistic about the future of rugby in Benetton and in Italy generally. “We know that we will have one season that you can have three steps forward and maybe one season that you can do only one step forward because of the opportunities we have financially. Inside the URC and the Six Nations we are not the most important club or union but I am optimistic because I see that the pathway is right.” Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Honest First 3 things to know this morning: 1. Stock futures rise on strong September jobs report2. Port union, U.S. Maritime Alliance reach tentative deal on wages3. Crude and Brent rose more than 9% each this week aloneWatch the live show here: https://t.co/tP0OT3stKc pic.twitter.com/DNWfd8h8ke Hold on I need to check X real quick... pic.twitter.com/ZC8cc7bY2L The yen is on pace for its worst day in 20 months after Japan’s new prime minister jolted currency markets by saying the economy isn’t ready for another rate hike https://t.co/bLXCDvus9P 글로벌 '매크로' 수익률이 세계 꼴찌 '한국 증시'의 추세 추종 수익률 보다 당연히 더 높습니다. ★'윤석열'★ 귀에 경을 읽는 시간이 돌아왔습니다. 장·단기 '커브전략'에서 금리·환율의 상관관계에 관한 '기본'공식은 명목금리(실질금리 + 예상 인플레이션율 ↑) - 예상(원자재 ↑ 가격 추이) 인플레이션율 = 실질금리, OO(유가, 비트코인, 금 등 대체 투자 상품) ↑ 금리 ↑ OO ↓ 입니다. Average Hourly Earnings in the US increased 4% over the last year, well above expectations for a 3.7% increase. The CPI Inflation Rate will likely fall to 2.3% in September, meaning a 1.7% positive spread of wage growth over price increases, the highest we've seen in years. pic.twitter.com/vqYMEPy6ia Elon Musk says he will attend Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania https://t.co/kWSaLwtd8n The yen posted its worst day since June 2022 after PM Shigeru Ishiba said the economy isn’t ready for another rate hike https://t.co/lkjprA3BYD 제가 쓰려고 길게 말해야 할 것을 '요약'해서 정리한 공식이라 용어가 어렵다면, 가장 쉬운 표현으로 "물가에 어떤 영향을 미칠까?"를 ★정치권, 선거판, 지정학★과 연관지어서 시나리오를 나눠보는 것입니다. 예제 1. "중동 긴장이 고조됐다."면 어디에 넣어보면 '될까요?' 원자재에 넣으면 되겠죠. 글로벌 경제는 '어떻게 될까'요? 실질금리는 어떻게 나올가요? 예상 '인플레이션율'에 넣으면 나옵니다. The U.S. economy added far more jobs than expected in September, pointing to a vital employment picture as the unemployment rate edged lower, the Labor Department reported Friday.Read more: https://t.co/aB0zMxAtfB pic.twitter.com/1b6L2xK7s3 Japanese stocks will likely rally after the yen suffered its biggest drop in more than two years on Shigeru Ishiba’s comment that the economy isn’t ready for another interest-rate hike https://t.co/po2FwbVx4x US job growth last month topped all estimates with the largest advance since March and the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined, quelling concerns of a marked deterioration in the labor market. https://t.co/LhZxdynf4O 예제 2. 78세의 역대 최고로 늙은 미국 대선후보 '도널드 트럼프' 핵심 관계자(측근) 이스라엘 '네타냐후'가 "레바논 공격을 '확대'했다."면 어디에 넣으면 될까요? '원자재'에 넣으면 되겠죠. 실질금리는 어떻게 나올까요? 예상 '인플레이션율'에 넣으면 나옵니다. 증권가·금융언론들의 어렵고 복잡한 경제 용어 대신 직관적이라 1초 컷이죠. Surprisingly strong hiring in September has taken pressure off the Federal Reserve by reducing worries over the US labor market https://t.co/ws9Nppglno US job growth blew past every estimate in September. But a good chunk of the surge may reflect how the government adjusts the numbers. https://t.co/4rFTAOFAV1 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee lauded the strong September jobs report but warned of putting too much stock in one month’s data, adding that there are risks that inflation might undershoot the central bank’s 2% target. https://t.co/Cc4UR7oOnK "야, 이거 왜 알아야 하니?" 정치권, 선거판, 지정학을 '살펴보면' 요즘처럼 유가가 상방이라는 확신이 설 수 있죠. 그러면 리스크 온(risk on)으로 '선물옵션' 걸면 '재미'를 볼 수 있습니다. 자, 그럼 주식, 부동산 이전에 뭐 부터 공부해야 할까요? 네, 그렇습니다. 바로 '채권'입니다. 채권을 알려면 뭘 열심히 공부해야죠? 네, 그렇습니다. '매크로'입니다. "야, 주식 수익률이 채권 수익률 보다 높다는데?" 어떤 사짜가 약파는 소리를 하죠? JPMorgan and Bank of America are now forecasting a quarter-point reduction in rates when the Fed next meets in November, giving up on their calls for a larger cut https://t.co/Yc8u9Tvl4M The Fed is likely to downsize its rate cuts to 25 basis points at both the November and December policy meetings, according to Nomura https://t.co/txJMfMCjx5 Competition is heating up for government bond traders with experience who can navigate volatile markets as the BOJ seeks to further raise rates, and Mizuho is looking internally for former dealers who can return to the trading floor https://t.co/7igZknF2dj 원유·'원자재' 선물 트레이딩만 해도 주식 수익률 보다 아득히 높습니다. 예제 3. 농업보다 연봉이 높으니까 미국 GDP의 70%(약 2/3)를 차지하는 소비 여력이 높아지니 장·단기 금리 '대장지표'라 불리는 '비농업' 고용지수가 "컨센서스를 '대폭 상회'하며 '급증'을 했다."면 어디에 대입하면 될까요? 예상 인플레이션율에 넣으면 나오죠. 실질금리가 상방이면 뭐가 상방일까요? Traders are paring bets for a BOJ rate cut in December after the PM's remarks https://t.co/vPMeqBmVqA The Bank of Japan will keep seeking the best timing to raise interest rates again as economic conditions continue to improve, according to former BOJ board member https://t.co/fckXSzTDNz A surge in hiring offers Vice President Kamala Harris a fresh defense in her fight with Donald Trump over the economy, as the pair jockey to frame their visions in the home stretch of the campaign. https://t.co/8gDrGujeaU 네, '그렇습니다'. '달러'입니다. 다시, '미국'이 '고용을 아무리 '늘려도' 경기침체가 올까요? 안 올까요? 그럼 뭐가 또 문제가 되죠? '인플레이션'율이죠. 그래서 '윤석열'한테 "미국 경제 망했다"면서 노동자로 '시비' 붙지 말라고 한 것입니다. 왜? 인플레이션이 '다시 튀면' 금리 올리거나 higher for longer인데 그 피해는 누가 볼까요? 특히 환율에 취약한 '한국'입니다. US stocks closed solidly higher on Friday, as a stronger-than-expected jobs report reassured investors who had worried the economy may be slowing too rapidly https://t.co/kQojjcrpX6 pic.twitter.com/aVCFowKL5g Maps show voter registration options and deadlines for 2024 election https://t.co/rsthGo5Liu Israel may not be able to take down Iran's nuclear sites on its own https://t.co/2jUu1Z1CPt "야, 채권 수익률이 오르면 '매도'아니냐?" 예제 4. 외우지 좀 말고, 고용이 증가하면 뭐가 늘어나죠? 소비가 늘어나죠. "고용이 '깜짝' 증가를 했다."면 어디에 넣어보면 될까요? 인플레이션율이죠. '미 국채' 채권 금리(채권 수익률)는 '어떻게 될까'요? "그거 알아서 뭐 하는데?" 돈이니까. 1억 원을 투자하면 '1bp' = 0.01%당 60만 원의 손익을 볼 수 있습니다. 순식간에 통장에 몇억 원이 꽂히거나 삭제가 될 정도라 리스크 온(risk on)에 확신이 서야만 합니다. It was so much worse than you remember pic.twitter.com/lEOrfzQ8QE This, from Jack Smith's filing explaining why Trump's alleged criminal conduct in attempting to overturn the 2020 election is not immunized from prosecution, perfectly captures what Trump did. pic.twitter.com/xRN7T8hmAw Former President Donald Trump "resorted to crimes" to attempt to stay in office after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, federal prosecutors allege in a newly unsealed court filing released Wednesday.In the filing submitted by special counsel Jack Smith,… pic.twitter.com/lr2ut8tFn2 예제 5. 요즘 제가 계속 말했던 게 'LNG 가스'죠. 왜? 특히 유럽이 '러시아' 의존도가 높은데 곧 겨울철이라 소비가 늘어날 것입니다. 그럼 LNG 가격이 오를까요? 내릴까요? 가스를 못 쓰면 뭘 써야죠? 산에가서 장작을 패올까요? 연탄이라도 태울려고? 유럽인들이 '그럴 리가' 없죠. '전기' 쓸 겁니다. 그런데 ★"미국 LNG '재고량'이 예상보다 '적다'"★면 미국인들이라고 산에가서 장작을 패올까요? 연탄을 태울까요? 그럼 어디에 넣으면 되죠? 인플레이션율입니다. The US Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity should not prevent Donald Trump from standing trial for his “private crimes” in trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to US prosecutors’ newly unsealed filing https://t.co/5pnGCvDriR pic.twitter.com/BuZbNliLk4 Trump fired his attorneys after the 2020 election and replaced them with Rudy Giuliani because he would be willing to “spread knowingly false claims of election fraud,” Special Counsel Jack Smith alleged in a wide-ranging filing.https://t.co/o9kJADnABe pic.twitter.com/Hbn152QMGc After losing the 2020 election Donald Trump told his family: “It doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.”While rioters on January 6th threatened Vice President Pence at the Capitol, Trump said “so what?”165-pages of damning evidence. https://t.co/59DW36qYQ8 예제 6. "'펜딩 주택'(Pending Home Sales) 잠정 판매량이 역대 최저 수준을 벗어나지 못하고 있다."면 무슨 생각이 들죠? 주거비 생각 안 나나요? '주거비'는 CPI의 35%(1/3)를 차지합니다. 예제 7. "허리케인 '영향'으로 실업수당 청구 건수가 '증가'했다."면? 8월부터 12월까지 '허리케인' 시즌이 미국 정치권과 선거판에 어떤 영향을 줄 건지 좀 봐야죠. A judge sentenced Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk, to nine years behind bars for leading a voting system data-breach scheme inspired by the rampant false claims that fraud altered the 2020 presidential outcome. https://t.co/wDdNvrtulj Donald Trump is publicly praising Georgia Governor Brian Kemp after years of blaming him for his 2020 election loss https://t.co/Hzrjoxdt7m On January 6, Donald Trump incited an attack on our nation’s democracy because he didn’t like the outcome of the election. Armed with weapons and animated by Trump’s lies, insurrectionists invaded the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn a lawful election.The January… pic.twitter.com/hrqD3ptm7k 이제 왜 '윤석열' 일당들이 '엉터리' 경제 이론으로 "미국 경제가 망했다."는 '샴의 법칙'이 안 맞는지 설명이 될 것입니다. '샴의 법칙'은 최근 3개월 실업률 이동평균이 직전 1년 실업률의 3개월 이동평균 최저점보다 0.5%p높으면 경기침체가 시작된다는 법칙입니다. A judge ripped into a former Colorado county clerk for her crimes and lies before sentencing her Thursday to nine years behind bars for a data-breach scheme spawned from the rampant false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.https://t.co/x3XJwoMHOT 'With All Due Respect, He Is Lying': Abby Phillip Clashes with Republican Over Bogus Trump Claim https://t.co/8tsJFzjEbf In the wake of Hurricane Helene, we are seeing the best of America. Neighbors are taking care of each other. People are delivering supplies to folks in need.Thank you to everyone who has risen to this moment and stepped in to help. We will rebuild and recover together. pic.twitter.com/CA2TmRaqft '한국' 따위야 망하거나 말거나 '달러 찍어'서 민간·공무원 고용 늘리면 되는데? 기축통화국이 불만이면 달러 대신 '위안화 투자' 하던가? 인플레이션이 소비에 영향을 줄 것 같으면 금리인상하면 그만이고, 그냥 higher for longer로 바짝 말려도 그만이죠. 왜? 미국 GDP 70%(2/3)가 소비인데 달러-원 환율이 오르면 '한국'에서 수입 비용이 감소합니다. 이거 없는 얘기냐? 아닌데? '중국'에 '나왔던 얘기'죠. Kamala Harris is visiting Michigan, seeking to shore up support from traditional pillars of the Democratic base - including union workers, firefighters, and Arab American voters https://t.co/CPGiDRp7cq Two building crises — a massive hurricane cleanup and an intensifying conflict in the Middle East — could yet reshape the presidential race just weeks before Election Day https://t.co/YzNrcI4sle As president, I will fight for every American—no matter how they vote. Don’t miss my rally in Flint, MI. Watch now. https://t.co/eqzNORVftj 지정학(지리경제학) 얘기 안 하려다, 전쟁 왜 할까요? "야, 심심하니 전쟁하자." 뭐 이러나요? 그게 다 돈인데? 그렇지 않습니다. 역사적으로 전쟁이 벌어지는 이유는 돈과 권력이었습니다. 뭔 소리하는 줄 못 알아 듣겠다면, 징기스칸으로 알려진 몽골 유목민을 예로 생각해보면 쉽게 이해가 될 것인데요. Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are facing off Tuesday night in the first and only vice presidential debate of the cycle, as the two candidates look to prop up the Republican and Democratic tickets.Here's what to know about both candidates' views and policy record. pic.twitter.com/mIprxgWIKG Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act—gutting access to life saving care for 45 million Americans, like Tina—with no plan to replace it.As president, I will continue fighting to make health care more affordable for middle class families. pic.twitter.com/WZK7VeW2cq Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) went into the vice-presidential debate with a plan to surprise Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz by being shockingly ... super-duper nice. https://t.co/yUlBmaQgIY 몽골 유목민들은 농사를 짓지 않습니다. 왜? 다른 종족, 국가의 경작지를 약탈한 후 약탈이 끝나면 다른 '농경 지대'를 약탈하니 농사를 지을 필요가 없었고 농업 인력에 들어갈 비용도 노예(군수물자 지원계)로 충당할 수 있습니다. 모든 '인구'를 군사력에 집중하면 되니 인류 역사상 가장 영토가 넓었던 몽골 제국이 탄생했던 것이죠. Minnesota-based Vista Outdoor has agreed to sell its sporting goods and ammunition units for a total of $3.35 billion https://t.co/fEwDKsuMVj Megyn Kelly says Kamala Harris message ’working’: ’She’s somehow getting through’ https://t.co/WeoQ3Dxmur The blockbuster jobs report just gave Kamala Harris a boost where she needs it most https://t.co/lEfFVwVWiI 예제 8. "ISM '비제조업' PMI가 예상치를 상회했다.", "S&P Global '서비스' PMI 소폭 하락했지만 여전히 예상치를 상회했다."면 무슨 생각이 드나요? 서비스 부문이 18개월 만에 '최고치'를 기록했는데, "8월 '공장 주문'이 예상치를 '하회'하며 감소했다."면 무슨 생각이 드나요? 미국 경제가 망했다? 아니라니까? The ever-resilient US economy is once again causing havoc for Wall Street worrywarts, who have sounded the recession alarm all year https://t.co/R4XW8b9fzM The steady march of robots into factories isn't diabolical but pragmatic: companies will spend on automation when it makes sense and when it doesn't, they won't. https://t.co/8y0IrnaXfw 첫째, 미국 제조업에 '슈퍼 코어' 인플레이션이 미치는 영향이 어떤지 생각 안 들까요? 둘째, 미국 공장 주문이 감소했다면, 왜 감소할까요? 글로벌 경기침체죠. 왜? 글로벌 경기가 안 좋으니까 안 팔리니 주문이 감소하지 않았을까요? 둘째, 중국 제품이 더 팔렸기 때문일 수도 있겠죠. 이게 무역 분쟁이자 세계 패권 경쟁이라고 말한 新냉전시대입니다. The US is "well ahead in terms of the deployment of AI."KKR's Waldemar Szlezak tells David Westin the scale of America's data centers while Burns & McDonnell's Christine Wood discusses how to overcome hurdles.

Global food prices saw the largest jump in 2.5 years in September, with sugar prices leading an across-the-board increase for commodities including wheat and edible oil https://t.co/J0XtoRDh9n Bloomberg’s Trade Tracker shows 2 out of 10 key measures of global commerce in “below normal” territory, while 8 are in “normal” zone https://t.co/bmEhTNGM3b pic.twitter.com/X300VtYWvP President Joe Biden touted his jobs record during a White House press briefing. He says the has created 16 million jobs since taking office, but says there's more work to do to lower costs for Americans https://t.co/EMQCwuJNfw pic.twitter.com/zjIKteD6I2 무슨 생각 들죠? 2분기 GDP 성장률 -0.2% 역성장을 내놓고 초부자(super rich) 감세라 불리는 법인세 인하로 세수를 30조 원 펑크를 내놓은 '윤석열' 생각이 '안 드나'요? '윤석열'이 하던 소리 아닌가요? 2분기 연율 '2%' 성장한 일본은 소비(내수)에서 나오는 서비스 부문 성장이 둔화(침체)되고 있고, 'IMF'는 인플레이션에 맞춘 금리인상을 조언했습니다. "야, 소비(내수) 안 된다며?" Mohamed El-Erian says the Fed needs to renew its focus on its fight against rising prices after September’s surprisingly hot jobs report served as a reminder that “inflation is not dead.” https://t.co/AuWgCQGgOF President Biden sought to discourage Israel from attacking Iran’s oil fields, even as he said the country has the right to respond after Tehran’s ballistic-missile barrage earlier this week. https://t.co/i99JpY5lTu With the presidential election a month away, the US has limited leverage to stop Netanyahu's escalation in the Middle East https://t.co/RzUvnGYxLu 아니라니까? LNG, 전기요금, 특히 유가가 일본, 한국이라고 예외가 돼 반영이 안 될까요? 더 쉽게 아프리카 '케냐', '가나'에 LNG, 전기요금, 특히 유가가 '인플레이션'에 반영 안 되나요? 되죠? 그럼 어디에 반영될까요? 중앙은행 금리 정책에 반영됩니다. Europe’s heavy industry, scarred by recent energy-price shocks, is likely to curtail gas use for years https://t.co/iYIVp8p9iz The dollar is about to notch its best week in two years https://t.co/b1OK23nYwZ Gold edges higher, on track for post a modest weekly rise https://t.co/K8HYCeZ28s 왜 미 국채 금리가 튀는지는 위에서 말하였고, 예제 9. 미 국채금리가 튀면 무슨 일이 벌어질까요? 기축통화국인 미국 달러화 대비 화폐가치가 하락합니다. 왜? 달러투자 하기 때문이죠. 왜? 달러 화폐가치가 높아집니다. 왜? 무역에 쓰이는 기축통화이기 때문이죠. 그래서 금(gold)과 함께 안전자산이라 불리는 이유들 중 하나입니다. 달러-엔 환율은 어떻게 '됐을까'요? These are the 12 global economic indicators to watch https://t.co/zO8hMU9xbF 이것도 다시 말 해야하나? 달러-엔 환율이 오르면 뭐가 문제죠? 일본은 자급자족 하나요? 수입해야죠. 원자재 가격이 상승합니다. 그럼 '무슨 일'이 벌어지죠? '한국'과 유사한 사회·경제 현상들 중에 부익빈 빈익빈이 가중되는 양극화 → 저출산 등이 나타납니다. 왜? 국민들이 돈이 없는데 뭔 수로 애를 낳고 기르죠? 돈 대신 땅 파서 키우게? 이래서 '한국' 정치, 경제를 몽땅, 싹 다 말아 먹은 '윤석열'에 돌아섰던 것입니다. 다시? 중국 실용주의 손자병법에서 말하는 승률 100%의 방법은 이길 전쟁인지, 질 전쟁인지 부터 판단하고 지는 전쟁은 하지 않는 것입니다. '윤석열', 김건희가 그렇게 설처댔는데 경제까지 이모양이니 무슨 수로 선거를 이기죠? India aspires to be a developed nation by 2047, but the path must also adhere to the nation’s climate and energy security goals. https://t.co/Y5OBqQH5NX As India edges closer to Israel and the Gulf Arab states – such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the same level of engagement with Iran as before. https://t.co/SxAApJjVr0 India’s government appointed three new external members to the central bank’s committee that decides interest rates, just a few days before a scheduled policy meeting https://t.co/8T94phB2g0 "청년들이여 집을 '사세요.♡'"라고 청년들이 집 샀나요? 못 샀죠? 왜? 돈이 없으니까. 그나마 영끌을 한 청년들도 신혼부부 특별공급을 노리고 위장결혼을 했거나 이자 부담에 소비를 줄여야 하니 애 낳을 생각은 꿈도 못꾸고 있습니다. '윤석열'이 또 뭐 했죠? 그린벨트, 개발제한구역 풀어서 로또 청약으로 투기 광풍을 만들었습니다. "야, 그럼 뭐 해야하냐?" 중국처럼 현금 바우처를 지급하고 직장에서 특히 여성들의 '육아 환경'을 보장해 줘야 합니다. 왜? '자식'이 눈에 밟혀서 손에 잡히는 게 없었는데 엄마야 오죽할 것이고 애들이 엄마를 얼마나 찾을까요? Here's why India’s giant options market poses a danger to financial stability https://t.co/jmyTAJNJQ4 Blackstone plans to raise more than $10 billion in its third Asia private equity fund as the firm ramps up deployment in Japan and India https://t.co/o6TpId1JOW 환율은 인플레이션율에 반영되겠죠. 왜? 원자재 수입 가격이 오른다니까요? 지금 뭐가 가장 큰 문제가 되고 있죠?

Title: Wall Street gains as US jobs data eases economic worries

US stocks have closed higher as investors digested a labour report that indicated unemployment slipped last month. Photo / 123RF The Dow has posted a record closing high and the Nasdaq ended with a more than a 1% gain as a stronger-than-expected jobs report reassured investors who had worried the economy may be getting too weak. US job gains increased in September by the most in six months and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, the report showed. The data “basically tells us economic activity in the fourth quarter is likely to remain at a solid pace,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It’s a good surprise but I also think it may now slow the pace of rate cuts.” Traders further reduced bets on a 50-basis-point reduction at the Federal Reserve’s November 6-7 meeting. Traders are pricing in just an 8% chance of a 50-bps rate cut, down from about 31% earlier on Friday, the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool showed. The Fed kicked off a monetary easing cycle last month with a 50 basis point rate cut. Small caps and financials outperformed, with the Russell 2000 index up 1.5% and the S&P 500 financials index up 1.6%. Spirit Airlines shares dropped 24.6% while other airlines jumped after a report showed Spirit was in talks with bondholders about a potential bankruptcy filing. Frontier Group shot up 16.4% while United Airlines rose 6.5% and Delta Air Lines climbed 3.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341.16 points, or 0.81%, to 42,352.75, the S&P 500 gained 51.13 points, or 0.90%, to 5751.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 219.37 points, or 1.22%, to 18,137.85. Indices registered just slight gains for the week following worries about increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Dow was up 0.1% while the S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq was up 0.1%. The S&P energy index rose 1.1% on the day along with higher oil prices. With the Middle East concerns, the index jumped 7.0% for the week in its biggest weekly percentage gain since October 2022. US President Joe Biden said that if he were in Israel’s shoes, he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran’s missile barrage this week. Rivian shares fell 3.2% after the electric vehicle startup cut its full-year production forecast and delivered fewer vehicles than expected in the third quarter. Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to unofficially begin next week. Major financial firms highlight next week’s reports, with JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and BlackRock due on October 11. Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20.6% for the year so far. US ports on the east and Gulf coasts reopened but clearing the cargo backlog will likely take time. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.20-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 91 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 10.91 billion shares compared with the 12.03 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. New builds of smaller homes won't cater for changing demands of older people.
