REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Nvidia and Elon Musk's xAI have joined a consortium backed by Microsoft and BlackRock to expand artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S., the companies said on Wednesday, as a global race to dominate the nascent technology intensifies. The group, formed last year with a goal to initially invest more than $30 billion in AI-related projects, is one of the biggest efforts to bankroll data centers and energy facilities needed to power AI applications such as ChatGPT. The additions come two months after U.S. President Donald Trump announced Stargate, a private sector AI infrastructure initiative backed by SoftBank Group, OpenAI and Oracle, with plans to mobilize up to $500 billion. Investors have committed $100 billion for immediate deployment, with the rest expected over the next four years. The consortium- which includes Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm MGX and BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners - on Wednesday renamed itself as AI Infrastructure Partnership. Nvidia, a technical advisor, will continue in the role. Training AI models and large-scale data processing require huge computational power, which increases energy consumption. To meet the demands, tech companies are deploying thousands of chips in clusters, driving a surge for specialized data centers. To fund the computing and power needs, the consortium has been looking to raise money from investors, asset owners and corporations, with a goal to mobilize up to $100 billion, including debt financing. "AIP has attracted significant capital and partner interest since its inception in September," the group said, but did not disclose the total funds raised so far. GE Vernova and utility firm NextEra Energy will also be a part of the group, it said, adding the renewable energy company will work on supply-chain planning and high efficiency energy solutions. AIP said its investments will also focus on U.S. partners and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Title: As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock

ByGiacomo Tognini During his speech to a joint session of Congress on March 4, President Donald Trump touted a deal that had closed that day for two ports on the Panama Canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” he said, to applause from the politicians gathered at the Capitol. The deal to which he was referring was the sale of 43 ports owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for $23 billion—and the two Panama ports were just a small part of it. What Trump didn’t say: one of the two partners in the deal, Terminal Investment Limited, is an arm of Swiss shipping giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, commonly known as MSC, cofounded by Swiss-Italian billionaires Gianluigi and Rafaela Aponte in 1970. While the ownership structure of the sale hasn’t been made public, the deal will turn MSC into the largest port operator in the world, with stakes in more than 100 terminals in 54 countries, including eight in the U.S. and three in Panama. MSC owns 70% of Terminal Investment, while investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners—led by U.S. billionaire Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi and now owned by BlackRock, which bought it for $12.5 billion in October—holds 20% and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC owns the remaining 10%. Ogunlesi and the Apontes first teamed up in 2013, when GIP bought a 35% stake in Terminal Investment from MSC for $1.4 billion before selling part of its shares in 2019 and 2021. U.S. billionaire Adebayo Ogunlesi is cofounder of private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which first invested in the Apontes' Terminal Investment Ltd. in 2013. Pending approval from European and Panamanian regulators, the deal will see BlackRock and Terminal Investment take over CK Hutchison’s ports outside of China and Hong Kong for a cash payment of $18 billion plus the assumption of $5 billion in debt. It’s the latest in a string of acquisitions for the Apontes, whose MSC overtook publicly traded Danish rival Maersk to become the world’s largest container shipping line in early 2022. Now, it’s set to overtake Maersk in terms of its port network as well. “[MSC’s] growth in liner shipping capacity has gone hand-in-glove with this huge expansion in terminal capacity,” says Eirik Hooper, senior associate of ports and terminals at maritime research firm Drewry. “The two businesses clearly support each other and provide opportunities for operational synergies at a huge scale.” For its part, BlackRock's investment in ports comes little more than a year after it announced the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, with the firm touting infrastructure as a $1 trillion market set to grow even further thanks to increasing investment in assets such as airports, railroads and shipping ports. BlackRock's billionaire CEO Larry Fink called infrastructure “one of the most exciting long-term investment opportunities" in a statement at the time. After the CK Hutchison deal closes—and unless local regulators require it to divest from the port it currently owns—MSC will hold stakes in three ports on the Panama Canal, with two on the Pacific Ocean side and one on the Atlantic. Even before the CK Hutchison deal, MSC has spent more than $40 billion since January 2022, according to Forbes estimates, investing in everything from new ports to hospitals and even a high-speed rail company in Italy. The bulk of that was new ships: over the past three years, the firm has bought or ordered 370 vessels for more than $31 billion, according to ship valuation experts VesselsValue. The secretive, closely-held MSC doesn’t publish financial data and declined to comment on them, but according to documents obtained by Italian newspaper Il Messaggero it ended 2022 with $68 billion in cash, thanks to a surge in freight rates during the pandemic as snarled supply chains powered shipping firms to record profits. Ownership of MSC is split equally between Aponte (the chairman, who was born in Italy but is now a Swiss citizen and lives in Geneva) and his wife Rafaela Aponte-Diamant, who helped him found the firm when he quit his job at a bank and started MSC with a $200,000 loan to buy their first ship in 1970. Forbes estimates they are each worth $37.5 billion, enough to make Aponte-Diamant the richest self-made woman in the world. That’s a combined $58 billion more than their estimated net worth in early 2022. A spokesperson for MSC declined to comment on the valuation and didn’t make either Aponte available for an interview. “Even before it was clear how good the pandemic would end up being [for shippers], Aponte was buying everything that was available and expanding,” says John McCown, a shipping expert at the think tank Center for Maritime Strategy. “It’s a bold strategy, but it’s worked out for them so far.” While the pandemic-driven boom helped all shippers, MSC benefited more than its rivals. According to Il Messaggero, it posted $93 billion in revenues and $46 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2022, beating out Maersk and CMA CGM, owned by the billionaire Saadé family of France. And even as its passenger cruise line suffered—swinging from a $456 million net profit in 2019 to a three-year run of Covid-induced net losses totalling more than $3 billion—the success of its container shipping business more than made up for it: MSC’s EBITDA rose by more than 600% from 2020 to 2022, compared to 350% for Maersk and 445% for CMA CGM. MSC used the cash it earned in the pandemic years to expand its empire beyond the sea, targeting companies that transport the goods to their final destinations on land as well as picking up firms in other areas of shipping outside of containers. Since January 2022, MSC has spent more than $3.6 billion buying up stakes in 10 companies including a trucking firm, a cargo airline, a car carrier, two logistic firms, a tugboat operator and a freight forwarding outfit, which acts as an intermediary between companies shipping products and their final destination, organizing the goods' transport by sea, rail, road or air. “These freight forwarding companies are just a way of feeding the monster. It's a source of additional volume,” says McCown. “With all the compelling growth that MSC is doing, that's not surprising." Flush with cash, MSC even partnered with South African billionaire Johann Rupert’s Remgro to buy South Africa-based Mediclinic, a chain of private hospitals, for $4.6 billion in August 2022. Its next big move outside of shipping came in October 2023, when it bought 50% of Italian high-speed rail firm Italo from Ogunlesi’s Global Infrastructure Partners for $2.2 billion. MSC has operated a cruise business since 1988 and bought a Mediterranean ferry company in 2010, but this was its first foray into passenger rail. Diego Aponte, Gianluigi and Rafaela's son and MSC's president, said in a statement at the time that the purchase reflected the group's "goal of further developing sustainable modes of transport, for both passengers and cargo.” The deal closed in May 2024, and it’s likely to become another good bet for Aponte: Italo posted a $178 million profit on $926 million revenues in 2023, up 36% and 21%, respectively, over the previous year. The Apontes had also been growing their ports empire before the CK Hutchison deal. MSC bought 50% of South Korea’s Busan port in March 2022, and eight months later it purchased Bolloré Africa Logistics—a collection of container terminals, dry ports, railways and logistics services owned by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré's Bolloré Group—for $5.9 billion. The acquisition made MSC the largest logistics firm in Africa and the seventh largest port owner in the world. Last November, it acquired a 49.9% stake in German publicly traded logistics company HHLA—which owns major ports in Hamburg, Estonia, Italy and Odessa, Ukraine—for $700 million. MSC owns the largest container shipping fleet in the world with 20% of total fleet capacity, ahead of its closest rivals Maersk (14%) and CMA CGM (12%), according to shipping data firm Alphaliner. “It's beneficial to have ports that you own. It allows you to get priority,” says Ben Slupecki, an analyst at Morningstar, pointing to the benefits of buying more ports alongside a larger fleet. “These are valued assets in the industry.” All of this has helped put MSC in a stronger position than ever and likely led to its announcement in January 2023 that it planned to end its 10-year partnership with Maersk, known as the 2M alliance. First set up in 2015, the alliance, which officially expired in January, allowed the two companies to lower costs by sharing capacity on 185 ships on routes traveling from ports in northern Europe and north America to Asia. Maersk has moved onto a different alliance while MSC is going alone. “They have 20% of global capacity, so they've achieved the size where they no longer need to operate an alliance,” adds Slupecki. Besides, with partners like Ogunlesi and now Fink’s BlackRock, it likely doesn’t need more support. And Aponte isn’t done expanding: his firm is reportedly planning to increase its stake in Spanish billionaire Vicente Boluda Fos’ tugboat firm Boluda Towage to 49% by May, which would make MSC the largest towage company in the world. MSC may not be able to keep up that high spending forever. After years of breakneck growth, the tide is turning for shipping firms. Freight prices have fallen from their peak in 2022, sitting about 50% higher than their levels before the pandemic in 2019. That slowdown, combined with the potential impact of Trump’s tariffs and any ensuing trade war, could put a damper on MSC’s profits. "If the tariffs stick, it'll put a real dent in container volume to and from the U.S. That's 25% to 30% of world container miles,” adds McCown. Still, that’s a relatively small slice of the global container trade. And while MSC may have to sell part of its ports in the Netherlands and Panama to appease regulators examining the CK Hutchison deal—plus fend off a potential Chinese government investigation into the agreement itself—it will still likely own stakes in more than 100 ports, more than anyone else. That size, combined with the fact it commands the world’s largest fleet of container ships, makes it less vulnerable than its competitors to any downturn. “The largest firms that have the ability to invest, like MSC, can probably weather a pretty big storm and come out the other side,” says Slupecki. “That might not be the case for some of their competitors. In some ways, that's an advantage for them to take further market share even if they struggle.”

Title: Chinese FM and HK chief executive respond to inquiries on CK Hutchison's controversial Panama deal

Global Times By Chen Qingqing Published: Mar 18, 2025 01:22 PM When asked whether the Chinese Foreign Ministry can confirm or give more details on media reports that Chinese authorities are investigating CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports after the company agreed to sell its Panama operations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday that "on your specific question, I'd refer you to competent authorities. Let me stress more broadly that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." After two central government bodies in Hong Kong reposted two opinion pieces criticizing CK Hutchison Holdings for its decision to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by an American asset manager BlackRock, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday, before attending the Executive Council meeting, that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics in international economic and trade relations, Hong Kong media RTHK reported. When commenting on the matter on Tuesday, Lee expressed three views, according to Wen Wei Po. First, he noted that there has been much discussion in society about the issue, reflecting public concern, which deserves attention. Second, he emphasized that the HKSAR government expects foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for businesses, including Hong Kong enterprises, and opposes the use of coercion or pressure tactics. Third, he stated that any transaction must comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and the HKSAR government will handle the matter in accordance with the law and regulations, Wen Wei Po reported. Hong Kong-based Ta Kung Pao last week published two opinion pieces questioning the CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports. In the Saturday piece, it asked, "Why are so many important ports so easily transferred to the US forces that harbor malicious intentions? What kind of political calculations are hidden behind the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Has the so-called 'shrewd' deal taken into account the interests of the country and the nation? Is such a choice actually helping the evildoers and bringing harm to China and the world?" The article also warned if one fails to see clearly the true nature of those US politicians who "not only want money but also want you to die," and chooses to dance with them, one might perhaps manage to make a fortune for a while, but in the end, there will be no future, and what's more, one will incur the condemnation of history. Ta Kung Pao also published an opinion piece on Thursday saying that this deal is a hegemonic act in which the US uses its national power to usurp the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure and inducement. It is a form of power politics dressed up as a "commercial act." The article urged relevant companies to think twice about the nature and crux of the issue, and also ponder about what stance to take and which side to stand on. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have reposted on their websites the two opinion pieces published by Ta Kung Pao. Leung Chun-ying, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, published a post on social media on Monday, asking without naming anyone: "Do businessmen have a motherland?" Wen Wei Po reported on Tuesday. Leung stated that some Hong Kong businessmen mistakenly believe in the notion that "business knows no borders" and assume that everything is purely business. However, businessmen without a motherland will only face bullying. He emphasized that businessmen should also prioritize their country. He pointed out that American businessmen can only act in alignment with US interests and cannot do anything that goes against them. He concluded that this inherent relationship between American businessmen and their country applies equally to other nations, including the UK, Canada, and Singaporeâ"and China is no exception." As the US is intensifying its efforts to undermine China's shipbuilding industry, shipping sector, and the Belt and Road Initiative in an attempt to contain China's rise, this deal would inevitably pose a threat to national interests and security, Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. "I believe that before making business decisions, the company should fully and seriously consider the complexity of the international landscape and the well-being of the nation and its people. After all, key infrastructure holds significant strategic value, and its critical role in great-power competition should not be underestimated," Lau added.

Title: Administrators take majority control of national childcare chain

(ABC News: Joel Wilson) Administrators have been appointed to run the majority of Genius Childcare centres. The ABC has also found Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from Genius workers. Genius owner Darren Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment. Administrators have taken control of the majority of childcare centres run by teetering empire Genius. Nicholas Charlwood, Alan Walker, and Glenn Livingstone of WLP Restructuring took control of 12 centres on Wednesday, bringing the total they control to 25. The ABC can also reveal that dozens of workers at Genius have lodged formal complaints about wage underpayment since 2016. Documents obtained under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws show Australia’s industrial watchdog has received at least 30 requests for help from workers at Genius, which is run by Melbourne businessman Darren Misquitta. The Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) is investigating the group, a spokesperson told the ABC, as more employees face uncertainty in the wake of the collapses. Dozens of Genius workers have lodged complaints via the Fair Work Ombudsman. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Genius’s financial woes come as the childcare industry is in the spotlight following a Four Corners investigation on Monday that raised concerns about child safety and revealed the sector is plagued by poor regulation and high staff turnover. Until recently, Genius was a rapidly-expanding childcare empire with at least 28 centres across the country and another 17 in development. But yesterday WLP’s partners were appointed administrators of subsidiary Abacus 49, which runs 12 centres in Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Western Australia. The administrators said they will continue to run the centres as usual while “urgently assessing the financial affairs of Abacus 49”. Finexia, a Gold Coast-based finance group that runs childcare funds, appointed the same administrators last week to take control of another Genius subsidiary, Vertical 4. The administrators are continuing to run 11 centres owned by Vertical 4. The new collapses add to the sudden shut down of centres in Adelaide, Canberra and Sydney which are in various states of collapse due to staff walkouts because of unpaid wages, landlord disputes and suspensions by state regulators for repeated child health and safety breaches. Another company in the Genius group, Horizontal 1, collapsed in December owing $9.6m. In a report to creditors last month, liquidator Paul Vartelas said Horizontal 1, which was formerly known as Genius Education, “did not have sufficient realisable current assets available to meet its short-term liabilities at any time” since June 30, 2020. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta is accused of systematically and deliberately failing to pay superannuation to employees and paying wages late. (LinkedIn) Other woes of the Genius group include a lawsuit by former employees who allege they haven’t been paid their entitlements. Jodie Henderson told the ABC she is owed at least $36,000 in unpaid redundancy entitlements and hundreds of annual leave hours, after the centre she managed in Granville, Queensland, closed abruptly last month. It was ousted by centre landlords, who changed the locks without staff knowledge, owing thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and weeks of pay to 19 now-redundant educators. “I’ve got educators who have defaulted on loan payments, mortgage payments … I’ve got educators going to food banks and to churches to get support with feeding their families,” Ms Henderson said. Jodie Henderson says Genius Childcare owes her thousands of dollars. (Supplied: Jodie Henderson) Ms Henderson said Genius had failed to issue redundant staff with separation certificates making it difficult for them to claim urgent unemployment benefits. “Between my team and myself, I’m going to estimate we’ve sent at least 40 to 50 emails to payroll requesting them, [asking] 'can you tell us what’s happening?'” she said. “And none of us have had responses.” She said staff and children had personal and medical belongings locked inside the centre, including epipens and asthma puffers. “This is most definitely the lowest of the low,” she said. “It’s left a lot of people with a very bad view of working in the early childhood sector.” Documents provided by the FWO under FOI laws show Genius workers have complained that the company hasn’t paid their full wages, given them incorrect payslips, failed to pay them for up to six weeks and failed to pay leave entitlements and superannuation. “They are ignoring me,” one former worker, who claimed Genius hadn’t paid their final wages plus annual and long service leave, told the ombudsman in a November 2016 request for assistance. Concerns about the group’s financial state were raised as early as November 2017, when a fired worker complained that she had not received her last two weeks pay and her entitlements. “They dismissed two other EEs (employees) at the same time so they may be in financial difficulties,” the worker alleged in her complaint, according to a file note. Another worker alleged she was fired from Genius after raising problems with her pay. Complaints against Genius Childcare were filed as early as 2016. (Supplied) In a 2021 complaint, a worker said that because their centre was understaffed they had to work large amounts of unpaid overtime in order to comply with minimum staff to child ratios. “The overtime I worked was due to not having enough staff therefore in the afternoons we would have to stay back until the ratio dropped enough that we could go home,” the worker said in an email to the FWO. In November last year, multiple staff complained that the company was paying wages late. One Genius worker said that “no staff have been paid, pay is late from everyone”, according to a file note made by an officer at the ombudsman. “Staff are calling management but have not heard back.” A second worker told the FWO “the entirety of the company have experienced late pay” for the past year. “She believes she was paid because the staff did not show up to work on Monday and told the business they had other job interviews lined up and they were paid within 20 minutes,” an FWO officer said in a file note. Vertical 4, which was formerly known as Genius Learning, was also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock over unpaid rent. Court documents show a property fund run by Blackrock claims to be owed more than $1.4m in rent from centres in Granville (Queensland), Corinda (Queensland), Christie Downs (South Australia) and Cranbourne West (Victoria). The administrators have plans to sell some centres and operate others in the meantime. (ABC News: Joel Wilson) Mr Charlwood, Mr Livingstone and Mr Walker said that of the 11 Vertical 4 centres they are running, there were agreements in place to immediately sell five — in Mont Albert (Victoria), Beaumaris (Victoria), Reservoir (Victoria), Kenmore (Queensland) and Gowrie (ACT). Six of the centres — in Hamilton Hill (Western Australia), Lakelands (WA), Mandurah (WA), Newcomb (Victoria), Castle Hill (NSW) and Pyrmont (NSW) — will continue to be operated by the administrators for the time being. Two additional centres, in Eumemmerring (Victoria) and Cranbourne West (Victoria), have yet to open. Mr Misquitta did not respond to requests for comment.

(Article byÂ Clayton J. BakerÂ republished from Brownstone.org) In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDAâs leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled.Â All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trumpâs entire second term. The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Ga. should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. TheÂ Kawaoka Bird flu labÂ at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has hadÂ multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry.Â Individuals such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. President Trump should follow through on hisÂ 2024 promiseÂ to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).Â Mr. Trumpâs instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. The $590 Million dollar Bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trumpâs inauguration should be cancelled.Â The USDAâs reported âconditional approvalâ of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled.Â Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks hasÂ been demonstratedÂ in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, theÂ CEOÂ of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock, and theÂ Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the Covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The âpandemic preparednessâ racket isnât as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact thatÂ the arsonists are running the fire departmentÂ â as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well â we can recognize what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

The personnel at the CDC need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.Â TheÂ CDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trumpâs executive order silencing HHS agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon theÂ Covid-era âpandemic planningâ model of public health. For example, acting directorÂ Susan Monarez, PhDâs bio shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC?

Read more at:Â Brownstone.org In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on, and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current Bird flu panic is this:Â Bird flu is a complete rerun of the Covid script.Â There is just one twist: Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Hereâs how: End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately.Â ThisÂ disgusting, death-wish practiceÂ is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns duringÂ Covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyzes decision-makers, and promotes population-wide blackmail.

Read more at:Â Brownstone.org Last time, with Covid, the pandemic-planning bioterroristsÂ directlyÂ blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, in order to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists areÂ indirectlyÂ blackmailing us by targeting our food, in order to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives.

Read more at:Â Brownstone.org Letâs review. What happened during Covid? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In late 2019, the lab-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS CoV-2, was leaked from a lab. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, âpublic healthâ authorities took advantage of the lab leak by denying its occurrence, while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. To perpetuate the lockdowns, âpublic healthâ authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. The authorities used this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies, in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now, with H5N1 Bird flu? Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The âpandemic plannersâ are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach.

Read more at:Â Brownstone.org Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of âpandemic preparedness,â have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated Bird flu bioweaponÂ leakedÂ from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, GA. Multiple Bird flu leaks have alsoÂ occurredÂ from other labs. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed intoÂ production, âpublic healthâ authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence, while simultaneously coercing our government to imposeÂ mass slaughter of farm animals, creatingÂ food shortagesÂ for the human population. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, âpublic healthâ authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. Authorities are using this excessive testing along withÂ media-generated fear-mongeringÂ and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life.

It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatizes farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals, and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately.Â A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment â you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough.

The DeFi sector is “substantially undervalued,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said Tuesday in an interview with Decrypt, arguing Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui and Aptos “definitely tick the boxes” for courting institutional investors. The executive said he sees a case for issuers launching SUI and Apots ETFs in the U.S.—a development that may bring renewed investments into those altcoins. The asset manager already filed for an Aptos ETF earlier this month, but it has no such application pending for a SUI-based fund. Still, projects led by ex-Meta stablecoin team members “definitely tick the boxes of serious team, serious technology [and] technological differentiation,” Hougan said, referencing a few of Bitwise’s requirements for the assets held by its funds. “I wouldn't put 100% of my portfolio in Sui, but I wouldn't put [in] zero,” he said. Bitwise is one of several investment firms that has filed a flurry of crypto ETF applications with federal regulators in the U.S. The spate of applications comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission— the crypto industry’s main regulator in the U.S.—has signaled its willingness to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance under recently elected President Donald Trump. Issuers have requested to roll out funds tracking the prices of a wide range of cryptos, from meme coins such as Bonk and Dogecoin to larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana to Official Trump. Bitwise itself is in the process of securing approval for single-asset ETFs that track XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—tokens that are especially popular with DeFi proponents. Although those altcoins are down from the highs they brushed last January, Hougan believes changing tides in the U.S. regulatory climate could boost DeFi tokens and the projects to which they are linked. “The market hasn’t come to grips with the fact that these tokens could change their tokenomics and be money printing machines in a new regulatory environment,” Hougan said, citing Uniswap, Ondo, and Aave as projects with enormous potential for growth. That new regulatory climate may allow utility tokens with value drivers to thrive, he said, eliminating a major issue in DeFi—the pervasiveness of “squishy governance tokens.” According to Hougan, that potential for growth could render DeFi tokens and other non-blue chip assets well-suited for inclusion in ETF wrappers in the future. Increasing access to crypto-based ETFs Although Bitwise is hardly “throwing spaghetti against the wall” when it picks assets to include in its funds, Hougan noted that Bitwise and other issuers aims to file for new ETFs often. “In ETF land, not in crypto land, this is normal,” Hougan said. “ETF issuers file for a lot of ETFs all the time. Although Hougan declined to specify which assets Bitwise's future funds could track, he said the firm is looking at tokens linked to “high quality” and “interesting” projects with “real potential” to track in single-asset ETFs. The asset manager also listens to its clients when deciding which assets it should offer in ETF wrappers. The firm’s idea, he said, is to give its clients ample options for where to put their money. “I don't want to be paternalistic about what they should access,” Hougan said. The executive said it’s reasonable for issuers to provide clients exposure to all kinds of assets—even those they might not highly recommend—as long as those assets aren’t linked to rug pulls or scams. “Blackrock offers a lot of bond funds, but I wouldn't buy a 30-year Treasury fund if you held a gun to my head,” Hougan said. He added, “I'm not going to tell anyone to invest in Doge, but I could tell someone if you're going to invest in Doge, it's probably cheaper to do in the ETF, and there's probably less risk.” Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

The Tokenization Grand Prix aims to diversify Spark's stablecoin reserves by investing $1 billion in tokenized funds. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spark has announced that BlackRock, Superstate, and Centrifuge are the winners of its Tokenization Grand Prix. The goal is to allocate $1 billion in tokenized assets, with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund set to receive half of it. The competition, launched in July 2024, allocated funds through the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). The initiative aimed to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) to diversify Spark’s balance sheet while expanding stablecoin adoption in DeFi. The final allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. If approved, the initiative will also invest $300 million in Superstate’s USTB and $200 million in Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY. Currently, the Spark Liquidity Layer holds USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. The protocol will use these stablecoins to add BUIDL, USTB, and JTRSY. The competition attracted 39 applications, reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm specializing in RWAs within the Spark ecosystem. Applicants were assessed based on pricing transparency, liquidity levels, and strategic alignment with Spark’s objectives. Spark picked each of these RWA tokens backed by US Treasury securities, suggesting a preference for liquid and conservative assets. BUIDL is offered by BlackRock and tokenized by Securitize. The money fund invests in US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. BUIDL is the largest tokenized money fund, with over $1.2 billion in market cap as of March 18. Spark’s incoming investment could propel it close to $2 billion. Meanwhile, Superstate’s USTB focuses on short-duration US Treasury bills maturing in six months or less, ensuring a predictable and secure yield. It is significantly smaller than BUIDL, with $370 million participation in the market. Lastly, Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY allocates money to a short-duration US Treasury fund that reinvests in new issuances as existing securities mature. With a market cap of $32.4 million, JTRSY is also the smallest of the three tokenized funds potentially to receive Spark’s investment. If approved, Spark’s investments in BlackRock/Securitize, Superstate, and Centrifuge will mark a significant step in integrating tokenized RWAs into DeFi infrastructure.

Title: Breaking Down Strategy’s Recent Preferred Stock Offerings

ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo , Contributor. MIAMI, FLORIDA - JUNE 04: MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, ... [+] a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. The crypto conference is expected to draw 50,000 people and runs from Friday, June 4 through June 6th. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Strategy, the rebranded MicroStrategy and the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, made headlines earlier today as it unveiled its latest preferred stock offering, STRF. The company launched a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (ticker: STRF), subject to market conditions. The new offering aims to raise capital for general corporate purposes, with a significant portion earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital. The new STRF offering introduces a hybrid security designed to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility compared to Strategy’s volatile common stock (MSTR). The STRF shares will be sold at market price. Strategy offers a liquidation price of $100/share. The liquidation price offered by the company is the amount per share that preferred shareholders are entitled to receive in the event of the company’s liquidation or dissolution, after satisfying debts but before distributing anything to common shareholders. It represents the preferred stock’s claim on assets. The STRF stock’s dividends compound at an initial rate of 10% annually plus 1% for unpaid amounts, escalating by 1% per period up to a maximum of 18% per annum until settled. The dividend is payable quarterly in arrears starting June 30, 2025, if declared by Strategy’s board of directors. Assuming the full offering is executed as planned, the company would take on a potential $50,000,000 annual dividend obligation. This is Strategy’s second preferred offering that offers a dividend. Earlier this year the company issued 7.3 Million of Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, STRK, offering a fixed annual dividend of 8%. This issuance netted the company $563.4 million in proceeds and represents a potential total annual dividend obligation of approximately $58,400,000. Strategy’s potential cumulative annual dividend obligation from the STRK and STRF offerings, if both are fully executed as outlined, is approximately $108.4 million ($58.4 million for STRK and $50 million for STRF). This figure assumes full issuance and declared dividends. Actual payments depend on board decisions and financial health, making the obligation conditional rather than fixed. The actual dividend amount to be paid may also be higher if dividends go unpaid and triggers rates to escalate from the initial 10%. The nature of these instruments has sparked a debate online regarding Strategy’s ability to pay the dividends, methods through which it could do so, and what happens if the company doesn’t generate the necessary cash to pay down the preferred stock dividends offered. First, it’s important to note that, based on the offering details, Strategy has no obligation to issue or pay the dividends. They are all subject to board approval. While it is an option available to the company, not declaring or paying the dividends could impact the share prices significantly. Second, we can contrast the potential dividend obligations with the company’s operating cashflows from its software business. Strategy’s Q4 2024 earnings report notes $126.6 million in total revenue for the year, but this likely includes some Bitcoin-related adjustments post-adoption of FASB ASU 2023-08 (effective January 1, 2025), which mandates fair value accounting for Bitcoin. Excluding Bitcoin gains, the software business’s contribution to cash flow is likely in the range of $100–150 million annually, based on historical adjusted EBITDA figures. For further context, these were $80-$100 million in 2022-2023, per earlier filings. If we assume that Strategy’s software business is generating ~$100-$150 million in operational cash flow contributions, the fact that they have just taken on a potential $108.4 million dividend commitment has prompted some investors to ask “what happens if they need to come up with more cash to pay the dividend?”. The answer is that a) the company is not obligated to declare or pay the dividends and b) it could resort to issuing more common shares or selling bitcoin to raise the cash it needs to pay the dividends. Since Strategy’s first preferred offering, STRK, started trading on February 1st 2025, the stock is up +6%. In that same period, Strategy’s common stock, MSTR, has traded down -16.44%, signalling that investors like the potential yield and protection that the preferred offering provides. Importantly, Strategy’s common shares and preferred shares have both outperformed bitcoin and the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) since February 1st 2025, with spot bitcoin and IBIT being down -19% in the same period.

Title: Hong Kong’s leader takes swipe at Trump but avoids criticism of deal to sell Panama assets

Kanis Leung, Associated Press Kanis Leung, Associated Press Leave your feedback HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings’ in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong’s laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. In Beijing, when asked about reports that China authorities are investigating the potential sale, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities. WATCH: ‘We’re taking’ back the Panama Canal, Trump says “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” she said. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison’s operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.

Title: China, Hong Kong threaten to thwart sale of Panama Canal ports to America's BlackRock

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. A deal for the U.S. to "reclaim" the Panama Canal is increasingly under fire from authorities in China and Hong Kong. Earlier this month, BlackRock announced a $23 billion deal with CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, which are located at the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal, respectively. It would also take over Hutchinson’s controlling interest in 43 ports in 23 other countries. However, Hong Kong and Chinese leaders could seek to stand in the way. John Lee, the leader of Hong Kong, stated his concerns about the deal on Tuesday, saying it deserved "serious attention." The agreement between the two conglomerates was seen as a solution to President Donald Trump’s threats to take back the canal after he argued that China was using it to "rip off" U.S. ships through entry fees. DEM SEEKS TO HALT TRUMP FROM 'INVADING' GREENLAND, CANADA AND PANAMA CK Hutchison and BlackRock recently inked a deal to transfer ownership of the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo) Trump touted the BlackRock deal as the U.S. "reclaiming" the port when it was first announced. Now, Beijing has opened up investigations into potential antitrust and national security concerns about the deal through various agencies, including its State Administration of Market Regulation, Bloomberg reported. "If Beijing stops this deal, that’s a direct challenge to the president of the United States on an issue which he really cares about," said U.S.-China relations expert Gordon Chang. "That is not going to go down very well." The lucrative waterway sees 5% of global maritime trade pass through. CK Hutchison’s stock price fell 3% on Tuesday after Lee’s comments, and the company canceled press and investor briefings that were scheduled for this week when it releases its financial report. CHINA SLAMS TRUMP-IMPOSED ‘ARBITRARY TARIFFS,’ VOWS RETALIATION AGAINST US Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said the Panama deal "deserved serious attention." (REUTERS/Joyce Zhou) "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations," Lee had said in an apparent jab at Trump. Commentaries published in Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper owned by the Chinese government, claimed the Hutchison-BlackRock agreement would allow the U.S. to "use [the canal] for political purposes and promote its own political agenda" and would make Chinese trade and shipping "subject to the United States." CK Hutchison is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Lee has said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong law, and the city will handle the deal according to law. "I suspect that the Hong Kong government is not going to take on Li Ka Shing and Hutchison, but you never know because the environment in Hong Kong is changing. It's not getting better," said Chang. PANAMA PLEDGES TO END KEY CANAL DEAL WITH CHINA, WORK WITH US AFTER RUBIO VISIT Some 5% of global maritime trade passes through the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) China’s presence in the canal zone allows it to block U.S. access at will. That could mean in the outbreak of war in the Indo-Pacific, it could prevent the U.S. Navy from surging ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the canal. However, the canal could also be used as leverage for China in its push for Trump to alleviate tariffs. Trump said Monday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be visiting the U.S. in the "not too distant future." Trump at first put a blanket 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. In March, he upped it to 20%, arguing China was still not doing enough to address fentanyl flowing from its country through U.S. borders. CK Hutchison’s ownership of the canal also faces a constitutional challenge in Panama, which could be a factor in its intent to sell. Panamanian Attorney General Kenia Isolda Porcell Díaz has filed a submission in support of two lawsuits against renewal of a 25-year contract for Hutchison to own the ports, arguing the contract is "unconstitutional" because it "improperly agree[s] to transfer exclusive rights of the Panamanian State." When asked about the reports that China was investigating the sale, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the questions should be directed at other agencies.

Title: JD Vance: Cheap Labor Is Bad for U.S. Productivity, Innovation, Society
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/03/18/jd-vance-cheap-labor-is-bad-for-u-s-productivity-innovation-society/
Time Published: 2025-03-18T17:59:37Z
Full Content:
The lure of cheap labor is bad for innovation, productivity, civic solidarity, and national strength, Vice President JD Vance told business leaders at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vance told his audience of investors, adding: Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor,” Vance said in a short speech. The statement shows how Vance is trying to repair the political bridge between the party’s voters and business leaders that was deliberately demolished by ruthless pro-migration policies pushed by the two Bush presidencies. The two Bush presidencies dramatically expanded legal and illegal migration to inflate the stock market with cheap labor, more consumers, and more renters. “There were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization,” Vance said: The first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea was that rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things. You would open an iPhone box and it would say “Designed in Cupertino, California.” Now the implication, of course, is that it would be manufactured [in China] or somewhere else. And yeah, some people might lose their jobs in manufacturing, and they could learn to design, or to use a very popular phrase, and “learn to code.” But I think we got it wrong. Turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects, as you all well understand, the firms that design products work with firms that manufacture. They share intellectual property, they share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end [so] we were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization. I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it’s a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it’s a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now, if you can make a product more cheaply, it’s far too easy to do that rather than to innovate. And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald’s means more [service] kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I’m not going to comment on that here … [we think] companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing. I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You’re worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day. And so I’d ask my friends, both on the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I’d say that globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation. Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. … Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders — in our own businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation. We don’t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation, and how tight labor markets and rising wages pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. For example, the Fortune 500 has increasingly imported foreign white-collar labor to cut costs. But the programs created by Congress and the executive — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. In 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that President Joe Biden’s migration policy would reduce productivity growth in the United States. Vance told his listeners that elites’ demand for cheap labor also fractures societies: I think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they compare it to what’s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from their sense of solidarity. You see the alienation of people from their sense of purpose. And importantly, they see a leadership class that believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can replace a sense of purpose. … Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was in — in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to some of the leaders of — of the important technology firms of the United States … And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that — you know, CEO — you would know his name if I mentioned it. He was the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. He said, “Well, I’m actually not worried about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.” And I said, “Okay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of purpose?” And he said, “Digital, fully immersive gaming.” The same economic and civic problem has occurred in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where national leaders are inflating the economy with immigrants, dragging down average income and prosperity. For example, immigration forces nations to divert investment to housing and consumerism and away from factory automation and high-tech research. The economic damage has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.

Exchange operator Nasdaq said Tuesday it would open a regional headquarters in Texas, deepening its presence in a state that is fast emerging as a major financial hub rivaling New York. Elon Musk-led Tesla and SpaceX, as well as tech giants Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, have all moved to the Lone Star State, attracted by a favorable tax climate, lower costs of living and reduced energy costs. For Nasdaq, the move could also help it better compete with the New York Stock Exchange — which last month committed to launching an exchange in the state — and the Texas Stock Exchange, a venture backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, which is gearing up for a launch early next year. “It should be no surprise that there’s so much interest in bringing the capital markets to Texas… We’re proud to be leading the way in cementing Dallas as the financial capital of the world,” a spokesperson for the Texas Stock Exchange’s parent company, TXSE, said. Nasdaq did not specify its hiring plans for the new headquarters in Dallas. However, it pledged additional investments to support its “broad range of clients in the region.” A foothold in Texas could enhance the exchange’s reach among the state’s leading industries, including energy and manufacturing. However, some observers remain cautious, indicating that they need a clearer roadmap to gauge the move’s potential. “The opening of the regional office is more symbolic than substantive,” said Ross Carmel, partner at securities law firm Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel. Nasdaq lists over 200 Texas-based companies, with a combined market capitalization of $1.98 trillion as of December. The state also accounts for the largest number of listings on the NYSE.

Title: Larry Fink Reminds Leadership About That Other Retirement Crisis

ByMichael Peregrine ByMichael Peregrine , Senior Contributor. There are growing concerns as to whether Americans have enough savings for retirement. Most consumers are focused on the retirement crisis that has been sharing them right in the face as of late: the dramatic swings in the financial markets that have led to insecurity over individual savings plans, and eroding credibility in the economy and in the viability of Social Security. That retirement crisis, just about everyone gets. But in the midst of this Larry Fink, the influential chairman of the investment management firm BlackRock, is reminding corporate leaders of the potential for a different, less familiar, more long term crisis. It’s the tremendous strain confronting the U.S. retirement system ‒ and the unpreparedness of many employees and retirees for their financial security. And it’s a strain that corporate leaders may have a role in easing. Fink’s perspective is that only those employees of Fortune 500-type companies are truly supported by satisfactory retirement planning, which is an unsustainable social circumstance. In a recent interview with CNN, he ascribed much of the current anxiety in the nation to the fear of retirement. “We see less mobility in America because people have to stay closer to their family because of inadequacy of savings.” This concern for broad-based retirement security is grounded in both a recognition that people are living longer lives (which requires greater financial security) and in a firm belief that investment through the capital markets can provide that greater security. As Fink noted in his most recent letter to BlackRock investors, “We focus a tremendous amount of energy on helping people live longer lives. But not even a fraction of that effort is spent helping people afford those extra years.” To address this challenge, Fink proposes “an organized, high level” national conversation to help ensure that future generations are able to live out their senior years in a dignified manner. This conversation would examine the retirement crisis through three different perspectives: (i) That of a current worker, trying to save for retirement; (ii) Someone who has already retired and has savings, but is worried that the funds may run out; and (iii) the demographic concern ‒ what’s the issue for the population as a whole? To kick-start the “national conversation”, Fink calls on companies and their leadership to assume a greater role in helping workers confront retirement. That might include providing some level of matching funds for retirement plans, offering more financial education on plan contributions, and helping workers to transfer their 401(k) savings when they change jobs. Themes such as “affording older age” and “building retirement savings” for workers may more readily resonate with corporate leaders than themes of sustainability and social engineering. To be sure, this isn’t the first time Fink has raised concerns about a retirement crisis. In both his 2019 and 2024 letters to CEOs and investors, he called on companies to re-establish their traditional leadership role in helping workers navigate retirement. He warned that the failure to address the retirement crisis will leave far too many workers unprepared for retirement, eroding the country’s financial security. But the timing of his current warning may be propitious. The recent, broad-based concern with the security of retirement savings may be an appropriate time to refocus attention on the current system of worker retirement. And it might be a particularly appealing message for corporate leaders who are searching for ways to address growing economic anxieties within their workforce. Fink worries that the retirement message that companies and business send to workers shouldn’t be “you’re on your own.” Business leaders have an opportunity (if not an obligation) to change that message, by applying their expertise and innovative spirit towards solving this “other” retirement crisis.

Title: Orion Security emerges from stealth using LLMs to track your enterprise’s data flow and stop it from leaking out

Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More If you pay attention at all to cybersecurity news, there’s a strong chance you’ve heard scary reports of firms hiring remote contractors that turn out to be hackers or North Korean spies making off with sensitive, proprietary data. But even without that cloak-and-dagger, international espionage veneer, the truth is that all organizations have reasons to be concerned about their data security and the prospect of “exfiltration,” or the movement of data without authorization. IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that incidents involving data exfiltration are now on the rise extortion now average around $5.21 million per incident. In an age when data has never been more important or valuable to an organization — yet is also moving around between siloes more than ever before — how can enterprises best protect their sensitive information without breaking the bank? A new firm, Orion Security, believes generative AI large language models are the key. Today, the company announced its emergence from stealth with $6 million in seed funding led by Pico Partners and FXP, with participation from Underscore VC and prominent cybersecurity leaders, such as the founders of Perimeter 81 and the CISO of Elastic. Orion Security, founded by Nitay Milner (CEO) and Yonatan Kreiner (CTO), is already working with leading technology companies to help them safeguard sensitive business data from insider threats, according to an interview VentureBeat conducted with Milner over video call last week. “I spent a lot of years as a product leader in several companies solving very complicated challenges around observability and security in cloud environments, helping T-Mobile and BlackRock to get ahold of, and better understand, their very complex system stacks,” Milner said. “I experienced firsthand that the main problem in data security is understanding the business context of how sensitive data is being used in a company.” Unlike traditional data protection tools that rely on rigid rules and manual policies, Orion Security’s platform dynamically learns and maps an organization’s business processes. By understanding how data typically moves within an organization, Orion can distinguish between legitimate workflows and potential threats, whether intentional or accidental. “Orion revolutionizes data protection by understanding business processes and data flows in the company and automating data loss prevention with the power of AI,” Milner explains. This approach is a departure from conventional manual policy-based security models, which Milner believes are fundamentally flawed. “Most security solutions rely on manual policies, but policies don’t scale. There are new applications and workflows that make them obsolete pretty often.” He further emphasized how security teams struggle with outdated methods: “Security teams are stuck writing endless policies over and over again, getting hit by false positives, and still, data keeps leaking from enterprises. It’s a really bad situation.” Orion Security employs a combination of proprietary AI models and fine-tuned open-source LLMs to automate data protection. “All our AI is something that we developed… we’re not using a third party, like ChatGPT or something like that. We developed our AI internally, so it’s all our IP,” he told VentureBeat. The platform relies on two core models: one for classification, which identifies how sensitive data is based on context, and another for business reasoning, which assesses user roles, workflows, and typical data movement to detect anomalies. Orion’s AI is further fine-tuned on industry-specific and organization-specific data to improve accuracy, ensuring it adapts to each company’s unique operations. While they leverage fine-tuned open-source LLMs, Milner notes their surprising effectiveness even without extensive pre-training, saying, “LLMs that are open source… have a lot of context, and you wouldn’t believe the level they give you just by throwing sensitive data on them.” The platform connects to an organization’s cloud services, browsers, and devices to map data flows comprehensively. At the core of its detection capabilities is its Indicators of Leakage (IOL) engine, which leverages proprietary reasoning models and large language model (LLM) classification to analyze data movement patterns. Key features include: Milner compares Orion’s approach to endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, but for data protection. “We act as an EDR for data—think of it like a CrowdStrike for your data. If something anomalous happens, we catch and prevent it in real-time, even if there wasn’t a predefined policy.” Beyond catching malicious insiders, Orion also distinguishes between human errors and external attackers. “The three main vectors for data leaks are malicious insiders, human errors, and external attackers. We detect and differentiate between all of them,” Milner says. Orion Security provides users with a dashboard-driven experience, offering real-time insights into business data flows. The interface categorizes risk by severity, allowing security teams to quickly identify and address high-risk activities. Some notable elements of Orion’s UI include: This intuitive approach to data security allows security teams to quickly assess potential threats and take immediate action when necessary. Milner described the platform’s visibility capabilities thusly: “Imagine having a dynamic map of all the sensitive data movement in your company—between people, devices, and applications—and making sure it doesn’t leave your organization.” Backing from cybersecurity veterans further reinforces Orion’s approach. Gil Zimmermann, Partner at FXP, who previously co-founded CloudLock (acquired by Cisco), sees Orion’s technology as a long-overdue evolution in data protection: “AI is creating a watershed moment for data protection, and Orion Security is at the forefront of this transformation,” he wrote in a prepared statement in a press release provided to VentureBeat. “Orion’s AI-powered approach solves the core challenges we faced for years — the lack of business context and overwhelming manual work. This is the future of data security we envisioned but which couldn’t be built a decade ago.” Beyond detection, Orion offers flexibility in response mechanisms, letting companies customize their approach. “Some companies want us to block data exfiltration in real-time, while others prefer just getting notifications or educating employees on security policies. We let them decide how aggressive the approach should be,” Milner said. Orion Security is already working with leading technology companies (confidential due to business agreements) and plans to further refine its AI models to stay ahead of evolving insider threats. The company’s onboarding process ensures customers see immediate value. “We take three months of historical data when onboarding a new customer, so our AI delivers value from day one,” Milner explains. Additionally, Orion emphasizes privacy-first security architecture. “We don’t store any sensitive data—only metadata. If a company prefers, they can even install our classifier in their own environment so nothing leaves their systems,” Milner says. With an AI-driven approach that reduces manual workload, false positives, and security blind spots, Orion Security is well-positioned to shape the next generation of context-aware data protection solutions.

Tokenized Treasury products of BlackRock-Securitize, Superstate and Centrifuge are poised to receive allocations from $1 billion investment plan initiated by Sky, formerly MakerDAO, an initiative designed to accelerate the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on Sky-adjacent decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Spark. BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize and backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, is set to receive $500 million allocation. Superstate's USTB will get a $300 million. Centrifuge's JTRSY, a T-bill fund in partnership with asset managers Anemoy and Janus Henderson, set to receive $200 million. The selection process saw 39 applicants evaluated by advisory firm Steakhouse Financial, a key player in Spark’s ecosystem specializing in RWAs. Winners were chosen based on criteria including liquidity and capital efficiency. The final allocations will be market-driven and capped at $1 billion, Spark said in a press release. Pending governance approval, the selected tokenized assets could be used as collateral for Sky’s native stablecoin USDS and its yield-bearing counterpart, sUSDS. The protocol's move is part of a larger trend of blockchain-based protocols integrating tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, or real-world assets, like bonds, funds and credit. In 2024, Sky announced plans to invest $1 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasury bills, attracting interest from a wide range of issuers.

Title: This ‘Unpatriotic’ Trade Nets You A 9.1% Dividend

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Closeup of an American flag in a row. Memorial day, Independence day, Veterans day, patriotic ... [+] concept. Copy space. For years, it’s been a struggle to try to convince many U.S. investors to spread some of their money abroad. It’s only natural: We simply tend to favor the familiar—our home country—over others. Investors the world over have this natural bias. But that’s been slowly changing in recent months. Which is great news, because diversifying internationally is a particularly smart move in times like these. Moreover, when you diversify—especially through 8%+ yielding income investments like closed-end funds—you can easily rebalance your holdings in line with changes in the market, moving more into U.S. stocks when they’re low, say, and international assets are high. And doing the reverse when that situation flips back. When it comes to recommending the U.S. over the rest of the world in recent years, it’s really just been a case of following the facts: The data simply tells us that U.S. stocks have been the best performers, as a mix of poor policy decisions and inefficient markets in Europe and Asia made those regions less compelling. The market performance really does speak for itself here, with the S&P 500 handily beating global indices over the long haul. We can see that very clearly when we look at the long-term performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in purple below, and the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US ETF (VEU), in orange, over the last decade. SPY Total Returns Lately, however, something quite different has been happening. In 2025, every stock market in the world has been moving up except for America’s. Journalists and bankers have taken notice; the Financial Times recently reported that this is shifting investors’ demand for assets: “Importantly, this seems to be generating real investor interest, with a lot of sell-side analysts recently mentioning how many questions they’re finally getting about Europe,” the FT recently wrote. Of course, stock-market volatility means that an asset (or collection of a country’s assets) might outperform in the short term but underperform in the long run. But this time, it is possible that foreign stocks, just as a sheer matter of reverting to the mean, could recover while American stocks slip further. This is why one of the best tools in an investor’s toolbox is diversification. It isn’t a matter of choosing either America or foreign stocks. It’s about having both and strategically buying more of one when it’s a better buy than the other. This is why we hold the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY) in the portfolio of our CEF Insider service. The fund mostly holds large cap international stocks like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), luxury-goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and German software firm SAP SE (SAP). The fund also generates an extra income stream by selling covered-call options on its portfolio. Under this approach, BGY sells investors the right to buy its stocks at a fixed price and time in the future. No matter what ultimately happens with these trades, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this right. In a Dec. 12, 2024, Contrarian Outlook article, I pointed out that it was an opportune time to add more BGY to your holdings with the following commentary: Since then, BGY has outperformed SPY by a significant margin. BGY Outperforms BGY is being driven by the overall momentum in international stocks, of course, even though it’s behind some of the higher-flying international ETFs out there. But we still prefer this fund, for two reasons: the dividend (current yield: 9.1%) and the discount, which points to the further “baked-in” price gains ahead. Let’s take that second point first. Unlike ETFs, which always trade very close to par value, CEFs can (and regularly do) trade at different values on the market in relation to their underlying portfolios—a measure called the discount to net asset value (NAV). That’s mainly because, unlike ETFs, CEFs tend to have a fixed share count for their entire lives. As I write this, BGY trades at a 7.8% discount. That means we’re getting international assets for cheaper than we would through an ETF. Plus, BGY’s discount has been much smaller in the past, when demand for foreign assets was higher, which means we won’t just get profits as BGY’s holdings appreciate in value. Those gains will also be compounded as market demand for international assets causes BGY’s discount to shrink. Indeed, that has already been happening at a slow pace over the last year. Secondly, the dividend. As mentioned, BGY yields 9.1%, which means the fund will give you a large portion of its profits in cash (I should point out that BGY pays dividends monthly, too). That means you can use that cash to rebalance into US stocks when they slide in value so that in the long term you get profits from both the short-term gains in foreign stocks and the long-term gains in U.S. stocks as they recover. And, of course, you always have the option to use the $76 per month you get for every $10,000 invested in BGY to do other things, like pay your bills. This scenario really does highlight many of the greatest things about CEFs: They allow you to diversify—making rebalancing easier in times of volatility and market stress—and give you a large cash stream you can use to be more financially independent. The topper? In the case of BGY, these benefits come our way at a nearly 8% discount, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/19 update below. This post was originally published on March 18 Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto. Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump’s White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “When there’s financial distress, they always print money. It doesn’t matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump’s on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession. 03/19 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is "between a rock and a hard place," Wells Fargo’s chief economist has told the Wall Street Journal, with the Fed likely to hold rates steady today as it grapples with the prospect of Donald Trump’s trade war fueling an inflation bump but also dampening economic growth. Traders are whispering that Powell could announce an end to the Fed’s balance sheet runoff program, known as quantitative tightening, which could boost the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets. “Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing quantitative tightening until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note seen by Coindesk. “They do not expect to restart after the debt ceiling is addressed, but the announcement won’t be made until later this year.” The Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s 2:30pm ET press conference. "Late last year, Fed chair Powell hinted that the end of [quantitative tightening] was coming in 2025. If he mentions it in [today’s statement or press conference (I imagine someone will ask him), that would end up signalling that we’re in a new monetary regime, and that the Fed stands ready to resume additional debt purchases should [quantitative easing] become necessary again," Noelle Acheson, editor of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, wrote in an emailed note. "While renewed [quantitative easing] is unlikely any time soon, the additional liquidity from a large buyer (the Fed) coming back into the market to replace maturing holdings would be good news," Acheson wrote, adding the Treasury market is facing $9 trillion in debt maturity this year that quantitative tightening could disrupt. "When the floodgates open, it’s go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they’re going to reflate and print more money than anyone’s ever printed before.” The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing. “We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said. Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious “All eyes are on the Federal Reserve policy meeting this week,” BlackRock analysts wrote in a note. The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed’s latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump’s campaign to see them brought down. Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell’s all-important, post-decision press conference.

Title: China says Panama ports sale to BlackRock is an example of ‘economic coercion.’ Investors are spooked | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong spoke out Tuesday against a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to a consortium led by BlackRock, sending shares in the Hong Kong-based conglomerate that owns the ports plummeting. It’s unclear how regulators could interfere with the plan, which was announced earlier this month, given that the ports that CK Hutchison intends to offload to the group led by the US investment giant are located outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. However, observers have said Beijing’s sharp criticism of the deal means it may not ultimately go through. When asked at a regular press conference whether China was investigating CK Hutchison’s planned sale, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, declined to answer directly. But she made Beijing’s view clear. “I would like to emphasize that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” she said. Her comments echoed those of John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader, who earlier on Tuesday said: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations.” On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that several Chinese government agencies, including the top market regulator, had been instructed by state leaders to study the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. CNN has reached out to CK Hutchison for comment. Its shares fell as much as 5% Tuesday due to jitters about the future of the proposal, which is currently an “agreement in principle.” Earlier this month, the group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the Panama Canal from CK Hutchison, as well as its controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a special arrangement with Beijing, which granted the city autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms unavailable in mainland China. But a national security law that came into effect in 2020 has transformed Hong Kong’s political, legal and business landscape. CNN’s Fred He and Chris Lau contributed reporting.

Over my pay grade but…..Erdogan has been all hat, no cattle in terms of brave words in support of the Palestinians not matched by action. He supported HTS in Syria mainly to teach Assad a lesson and to get him to Do Something about Syrian refugees in Turkiye, as in take a lot back. The plan, or at least his plan, was not to topple Assad. This action would be a massive double-crossing of Erdogan by Israel, since Turkiye has stood pat as Israel has chewed up Syria. An expulsion into Syria would lead to a new refugee influx into the much less bad off Turkiye. But Turkiye has been too chicken-shit to cross the US.

From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Note much of the press is not clearly reporting that the Houthis had stopped attacks while the ceasefire was on and merely said they’d resume them if the ceasefire failed and food was not let in, ie, the Trump strikes were pre-emptive.

Alex Christoforou pointed out in his latest video that this power plant is actually in Zaporizhzhia Oblast which voted and did join the Russian Federation. The Russian Constitution will not allow Putin to sell it off or give it away to Trump as it is Russian territory. I could see Putin offering to sell electricity generated there to the Ukraine as much as their electrical grid is ash right now however. So either Trump is just spouting his latest bs lines or he thinks constitutions are just like contracts – always up for renegotiation – and expects Putin to get in line. High hopes. Trump will give Russia Crimea because Tennyson! \sarc\ Trump will get back Donbass, while giving them the last Kursk “pocket”. \sarc\ Russia will offer to negotiate the shape of the table in Paris starting next December. \sarc\ Ukraine has nearly gone through all 500 gifted ATACMS; got no advantage from them and wants 500 more to get no advantage.

They are non-agreement capable, the whole rotten lot: Blinken, Biden, Trump, Witkoff, Rubio When an Israeli spokesman appears on TV these days, I just switch myself off.

They are nothing but liars. Rapid Onset Political Enlightenment Tablet. A must read. …the newly minted digital variant of “public opinion” was rooted in the algorithms that determine how fads spread on social media, in which mass multiplied by speed equals momentum—speed being the key variable. The result was a fast-moving mirror world that necessarily privileges the opinions and beliefs of the self-appointed vanguard who control the machinery, and could therefore generate the velocity required to change the appearance of “what people believe” overnight… Every form of totalitarianism is unique….Soviet cynicism was a natural product of how the Soviets decided to rule, which was to demand absolute external compliance to party dictates in word and deed while at the same time allowing its subjects a separate space to think their own thoughts—provided that they never acted on those thoughts. The natural outcome of the Soviet system was compliance without belief… Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood. Musk may have paid twice as much as the next-highest bidder for Twitter, if such a bidder actually ever existed. Netanyahu’s decision to invade Rafah on May 6, 2024, was the culmination of two long and otherwise separate chains of events whose consequences will continue to reverberate throughout the Middle East, and also at home. Netanyahu had been promising to invade Rafah since February. The fact that he had not done so by May had become both a symbol of Israeli weakness and indecision in the face of a global onslaught of Jew-hatred, as well as the continuing solidity of the regional power structure established by Obama’s Iran deal. Too much to unpack without a re-reading and careful deconstruction. But, some items stand out. True enough there is a “new machinery” in place from when the days of Lipmann, and that each “form of totalitarianisms is unique,” but to say that “Musk is his own man” I think is false, just ask Bibi and those who control his military contracts, which may be the same group. As for “global onslaught of Jew-hatred,” it’s very wide, too wide a paint brush that the author uses. The images I saw this morning of 300 dead Palestinians make me hate the state of Israel, Christians, atheist, Buddhist, Taoist, Maoist, gays, lesbians, straights or any other designation you wish to make including Jews, that supports this indiscriminate bombing of women and children. Too bad Samuels’ derangement on Iran derails an otherwise interesting examination of “the blob” and its use of 21st Century communications technology to “manufacture consent.” Going to grab a cup and read. I hope it mentions that he Soviets were also telling the people that computer programs were making the govt and businesses more efficient by figuring out what needed to be manufactured, etc ! I personally was struck by the language around the COVID lockdowns. Being a “bad” thing, that is, foisted upon us by Obama’s “permission structure machine” or suchlike. Without going into a long and detailed breakdown, because it is far, far too early in the morning, and because there are other subjects I would much, much rather write an essay on at the moment. My OVERALL reaction to the piece is that the author a) tries too much to pretend that the media and propaganda environment of the 2010s and early 2020s was COMPLETELY AND RADICALLY DIFFERENT from the past, and b) asserts, more or less out of thin air, that it is now done, finished, kaputski. I’ve done a lot of reading, and watching, of Cold War-era propaganda, for my own edification – because I feel that you cannot study the Cold War era as a whole without so doing. What may be different, to some extent, between today and, say, the 1950s, is the structure of the media landscape through which propaganda is applied, as well as the attendant terminology. But the basic idea of constructing a cage around one’s public actions and statements, of enforcing endless re-pledging of fealty – dare I say, of allegiance – through both positive and negative reinforcement, of flooding the voters’ brains with easy to remember slogans that catch on like fads and have no rational basis in reality? I mean, been there, done that, many times? And I won’t even touch the whole “where, oh where has objective journalism disappeared off to with Russiagate” thing with a ten foot pole. Instead, I recommend a book – “Selling the Korean War”, by Steven Casey, and another one, “Second Front – Censorship and Propaganda in the 1991 Gulf War”, by John Macarthur. Snapshots in time of exactly how that sort of “objective journalism” was managed by the Powers That Be long, long before Axelrod and Obama were doing their tango. Yes, Wisner’s “Mighty Wurlitzer” got a digital upgrade. And Obama was born into Wizner’s “family”. In some ways very insightful, this is a “limited hang out.” Despite its length Samuels’ Rapid Onset article is worth a read because it lays out useful bits of the expansion of propaganda techniques in national politics. Obama and Axelrod certainly deserve lots of criticism, but because he wants to focus his story on them he misses enormously important context. Samuels makes zero mention of propaganda techniques prior to Axelrod, so he can portray him as a huge innovator. No mention of the long war of corporate/libertarian interests against hugely popular New Deal policies. No mention of the massively funded Koch type programs to push neoliberal Democrats, mainstream media, academics and the judiciary to support policies that had little electoral support. Zero mention of longstanding propaganda techniques such has heightening tribalism by reducing everything to good-versus-evil narratives that demonizing opponents. Zero mention of how this fueled the PMC takeover of the Democratic Party and the PMC’s complete abandonment of broad New Deal-type coalitions. In this context Obama and Axelrod weren’t driving major changes but were continuing ongoing shifts. And were doing a lousy job on the propaganda front, because they weren’t tapping into or solidifying any portion of the Democratic base, and weren’t directing the base’s anger at political opponents. Samuels mentions some political failures (healthcare) and ignores others (abortion, immigration, gutting antitrust) but these don’t fit his larger thesis that Obama and Axelrod were masters at creating support for policies voters didn’t really like. Because Samuels ignores the longer, bipartisan history of manipulative propaganda, and ignores the PMC issues, he misses that Trump gains are largely explained by his ability (however cynical) to tap into the electorate’s more populist concerns, why the Dems aggressively expunge anyone not totally dedicated to the interests of large donors. Samuels assumes that (but does not explain why) an Israeli-Saudi total victory over Iran and the Palestinians would be a wonderful thing. This leads to the perverse conclusion that Obama’s Iran deal had nothing to do with stabilizing an ugly Middle East and reducing the chance of wars that US voters had absolutely no interest in. Instead, Samuels insists that the Iran deal was a cyncical Obama ploy to reduce the power of Jews within the Democratic Party. Yes Israel/Iran issues are very complicated, and there are a range of plausible arguments on all sides, but Samuels falls into the exact same tribal/good-versus evil propaganda framing he is attacking Axelrod for. Zero mention of the enormous power of AIPAC type money on the Democratic Party, and zero mention that the huge growth of political donations might have had a bigger impact on imposing unwanted policies on the electorate than any of Axelrod’s campaign techniques. Thank you for taking the time to write this! Great comment. Per my mighty wurlitzer comment above, there’s been in place somewhere in the bowels of the Blob since at least when Keenan wrote his “Political Warfare” memo a sophisticated propaganda machine organized along the principles of Norbert Wiener’s “cybernetics”. Increasingly and particularly since Reagan this machine has been targeted domestically and it has always existed primarily in the service of capitalist oligarchic interests. We’re now seeing various factions taking form amongst erstwhile capitalist oligarchs as the inertia of the State is degraded by DOGE and Lawfare. Zionism appears to be heavier in one faction, but there may suddenly be many factions rather than our habitual two. There is a unique data person in the news recently involved in identifying many of the linkages and impacts of federal budgets and programs, like USAID and campaign finance. She goes by the name DataRepublican (small r), and here is an interview with her. I want to say thank you for your comment as well. I stopped reading as soon as Samuels starting talking about the Hamas ‘army’ attacking, killing, and raping Israelis in October 2023. Maybe the ‘permission structure’ has led me to false beliefs. But I thought many of the Israeli dead and injured were in fact from Israeli military (including IDF helicopters) action, not Hamas. At least, he didn’t mention Hamas’ reported beheading of infants. It seems to me that Samuels’ essay is every bit as much propaganda as the Obama/Axelrod form. As for Musk, I think that he has used Twitter, now X, as the platform to take the ‘permission structure’ to the next level. Not at all reassuring for our future. >Minnesota Republicans seek to codify ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ as mental illness It’s funnier than The Babylon Bee. Funny like “this meat smells funny”, or “we have a funny kind of democracy”. I guess if one is critical of Trump one can be committed to the “funny farm”. Good times. I suppose that there are two types of “funny.” There is funny funny and there is funny strange. Two different meanings. It’s all about context. I believe the saying goes “as in funny ha-ha or funny strange” I’ve heard both. The British version is funny ha-ha or funny peculiar, which is more sinister, more… Lovecraftian. “It’s a funny old world.” Yes. Not that I was a fan of “Thatcherism”, but it sure looks manageable from today’s perspective. I don’t know. One of my friends has a bad case of TDS. Throughout Biden’s term the guy was always mocking election deniers. When we were hanging out this weekend, he was telling me all about how Trump rigged the 2024 election. When I pointed out that I was not interested in his election denialism, a position he formerly mocked, he replied that this was different because there was evidence. I asked him about his “evidence.” Needless to say, it was a screed about how Elon has hackers and Trump said we “would never have to vote again” but drawn out into a five minute rant. I’m finding it less funny by the day. Funny how?! MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. OpenAI Says It’s “Over” If It Can’t Steal All Your Copyrighted Work – Futurism Fair use isn’t claiming the work and thoughts of others is some computer program “thinking”. These f’ers from A to Z (Altman to Zelensky) are out of ideas except asset-stripoing and looting. I refused Cambridge University Press permission to turn over my textbook to the AI things. They COULD very logically and easily conclude that the open access stuff by me is worth scraping instead. It would be a pity if I copied over all the main orthogonal main effects plans and balanced incomplete block designs to my public website with any “minor unintentional copy-paste mistakes” and these got scraped and thus shone like the beacons of Gondor in studies that used those ;-) I don’t find the framing of this very convincing. If training materials for AI are regarded as not being covered under fair use, the biggest beneficiaries would be publishers like Elsevier and Penguin as well as major IP holders like Disney. Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use.

Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. Yes and that’s the unfortunate price a lot of us paid to get our books published. Is it fair? No. I get on average GBP80 p.a. royalties for my textbook, all of which goes to my accountant since I am required to do a self-assessment for tax, for which my accountant charges around GBP80. But I never did this for the money. Flaw number one in your reasoning. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. Again, I didn’t do it for the money. I always knew I’d gain only a pittance. Let me give you some insights (which I’ve stated here before) as to the purpose of my textbook, which gives flaw number two. I, along with the two most esteemed academics in my field at the time (RIP both now) wrote this book not in the expectation that it’d become the “default textbook” in ANY course in ANY country in the world. Why would it not? Because it is absolutely antithetical to big companies who offer consultancy services in discrete choice modelling. If you’re an academic who wants the dosh, you’re probably going to want to stay sweet with such companies. Thus, do NOT recommend to students a book which “opens the black box” and tells them how to do all this stuff themselves. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use. See my point below. The whole point about discrete choice modelling is that you NEED statistical design matrices, which don’t stay up on the internet for long (for various reasons, but NOT for any copyright/legal infringements etc). If AI want to scrape my stuff they’re welcome. The stuff “owned” by CUP might not be scraped, and even if so, AI will struggle. Why? Because what I and colleagues did was NOT stuff on what economists call the “production possibilities frontier”. By definition it was work to move beyond this using well designed experiments that are NOT out there to “scrape”. As a final note, our book merely gives the reader all the statistical and survey method tools to do the types of discrete choice models we pioneered. I spent 5 years working hard in peace from funders before I got my “key paper” published. Then on EVERY single project since I have been employed I have tried to be humble in recognising that I have an equation with two unknowns and therefore potentially infinite solutions. The only way to hone in the likely correct one is to spend a LOT of time among a multi-disciplinary group including experts who “work at the coal face” to get an idea as to which is the REAL maximum in the maximum likelihood function. AI can’t give you that in any area beyond an incredibly narrow number of applications for which we already know the answer. I do not fear AI. Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. Furthermore I never did it for the cash, I did it (stupid and naive those this makes me sound) to enable followers to know the general “path” towards a solution. To GET a solution, they still must do a lot of HUMAN work. Since I’m the last remaining expert in my my field, with h-indices, and an Erdős number better than any health economist I’ve ever known (who didn’t get it purely by being someone I taught), I’m fairly sure my work will get scraped. This won’t help people, however and I’m relaxed. As a final note, if you want proof as to the shenanigans that go on in “academics versus business”, look up the edit history on wikipedia of the maxdiff model. When it stopped being an advert for a company and instead started being the definition of a long-standard mathematical model, that’s when I, under tutelage of one of my colleagues, began to put things right. Our “back and forth” with certain people ended when we got our book published and a certain wiki sub-editor who knew their stuff put a stop to editing by certain people for a while. “Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. The LLMs have provided a literal meaning to “thinking outside the box”. Yeah, trouble is what it actually is, is “making shit up” when they must think outside the box. One of my oldest undergrad friends works in AI at Google. He refuses to say exactly what he does. But he did quiz me a LOT 5-10 years ago about what I was doing in my research. I think (personally) he got the “idea” of what I did (moving beyond the PPF) but never really understood what AI needed to do to “really” think outside the box. Which has made me think AI is actually nowhere near genuine proper artificial intelligence. The “Google et al AI” is not thinking outside the box in the way a human would do AT ALL. It is still rooted in predictive algorithms. Its version of “intuition” is “just making shit up”. “Thinking outside the box” only has true meaning for humans. It really has no meaning for computer programs. yep! Schrödinger’s AI coming soon? :) Almost everybody is forgetting that computers are actually just very sophisticated adding machines. I’m also thinking the copyrights of others would be collateral for debt. This is not snark……I’m genuinely wondering…….maybe I’m being dumb but could you expand upon your point (without making a load of work for you!)? I don’t get your point :( I’m taking a leap of thought into a future where there are copyrights claimed that are not theirs. Right now they’ve managed to limit copyright filing to people. For now. ah thanks. I wonder what kinda “power levels” there are. Cambridge University (as a Federal institution) is a lot more powerful than it was in my day in the 1990s thanks to “Gates Business Park” etc. However, the Colleges own HUGE swathes of land, e,g, the entire port of Folkestone….. Wonder what a battle of the “land barons” vs the “new AI tech companies” would play out? I objected to the Cambridge IP land grab, when they stripped academics of absolute ownership of their patentable inventions (IIRC, they did not dispossess them of copyright because they needed the useful idiot arts faculty to vote for the patent changes) The late Ross Anderson at the Comp.Sci.Department and I worked up my idea to organise all academics to donate their IP to a company which would licence it back to them provided the Uni was not a co-owner or a sublicensee etc. It was going to be called “Non Placet Limited”, it does not please (what is said to vote against against a motion in the Senate)…. Good for you! A pity it didn’t work. As AI nurses reshape hospital care, human nurses are pushing back – Associated Press “The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses “as good as any doctor” could help deliver care in rural areas.” I want to see all the Kennedys and their ilk using AI nurses and doctors – without questioning the BS. Let it be tested on them. They eant it so badly. Be the guinea pig. I’m sure that before you used one of those AI nurses, that they would make you sign a waiver absolving them of any resulting bad incident up to and including death. And if you refused, then you can’t see that AI nurse. Can’t see a real doctor or nurse either though as that AI nurse replaced them and they no longer work their. Real doctors and nurses are for those who can afford them. Sounds about right “Up to 90% of arms, munitions destroyed in Kursk Region belong to NATO — Russian diplomat” To be expected. For months now Zelensky has thrown his best formations into Kursk to try to get a breakthrough but they have all been stopped cold. In addition, Zelensky was sending the last of his best equipment to Kursk as well up to and including Abram tanks. As this pocket started to shrink, I would have expected NATO to pump in any and all weaponry that they could scrounge to try to stop Kursk from collapsing altogether. Now that it is mostly over, I am not surprised to see huge stocks of NATO weaponry being picked up by the Russians. Makes you wonder though. Like with Afghanistan, will Trump demand that Russia hand back all that NATO weaponry or face sanctions? But I think that his teeth will grind when he sees all those tanks and weapons – especially American ones – on display in military museums in Moscow. I’m curious how much of that weaponry can be re-furbished and re-purposed by Russia for the battlefield. It would be hilarious to see an Abrams tank with a Russian flag rolling into Kharkov. Or an Aussie Bushmaster vehicle with the SMO markings used to storm Kherson. Kiev will sell parts and ammunition. Finding spare parts is a problem the western stuff breaks so often. The black market will work. Would be more hilarious to copy what the UK/EU countries do and take a tank or vehicle from one of those countries that was donated to the Ukraine & captured and park it outside their Embassy in Moscow. After all, turnaround is fair play. Some of them will be sent to Iran. Since the Iranians are masters of reverse engineering, they may be able to create new weapons for the Palestinian resistance. >>>Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time? of course. I don’t need the Guardian to tell me that. Reminds me of my, ostensibly “health-conscious,” cousin. She spends a fortune at Whole Foods….only to stock her pantry w/the Whole Foods-brand, organic versions of shelf-stable snacks, and plastic sippy pouches (high salt, high sugar, high industrial seed oils, low satiety). Of course, I’m never going to give her the “errr, aware you aware that….” lecture, lol. I’ve always wondered if those plastic applesauce-yogurt sippy-pouches are one of many sources of BPA, etc. I suppose you could make raw snacks out of babies, but public acceptance is probably improved by ultra-processing. Terrific antidotes today, thank you. Of course fox loves music! I have a PhD student who gives guitar concerts to moose at night in the field. They are quite appreciative and curious. Orpheus was real;^) moose – guitar fox – banjo elephant – piano cow – trombone David Samuels, Rapid Onset. Tablet. Important for its attempt to bury Obama rather than to praise him. This observation alone is worth the time you spend on the long essay: ‘The Obama Democratic Party (ODP) was a kind of balancing mechanism between the power and money of the Silicon Valley oligarchs and their New York bankers; the interests of bureaucratic and professional elites who shuttled between the banks and tech companies and the work of bureaucratic oversight; the ODP’s own sectarian constituencies, which were divided into racial and ethnic categories like “POC,” “MENA,” and “Latinx,” whose bizarre bureaucratic nomenclature signaled their inherent existence as top-down containers for the party’s new-age spoils system; and the world of billionaire-funded NGOs that provided foot-soldiers and enforcers for the party’s efforts at social transformation.’ Also important for Samuels’s own hobbyhorses and his failure to break new ground. To wit: –Obama did all of this more or less on his own, somehow? I don’t believe in the Great Man excuse for history. –Obama is a product of the Democratic Party, rather than leading an incursion from outside. So the Clintons are involved in here somewhere, eh? –The author seems to be much too convinced that his rubric is “airtight.” Yet the current war (and genocide) in Ukraine is a proxy war based on Western lies and very much on the unwillingness of the Russians to publicize much. The West is spilling secret information constantly, announcing its addled plans, and screaming its soon-to-be-made mistakes. The Russians don’t say much. The Russian concession to the digital world is to send out the wildly intelligent and witty Maria Zakharova – but she was invented by Jay Ward way back when as Natasha Fatal –The author slips on the “genocide in Gaza,” which he offers as a meme. What happened here is very interesting: The Palestinians were finally able to get the world to see them on social media. The exception that tests the rule? Or is Samuels’s too-clean structure a hollow figure made from pipe cleaners? See below in which Netanyahu becomes a savior. Oh. –David Axelrod as evil genius? –Elon Musk as one of three saviors? “Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood.” –And then the Holy Book of Netanyahu. Sheesh. –Obama may deserve revenge. This essay isn’t it. –And I’m Saint Joseph, the father of god (feastday tomorrow: Send adoration.) Yeah, it might have been a tad more palatable if the writer had used Obama Administration as the subject throughout the story instead of just Obama. Like Trump Administration should be used instead of Trump. Yup, he lost me once his priors on Covid, Musk, Israel and Iran took over what had been a ln interesting article with some valid observations. Still worth the read, but with critical thinking and a spoonful of informed skepticism. I thought this essay was brilliant, right up until this gem: “the idea that Iran was itself a formidable adversary—was a mess of lies. Iran was not and never was a regional power, capable of “balancing” traditional American allies. It was a totalitarian shit hole regime that is deeply hated by its own people and throughout the region, entirely dependent on American backing in its efforts to gain a nuclear bomb.” Frankly, the essay up to that point *is* briliant and it has given me a new way to think about Obama, about Musk/Twitter and about David Samuels…. I overlooked the Covid points because he isn’t necessarily wrong in writing about how the digital false consciousness manufactured “consent” to unreasonable measures (the relatives of the dying could have been FFP3 masked and allowed to visit and enforced to quarantine at properly ventilated and invigilated facilities rather than leave their loved ones to die alone…). Also… autistic traits and possibly ADHD are a superpower. You cannot manufacture consent with people who don’t give a shit about other’s feelings but really have to know THE FACTS. Could non-autistic Elon – say, Tim Cook or Larry Ellison – have bought twitter? This article is the high-blown answer to Armchair Warlord’s simple question: why is the twiiterverse of commentary on Ukraine from people with anime pictures in their bio’s (and no Ukraine flags) so much more right on all the big questions than MSM and the entire pllkitucsl class. Because they are immune at least in part to external voices, either because they hear only their own (autism) or they hear loads of others (ADHF, not stable internal monologue but a cacophany). The video of Katherine Franke (“police state watch”) explaining the extortion technique Trump uses when “negotiating” is a must watch. “Introduction of brownshirts” is now officially on my bingo card. I’m with you on the “Brownshirts” issue. It is the next logical step. We must also remember that the Brownshirts were part of a larger ecology of violent militias at the time. Who today remembers that the Communists also fought “in the streets” back then? It is also instructive to remember that most of the brawlers doing the fighting in the streets then were ex-military veterans of the Great War. All that is needed to make the analogy complete is for America to lose a decently sized war. “Beware the Ides of March — Are Trump and Netanyahu, Acting in Tandem, Committing Political Suicide?” It’s amazing in its own way. Trump has this huge agenda in how he wants to reshape America into his idea of what America should look like. Probably something like 1890s America – but without all that industry. Now after only two months, he is ready to jump into the Ukrainian rasputitsa at the instigation of the UK and France instead of just walking away. This could very easily now become Trump’s war. And if that wasn’t enough, it looks like at the instigation of Israel that he wants to get involved in a shooting war in the Middle east. For now it it is Yemen but he is already threatening Iran. That aborted attack on Iran last year should have shown him that that may not be so easily done. Trump probably think that in any room, that he is the smartest one there but that ain’t necessarily so. That would have to be a pretty small room, or one with only a handful of people in it. Trump Administration. The reality TV star isn’t thinking of all of this himself. – ‘The European Parliament Confirmed Poland’s Centrality To The Bloc’s Eastern Security Strategy’ – Andrew Korybko There are many important issues embedded in this article, as well as the others by Korybko that he cites in the text. I note two here. First, his “New Iron Curtain” terminology emphasizes a key point that isn’t discussed often enough in the face of Russia’s impending “defeat” of Ukraine. This is that the NUMBER ONE priority of this long-planned proxy war was to *sever the ties between Russia and Europe* that had been developing since the end of the Soviet Union. Atlanticist-oriented neocons have been writing about this since the 1990s. Their fear was not just the re-emergence of a Russia that might challenge US military supremacy someday, but the economic challenge of a Europe – especially Germany – reintegrated with Russia. The Nordstream pipeline was the ultimate symbol of this danger. Far from a “defeat” for the US/NATO alliance, in terms of severing these ties and building a “new Iron Curtain,” the Ukraine war has been an unqualified success. Mission accomplished! So much for “keeping Russia out and Germany down.” How about the “keeping America in” part? This is another area in which a lot of people seem to be celebrating a bit prematurely (with Yves and a few others being significant exceptions). Many commentators, even those critical of the US/NATO project like Korybko, simply assume that Trumpian “populism” has won in the US and we are getting out of Europe, leaving our poor European “allies” high and dry. Now they’ll have to defend themselves, while the US withdraws, perhaps to concentrate on warmongering with China or finishing our destruction of the Middle East. But there is a very powerful and bipartisan Atlanticist Establishment in the US. There are some factional disagreements, but they all — neoliberals; neoconservatives; the huge arms industry, its lobbyists, and Congressional lackeys: the national security apparatus: the Europhile liberal media/academia complex – all of them, have a massive material and/or ideological investment in the Atlanticist project. They’ve managed to capture (almost) all of the European political class. They spent 8 years carrying out war against Trump for this reason. Do people really think they are going to give up now? Are the “populists” now in control? Really? Lots of other issues suggested in this piece (e.g. the centrality of Poland in the New Cold War). But these two are the most striking to me. European Russophobia and Atlanticism are two sides of the same coin. Like Janus. And all those in the Trump Administration talking about the “stock market doesn’t matter’…. What are their short and put positions? “Vote crow next general election.” Never. Rook voter for life. Crow is fur eatin’, not votin’. https://fortune.com/2025/03/14/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-halt-owners-complain-of-metal-sides-falling-off/ Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off I’ll guess it’s 80% incompetence and 20% malice. (This is who programs are being cut for so that more govt money can go to his businesses?) https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-discovers-magic-money-computers-or-how-the-u-s-financial-system-actually-works-43a21350?mod=home_lead/ “….Going back to Musk, what he’s said to have found is that the government doesn’t track terribly well the money it spends — for example, not coding each payment for precisely what it’s going toward. He told Cruz that he attributes 80% of that sloppiness to incompetence and the other 20% to malice.” ‘Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off’ Very much looking forward to the day that their fronts fall off – and the comments that will flow from that. Beat me to it! To state the obvious, if you were actually interested in cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse” … seems I have been hearing that phrase for the last 60 or 70 years … the logical place to start is the so-called defense budget. It is the largest slush fund. But no, we must go after Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare as there are the largest pools of money that might be put into private hands so the greedy bastards can suck out as much as they can get away with. Since we have a government of, by, and for the rich, the fat cats, the plutocrats, the oligarchs, the looters … I cannot decide the most descriptive word for them … they must be allowed to belly up, elbowing their way in. Is the appropriate emotion here disgust or rage? Both at the same time? I receive Social Security and Medicare. I paid whatever taxes were required. And now some ginned up department fronted by a really rich guy wants to blow up long established programs that work reasonably well in the name of what the profit driven call efficiency? The definition of efficiency that fuels private equity? The definition that has seen so many businesses sucked dry until the husk resembles what remains when a spider has finished a meal. Welcome to the American Nightmare. Aljazeera repeating a lie by Marco Rubio, that the US “coordinated with Russia” on the Yemeni attacks. This sort of thing at the margin is not helpful to the US improving relations with Russia, let alone getting to any sort of big deal. From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Does that really qualify as total denial of Rubio’s claim? “Stressing the need for” and “totally objecting to” are different…IMO. First, the text was from the official Russian readout. It is vanishingly unlikely that it was issued to rebut Rubio. Second, “coordinated with Russia” = Russia participated in the planning. In reality, Rubio presented the US plan to Russia. Third, Russia objected to the attack by calling for diplomacy instead. So yes, Rubio lied. If the Russians leave any room for misinterpretation (or lies), it will be taken. I doubt Rubio cared one iota what the readout said. He had his story. No one reads readouts, including journos who ought to. You don’t seem to begin to get how offensive it is, and more important, disruptive to Russia’s relationships, to depict Russia as being on board with US shelling of Houthis when it absolutely is not. Rubio, the asshole he is, was probably relying on Lavrov not correcting Rubio publicly due to not wanting to sour the Trump-Putin phone call. Some poor Russian MF junior probably had to call all over the Middle East correcting the Rubio fabrications. I further do not understand why you defend America persisting in bad faith behavior. I don’t defend it. I just point it out. Basically, I’m not thinking anything has changed until I see it changed. Until Russia gets a security agreement that makes sense to them, it still seems like the plan to extend Russia is game on. “The Kingdom of Judea vs. The State of Israel” Just through demographics alone, I could very easily see a situation where secularists in Israel will become an oppressed minority but am not sure how that would work out as they pay nearly all the taxes, man nearly all the military and fill all the civil service jobs. So maybe a tolerated minority? The position of women would sink as the religious right would demand that all women leave the Israeli military and go back home to be out of sight and out of mind. You think that I am joking but when Hillary was SecState and went to Israel, a major religious publication airbrushed her and any other women out of the official photos taken. It is that weird and now these same people want to run the country. I don’t see an eventual Israeli civil war – maybe – but I can see a collapse of the State as professional Israelis will just bail out of the country. “Magnolias are so ancient they’re pollinated by beetles — because bees didn’t exist yet” This is an amazing story this and one that I would never have suspected. Magnolias were contemporary with the dinosaurs? And they are pollinated by beetles? Before bees I suppose that having beetles pollinate flowers was common but it looks like magnolias surviving all those time shows us the proof of this being so. So years ago we lived in Kentucky and often visited The Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill (https://shakervillageky.org/) outside of Lexington where I fell in love with Southern Magnolias, the big evergreens. I have been trying to grow a couple of supposedly cold-tolerant varieties here in central NY and two years ago (thanks to global warming?) I finally had a few big, waxy, lightly fragrant blossoms. And yes I noticed tiny black beetles in the flowers. I too am delighted to know more about their phylogeny. Magnolias are also pollinated by slugs. They and Old Dixie have a good PR team. Strange fruit…. Trump hypes up tensions with Iran Indian Punchline. Important Trump had shorter peacemaker stint than Obama. – ‘Every Administration Since Obama Has Been Bombing Yemen, Yet…’ – Ian Welsh (Micael T) – “Scott Ritter Should Be A Nobel Prize Winner…” It probably won’t shake my fundamental pessimism, but I’ve been struck by the very harsh criticism of Trump over the Yemen bombing by anti-war conservatives like Judge Napolitano and Larry Johnson. I saw Johnson on Nima’s Dialogue Works yesterday, and he really lit into Trump and defended AnsarAllah in terms very similar to Ian Welsh, as the only entity with the guts to stand up against the Israeli genocide. It does make you wonder what effect, if any, Trump’s apparent doubling-down on the MIGA project will have on his support. I guess we are seeing whose support is most important to him. What a world. See my Patrick Lawrence link below. And Gilbert Doctorow–who says he knew someone in Trump’s real estate operation–continues to defend Donald as an underappreciated if not totally stable genius. https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/03/18/why-alternative-media-are-down-on-trump/ If you ignore everything that comes out of Trump’s mouth and his all caps tweets then maybe that has weight, but personally I don’t believe a word of it. Lawrence says we may come to prefer Trump 1 to Trump 2. Trump is no genius but he is different from all the wonks. Fingers crossed that disaster doesn’t loom. Of course for Gazans it’s happening right now. I agree. The Lawrence piece is excellent as usual. And Doctorow misunderstands the Trump phenomenon in my opinion. About Trump’s “political skills” he says this: “One big factor in the underappreciation or miscomprehension of what Trump is doing comes from the underappreciation of his political skills. These skills should have been crystal clear from the very first days of his administration when he successfully pushed through the confirmation process ALL of his candidates for the top slots in his administration…” “Was this success in the confirmation votes just the result of the outstanding merits of the candidates and of their brilliant testimony in tough hearings? Of course not. It was the direct result of Trump’s marshalling his political skills, calling in chits, i.e. IOUs, issuing warnings of hell to pay in the next electoral cycle if he were to be defied.” Trump’s primary “political skill” is demagoguery – his ability to gain broad public support by pretending to be one of the “people” in opposition to “the elite.” This was made much easier by the entire Establishment joining together to oppose him, playing to his strengths. So Doctorow is not wrong in pointing to fear as Trump’s main weapon; most Republicans would not support him if they weren’t deathly afraid of how their constituents would view any opposition. But when it comes to his “titanic struggle with the Deep State” at home or abroad he is a rank amateur. As far as providing an improvement on foreign policy, he is guided by no principles or philosophy or real understanding that I can see. My prediction is that the Blob will be able to undermine any positive tendencies toward reducing tensions in Ukraine (see my above comment). And regarding Israel – Lawrence covers that well. Is this due to bribery? Blackmail? Some delusional belief in an “Abraham Accords” solution to the Middle East? Who knows. But I would better appreciate his ability to reduce Congress to sniveling sycophants if that actually lead to something positive. Unfortunately, I’m leaning more toward the disaster side right now. The video about the Federal negotiations with Columbia strikes me as an example of Trump being able to count, although here not votes but cashflow. The tactic of putting your counterparty’s financial balls in a vice until they sign your deal is scorched earth negotiation 101, i.e. pure NY real estate. He has no third term and he has no afterlife unless he permanently remakes America to be safe for Trumps (and thus his “allies”)…. One of the features of Western politics over the last decade has been the collapse of the traditional left/right paradigm. Pronouncing someone a left winger or right winger is no longer a reliable guide to what they think. I’m trying to stop using the terms all together, although after decades of use it’s hard to stop. Not only are right wingers hewing to positions that I would have formerly associated with the left (anti-war, respect for treaties and other nations, reverence for human life), but we have also seen nominally left people and parties abandoning traditional left positions in favor of performative activities so they can pile on to Trump and others, and so they can support the increasingly useless and center-right Democratic party. I don’t know if this change is exactly a bad thing, but it does mean you have to examine people and positions on a case-by-case basis. Johnson and Napolitano are good examples of people who don’t conveniently fit into any kind of pre-existing mold. I’m very glad to see this criticism. It has been disturbing to watch people like Taibbi and Greenwald, both of whom I’ve followed for a couple decades or so now, be tarred as “conservative mouthpieces” in recent years for being critical of Biden, when they have been very consistent in their criticisms of those in power over the years no matter who is president. It’s been much more recently that I started following Judge Napolitano and the guests that frequent his and other similar podcasts. They were also highly critical of Biden and hopeful that Trump would be an improvement. I’m heartened to see that they are sticking to their principles too – and it reassures me that I’ve been listening to the right people. On a related note, Greenwald had a good show yesterday, talking about Trump defying the courts, and reminding us that he is far from the first to do so and is following in the footsteps other recent administrations – https://rumble.com/v6qso9y-system-update-show-424.html I agree Greenwald also had an excellent show today, playing lots of clips of Trump campaigning as the peace president” — to cheering crowds — and excoriating him for the bombing of Yemen. MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. My apologies if this has been posted. I did a search and couldn’t find it previously posted. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/musk-s-doge-team-sends-private-equity-veterans-to-social-security-agency Musk Taps Private Equity Veterans to Aid DOGE at Social Security Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has sent three individuals with experience in private equity and finance to the Social Security Administration, highlighting the focus that President Donald Trump is putting on rooting out waste and fraud in the nation’s social insurance programs. Among those tapped for the task are Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners, who also served on the board of Tesla Inc. and was an early investor in SpaceX — two of Musk’s companies — as well as Scott Coulter, formerly of Lone Pine Capital, and Michael Russo, formerly of Shift4, according to people familiar with the moves who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them. And the looting continues. ‘”Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them. The sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement emailed Monday.’ And I got a bridge… https://www.axios.com/2025/03/17/social-security-trump-doge Proposal would force millions to file Social Security claims in person The agency acknowledges the change could cause particular hardship for elderly and disabled Americans who have limited mobility. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/17/social-security-changes-phone-claims-doge/?utm_campaign=wp_todays_headlines&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F41a6931%2F67d94427c7d02e5122238ac4%2F596a5df2ade4e20ee37172da%2F18%2F61%2F67d94427c7d02e5122238ac4 in late 2023 I contacted Social Security and advised them that I wanted a crack at my forced annuity, and they duly set up a phone conversation with a SS agent, and I think there has been quite a bit of fraud because they asked me a whole bunch of questions that no ersatz Wukchumni could have answered, I was half surprised they didn’t ask who the catcher was on my 1974 little league team. A friend who decided to take his SS payments when he was 66 about 6 years ago, was told there must be a mistake-as he’d been getting payments since he hit 62, or I should say somebody else was, unbeknownst to him. Interesting anecdotes. Multiple questions are SOP in both the private and public sectors. They’re being careful. It doesn’t necessarily indicate there’s been “quite a bit” of fraud, whatever that may mean. The Social Security Adminstration indicates there’s been very little fraud, but I suspect that may not mean much to you. So, this proposal is justified? DOGE isn’t interested in fraud. It hasn’t provided any evidence, to my knowledge, of Social Security fraud after Elon and Trump claims (lies) re millions of dead people getting SS. Yet they keep repeating it. DOGE wants to break things so agencies will function poorly, thus justifying eliminating them. When was the last time you were asked what high school you went to and the year of graduation? That was one of the questions, they were playing for keeps~ Safeguards are needed, SSA is using those safeguards, and I’d think they help to prevent fraud. Why do you think they ask them? You said a fraudulent Wukchumi could not have answered those questions. In fact, if they’re being used, and work, there would be a low amount of fraud. I used to get irritated when asked security questions but quickly realized they were helping to protect my interests. And, I know many people who receive Social Security and none have had any fraudulent issues like your friend. So, I suspect that may be a rarity. We’re supposed to trust the richest guy on the planet who thinks Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, is obviously ideologically opposed to it, to ferret out fraud? Pretty much my experience as well. I refuse to sign up for “id.me” or now I guess it’s “login.gov”. VA and IRS want me to use “login.gov” as well, so I guess my online accounts with them will go stale.

Re: Trump and Putin Talk (per the Grauniad): «18 min. ago. The Kremlin’s readout (in Russian) said Trump put forward “a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days”. Meanwhile the White House readout said The Kremlin has continually claimed, falsely, that it has never attacked power plants used to generate electricity for civilians. For instance, following last month’s bilateral talks in Riyadh, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: We clarified [to the US] that we have never threatened systems supplying power to civilians, and that only the sites directly supplying the Ukrainian armed forces have been our targets. [The Grauniad editorializes:] But repeated attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been a key element of Russia’s war effort. … » Devil’s Own Advocate… I get the feeling that a role reversal is in order and we Golden Billionaires are gonna be pauperazzi soon.

But where do we end up going, certainly not to ex-Golden Billionaire haunts? re: Taibbi vs. elite academia Does anyone happen to have read Taibbi´s latest text on hgher education and double standard (as I suspect)? And could briefly summarize the points in it? The Angst of the Well-Endowed One enormous facet of the education controversy remains ignored Matt Taibbi From Thomas Edsall in the New York Times this morning: Marc Andreessen, a billionaire venture capitalist, cryptocurrency investor and pivotal but unofficial adviser to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, made the case in a recent interview that the entire system of American higher education should be shuttered and abandoned… The American university system commands worldwide respect. What would prompt a call for its abolition? At Johns Hopkins, the loss of $800 million in U.S.A.I.D. grants has forced the school to lay off 2,200 foreign and domestic workers… The Trump administration announced that it was cutting $400 million in grants to Columbia University “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Twenty years ago, maybe even ten, I’d have found these stories about Elon Von Hitler-Musk detonating thousands of campus-related jobs horrifying. But the education sob stories now flying off the presses are a Burj Khalifa of “needs context.” A gigantic lie of omission is a constant feature of these stories: p.s. I had been argueing along this line. Of course this has been an issue in US educationa for a very long time. So none of it makes the Trump peoples´ current rampage in any way more honest. But to quote Craig Murray´s latest text, it´s the “rot of democracy”. Only where the foundation already was corrupt any of this could be pulled off. In Germany we had a very sad Tuesday. I did intend a comment on that which was however littered with curse words and I luckily fell asleep. So I will spare you that. The decision on the war budget passed with 513 votes. 489 were necessary – 203 voted against. There were none abstaining. FDP wants to go to court over this. Why? Pure lip service. Everyone should know the Constitutional Court is – fucking – w.o.r.t.h.l.e.s.s. Among CDU, GREENS, SPD there were 3 (!!!!) who voted against: Martin Diedenhofen (SPD), Mario Czaja (CDU) Canan Bayram (GREENS) Now that´s real democracy. p.s. Mrs. and Mr. Clinton visiting Berlin.

Die sogenannten ‘Demokraten’!” And five years later the same sort of people were saying that may the hand of the person signing the armistice wither. Well as far as that is concerned I have come to be thankful for the – I never expected to say this until a few years ago – Russian nuclear and non-nuclear deterrents. i.e. the parallels to 1914 end with the vote for war budget. In fact: Russians have to fight so we don´t have to. Foreign Policy has a new piece on the Oreshnik.

China and Hong Kong condemn ‘bullying’ following deal struck amid US pressure. China is scrutinising a deal struck by a Hong Kong company to sell ports at the Panama Canal to a United States financial firm. Beijing directed multiple agencies on Tuesday to examine the transaction, according to Bloomberg News. The deal was earlier hailed by President Donald Trump, who has accused China of seeking to control the strategic waterway. Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business worth $22.8bn, including assets near the Panama Canal, to a group led by US-based investment company BlackRock. A week after the announcement, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentaries, calling the sale a betrayal of China that neglected national interests. The deal, which is yet to be sealed, is now being investigated for security risks and antitrust violations on the orders of senior Chinese leaders, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities about the report. “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” the spokesperson said. Those words reflected earlier comments from Hong Kong’s leader John Lee. “[The Hong Kong] government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” Lee told reporters. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Hutchison did not immediately respond to the reports of scrutiny by Beijing. The company has previously said the deal is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports”. The firm agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement. While the deal has not yet been finalised, it was not immediately clear what levers, if any, China could pull to block the deal, given the business that Hutchison is selling is based outside China and Hong Kong, and it is itself based in the Cayman Islands. Trump has previously called for the Panama Canal to be removed from “Chinese control”. Numerous US politicians have criticised Hutchison’s operations at the Panama Canal as a security risk.

Title: Bitcoin Storm Could Be Brewing, Crypto OnChain Options Platform Derive Says

The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive. Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve. With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive. "BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today," Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. “Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%)," Forster added. Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction. According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including "a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration." Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date. Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher. Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock. "Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don’t point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut," BlackRock said in a weekly note. The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

March 18, 2025 01:45 ET | Source: Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical Obtains Convertible Financing of EUR 4.0 Million from Major Shareholders and Committed Share Subscription Facility of up to EUR 60 Million from GEM Ghent, Belgium – 18 March 2025 – Sequana Medical NV (Euronext Brussels: SEQUA) (the "Company" or "Sequana Medical"), a pioneer in the treatment of fluid overload in liver disease, heart failure and cancer, announces today that it has secured significant additional financing through (i) the granting of a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan of EUR 4.0 million (the "2025 Convertible Loan") by certain of its major shareholders, namely Partners in Equity V B.V. ("Partners in Equity") and EQT Health Economics 3 Coöperatief U.A. ("EQT"), and (ii) the entering into a share subscription facility agreement (the "Facility") with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS ("GEM") for up to EUR 20 million in cash (with Sequana Medical's option to increase the commitment to up to EUR 60 million in cash, once the aforementioned EUR 20 million has been drawn down) (the "Capital Commitment"). GEM is a USD 3.4 billion, Luxembourg based alternative investment group with offices in Paris, New York, and Bahamas. Pursuant to the Facility, GEM agreed to commit, subject to certain conditions, an amount up to the aforementioned Capital Commitment, within a maximum term of three years in exchange for new ordinary shares in Sequana Medical and subject to certain share lending arrangements being in place. These financing arrangements are expected to extend the Company's cash runway to the end of 2025 based on expected drawdowns of the initial EUR 20 million Capital Commitment under the Facility. In addition, the Company agreed with its existing debt providers to restructure several features of the Company's debt, subject to certain conditions and as further described below. Ian Crosbie, Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical, commented: "2025 is a landmark year for Sequana Medical with the US commercial launch of the alfapump® planned for mid-Q3, following the FDA approval of our PMA for this breakthrough device in December 2024. We are very pleased with the strong feedback we have received from US hepatologists who are eager to offer the alfapump® to their patients, and the potential that it offers to virtually eliminate the need for therapeutic paracentesis and transform their quality of life. Through this financing package, we have the platform to demonstrate the clear market opportunity for alfapump®, and our ability to effectively access this through our small specialty commercial team targeting US liver transplant centers. We are delighted with the continued strong support from our key shareholders and lenders, as well as the new equity commitment from GEM." About the unsecured investor financing of EUR 4.0 million Under the 2025 Convertible Loan, Partners in Equity and EQT will grant a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan to the Company for an initial aggregate principal amount of EUR 4.0 million. In addition to the new EUR 4.0 million loan, any amounts owed by the Company to Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders under the convertible loan agreement entered into on 30 September 2024 between, among others, the Company as borrower and Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders (the "2024 Convertible Loan Agreement") will be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan together with, in accordance with the provisions of the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement, a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts. Further, the other lenders under the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement (the "Remaining 2024 CLA Lenders") will have the option to also accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan within 10 business days from the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In case a Remaining 2024 CLA Lender elects to accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan, any amounts owed to such Remaining 2024 CLA Lender plus a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts shall thus be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. Any lender under the 2025 Convertible Loan may also at any time increase the amount of loan provided by it thereunder, up to an aggregate principal amount of new money under the 2025 Convertible Loan of EUR 14 million (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any amounts rolled over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement (as described above) and excluding any interest compounded as from the date falling one business day after the date of 2025 Convertible Loan). The principal amount and interest of the 2025 Convertible Loan can be converted (in whole or in part) by the lenders for new shares of the Company at any time before the 2025 Convertible Loan has been repaid, converted or settled, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average trading price per share of the Company's shares traded on Euronext Brussels during the period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day before the date on which the Company has received the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%, and (ii) the issue price of the new shares issued by the Company at the occasion of the most recent future equity financing before receipt of the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%. A lender, however, cannot acquire more than 29.9% of the outstanding issued shares of the Company through an equity conversion. If the Company enters into a new (subordinated) convertible loan which includes conversion or settlement rights equivalent to those under the 2025 Convertible Loan, each lender will be entitled to convert its 2025 Convertible Loan (in whole or in part) plus a conversion fee of 33% of all amounts owed under the 2025 Convertible Loan into the new (subordinated) convertible loan. In addition, subject to certain conditions, following the hive-down of the DSR® business into a separate entity set-up by the Company ("DSRCo") (which hive-down has already taken place) and in the event of a hive-down of the alfapump® business into a separate entity to be set-up by the Company ("LiverCo"), if the Company obtains a potential equity investment or a convertible or exchangeable debt investment into LiverCo or DSRCo for an amount of at least EUR 15 million and EUR 7.5 million respectively (a "Hive-Down Future Investment"), each lender will have the possibility to have its loan repaid (in whole or in part) by means of a payment in kind, consisting of a transfer by the Company to the relevant lender of shares issued or to be issued by LiverCo or by DSRCo. The number of LiverCo or DSRCo shares to be transferred will be equal to (i) the relevant portion of the 2025 Convertible Loan to repaid in kind (in principal and interest), divided by (ii) the issue price of the new shares which are or will be issued by LiverCo or DSRCo at the occasion of the potential Hive-Down Future Investment, minus a discount of 25%. Unless the 2025 Convertible Loan has been converted or repaid in kind as aforementioned, the respective loans of each lender will need to be repaid in cash in case of default or upon request subject to prior notice, provided, however, that a repayment request may only occur on or after the later of: (A) (x) the date falling one year after the date on which the hive-down of the alfapump® business and the respective Hive-Down Future Investment has been completed; or (y) the date on which the Company and the lenders would determine, in good faith, that the Hive-Down of the alfapump® business is not reasonably likely to occur; and (B) the date falling two years after the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. The 2025 Convertible Loan bears interest of 15% per annum, which shall be compounded on a monthly basis. In case of conversion or repayment in kind, the minimum amount to be converted for new shares or a new convertible loan will in any event be deemed to be 10% of the aggregate initial principal amount of the loans provided by the relevant lender (minus any compounded and accrued interest which has already been paid, converted or paid in kind to the relevant lender). The proceeds from the loan will be used to finance general working capital requirements (including, without limitation, the implementation of the relevant preparatory steps with respect to each Hive-Down). About the GEM committed share subscription facility of up to EUR 60 million The Capital Commitment will be released on the basis of drawdowns by the Company in the form of subscription request notices that the Company has the right to issue at its sole discretion. Each such subscription request notice shall require GEM, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for new ordinary shares that are to be issued by the Company. The drawdown amount reflected in such subscription request notices will be determined by the Company in function of certain parameters such as the Company's trading volume during a certain lookback period preceding the relevant subscription request notice, and the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the relevant subscription request notice. The issue price of the new shares to be subscribed to by GEM upon settlement of a subscription request notice will be determined on the basis of 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during a forward-looking pricing period (ranging between 1 and 20 consecutive trading days following the subscription request notice and ignoring certain knockout days), it being noted that such issue price shall not be lower than a floor price that can be set by the Company in the relevant subscription request notice (and which floor price may be different in each subscription request notice). After the aforementioned pricing period, GEM will have to subscribe for a number of new ordinary shares ranging between a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 150% of the drawdown amount requested to be subscribed for by the Company (subject to certain corrections). GEM agreed not to hold an excess of 19.9% of the ordinary shares of Sequana Medical. Existing shareholders Partners in Equity and LSP HEF Sequana Holding B.V. ("LSP") agreed to adhere to the Facility, and such lending shareholders will provide GEM a number of existing Sequana Medical shares for loan covering the draw down amount reflected in the relevant subscription notice request (the "Share Lending") and subject to certain additional and bilateral arrangements regarding the share lending arrangements provided for in the Facility and as set out in a share provision support agreement (the "Support Agreement"). The aforementioned lending shareholders are not compensated for providing the Share Lending to GEM, but related expenses will be covered by the Company. In consideration for entering into the Facility, GEM is entitled to receive warrants (subscription rights) to subscribe for up to 2,620,000 new ordinary shares of the Company. The Company will seek the approval by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting ("EGM") to issue the warrants. The warrant will give GEM the right to subscribe for new shares of the Company at an exercise price per underlying ordinary share that shall be equal to the lower of (x) EUR 1.95, and (y) 117% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the warrants will be issued by the EGM. The warrants will have a term of three years as of issuance, will be immediately exercisable, and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. An affiliate of GEM is also entitled to a commitment fee of EUR 400,000, which will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at an issue price that is equal to 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the trading day preceding the date on which the relevant ordinary shares will be issued. The relevant share issue will in principle occur on the business day prior to the settlement of the Company's first subscription request notice. About the amendments to the existing loan agreements Together with the entering into the 2025 Convertible Loan and the Facility, the Company also entered into an amendment agreement (the "Kreos Amendment Agreement") pursuant to which certain repayment and other terms of the EUR 10,000,000 loan with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates "Kreos", and such loan the "Kreos Loan")1 will be amended. The main amendments to the Kreos Loan can be summarised as follows (for information purposes): The Company will also enter into amendments in relation to the EUR 4,300,000 partially convertible loan with PMV Standaardleningen NV (formerly known as PMV/z Leningen NV) ("PMV") (the "PMV Loan"). The main amendments to this loan consist of: Based upon the expected drawdowns of the initial 20 EUR million Capital Commitment under the Facility, the Company forecasts this financing package will extend Sequana Medical's cash runway to the end of 2025, while continuing its search for future funding and assessment of potential other options. Sequana Medical has chosen this method of fundraising as it believes it provides flexibility in this crucial year that will be punctuated by major milestones, including the expected commencement of US commercialization in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target 90 US liver transplant centers. Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the Share Lending The following information is provided, as far as needed and applicable, pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the aforementioned Share Lending by Partners in Equity and LSP, the related adherence to the Facility between the Company and GEM, and the entering into of certain bilateral arrangements in relation to the Share Lending between the Company, Partners in Equity and LSP through the Support Agreement. Partners in Equity and LSP are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result, they could be considered as a "related party" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof, the board of directors of the Company applied, as far as needed and applicable, the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Ids van der Weij (a director, representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director, representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, prior to this announcement and the entering into of the Facility by the Company and GEM, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP, a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the "Committee") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate, short, and mid-term working capital needs of the Company, the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP in the framework of the Share Lending (including the contemplated Capital Increases, the Share Lending, and the issuance of the GEM Warrants (although subject to shareholder approval) and the Commitment Fee Shares, which each form an integral part of the SSFA), as well as the contemplated entering into and execution of the related Support Agreement, are in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. While entailing additional and important potential dilution and value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company as a result of the different share issuances contemplated in the SSFA, and while the Investor's trading (in particular sales) in the Company's shares under the share subscription facility reflected in the SSFA may have a downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels, ultimately the terms of the SSFA do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company and the fact that the SSFA will allow the Company to access equity financing in a fast, flexible and efficient manner to fund its activities and its ongoing working capital requirements, while further assessing financing options and without the obligation for the Company to make use of the relevant share subscription facility. The Committee notes in this regard that if the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. The Committee notes in particular that the Share Lending facility by PiE and LSP (who will not receive any compensation in this respect from the Company) will allow the Investor to hedge its risks against the amount that it has committed to subscribe to pursuant to the SSFA. Without the Share Lending facility and the willingness of PiE and LSP to adhere to the SSFA as Share Providers, the Investor would not have been willing to enter into the SSFA (as the Share Lending forms an integral part of the SSFA). On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending), and the related Support Agreement, currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the SSFA and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending) is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company." The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the Facility and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the entering into of the related Support Agreement, is as follows: "Based on our assessment, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 14 March 2025, and in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors dated 14 March 2025, which justify the contemplated transaction in writing and in a comprehensive manner, are not, in all material respects, fair and consistent with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement. Our engagement was solely conducted within the framework of the provisions of article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, and therefore our report cannot be used in any other context." Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the 2025 Convertible Loan The following information is provided pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the 2025 Convertible Loan granted by Partners in Equity and EQT to the Company. Partners in Equity and EQT are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company.

In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate working capital needs of the Company, the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. While subjecting the Company to increased debt, while entailing greater interest costs for the Company than the current financial indebtedness of the Company (other than the 2024 Convertible Loans), and while entailing additional and important potential dilution and/or value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company in case of settlement of the loans, ultimately the terms of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company. If the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its short term funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. As far as needed and applicable, the Committee has also taken into account the debt restructuring and the entering into of the Share Subscription Facility Agreement that will be announced together with the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. The Committee believes that the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement, the Share Subscription Facility Agreement, and the debt restructuring will allow the Company to extend the Company's cash runway and to strategically focus efforts and resources on raising additional and diversified equity or other financing and to implement remedial measures. On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2.

Title: Hong Kong's leader swipes at Trump but avoids criticism of tycoon's deal to sell Panama Port assets

Hong Kong’s leader says his government opposes coercion by foreign governments, an allusion to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, but stopped short of criticizing a prominent local conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a... HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings' in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing's family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

With New York critics loving his solo show, painter Paul Hughes talks about creativity Paul Hughes worked for Saatchi & Saatchi as a strategist On a Dublin 4 lane, you press the bell, a black metal grille is raised; you cross a courtyard and step into Paul Hughes’s bright studio. Music thrums and pulses. Sometimes it’s Vivaldi and Puccini, sometimes Philip Glass or Irish trad. Today it’s The KVB. The paintings, on the walls or stacked against them, are dazzlingly colourful. On the floor, tubes and tubs of paint. One work in particular – 5m x 2m, and as yet untitled – sings. It’s partly painted with his fingers, a hands-on work, and has a child-like energy and vibrancy that marks a new direction in Hughes’s work. Have you tried Focail and Conundrum?

Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been bleeding funds, with $900M in outflows over the past five weeks. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs have been experiencing a notable decline in inflows, with over $900 million in outflows recorded in the last five weeks. This sharp drop has fueled speculation about whether investor confidence in Bitcoin is beginning to wane. As institutional investors adjust their portfolios amid economic and regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s price has also been affected, dipping nearly 12% in the past month. With market sentiment shifting, a closer analysis of Bitcoin Spot ETF flows, and price trends is crucial to understanding where the market is headed. According to recent data from Sosovalue, BTC Spot ETFs have seen sustained outflows, with the latest weekly figures showing a net outflow of $921.4 million. This marks the fifth consecutive week of declining capital within these funds, bringing the total outflow to approximately $5.4 billion since mid-February. While BTC Spot ETFs initially saw significant inflows after their approval, recent redemptions suggest a shift in investor sentiment. Source: Sosovalue The timing of these outflows has coincided with Bitcoin’s price decline, which has dropped from $84,000 to approximately $77,000. While broader market factors contribute to Bitcoin’s volatility, the persistent ETF outflows indicate that institutional investors might be more cautious toward Bitcoin allocations in their portfolios. One of the key advantages of BTC Spot ETFs is their ability to attract institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. Prominent asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity introduced Bitcoin ETFs, offering a regulated investment option that provided Bitcoin exposure without requiring direct ownership. This led to an initial surge in inflows and contributed to Bitcoin reaching an all-time price high. However, institutional investors often utilize strategic, short-term capital allocation methods. During periods of market uncertainty, they tend to adjust positions swiftly, potentially explaining the current outflows. Analysts suggest that institutional investors could be redirecting funds to traditional assets or higher-yield opportunities as global financial markets react to inflation concerns and regulatory changes. There are several contributing factors to the recent BTC Spot ETF redemptions. One of the most significant concerns is macroeconomic conditions. Rising interest rates and inflation fears have led investors to reevaluate their portfolios, often prioritizing lower-risk assets over volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. With traditional markets offering more attractive risk-adjusted returns, Bitcoin Spot ETFs may face increased competition from traditional investment vehicles. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price volatility plays a role. Historically, large price corrections have triggered sell-offs, and the current price dip may have led some investors to liquidate their BTC holdings to secure profits or minimize losses. Despite the recent outflows, the long-term outlook for BTC Spot ETFs remains positive. The introduction of these funds has already had a positive effect on the cryptocurrency market, and there are indications that institutional adoption will continue to grow. However, in the short term, investors will closely monitor macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim key price levels. If Bitcoin can stabilize above $80,000, it may regain investor confidence, leading to renewed inflows into BTC Spot ETFs. On the other hand, if outflows persist and Bitcoin struggles to find support, a prolonged period of market uncertainty could follow.
