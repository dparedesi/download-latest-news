Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the United States are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the US leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump “friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. “Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock Inc, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that “aligns itself politically to the US ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” Gramercy Fund Management, which was set up by veteran investor Robert Koenigsberger in 1998, echoed the view in its quarterly strategy outlook, saying the beginning of the new US administration should be characterised by a stronger emphasis on bilateral relations at the expense of multilateral ones. Bonds from countries including Argentina and El Salvador could enjoy “some market premium” at the start of the year thanks to their leaders having a good relationship with Trump, according to Gramercy. Turkey, India and Hungary could also benefit. Since Trump secured his return to the White House, dollar bonds of Argentina, Ecuador and El Salvador have handed investors gains of at least 11%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 2.3% return for a benchmark index of developing-nation credits. Fears that Trump’s economic measures might boost the dollar and fan inflation in the world’s largest economy, cutting the room the Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates, have muddied the waters for developing economies. A lack of clarity around Trump’s tariff plans, which could have devastating impacts in emerging nations, have also dimmed the outlook for the asset class, which has been grappling with back-to-back annual outflows. Asian economies fare worse than emerging peers, with high trade surpluses against the US and secondary effects from measures on Chinese trade that risk stifling the region’s growth. Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are some of the most at-risk nations should Trump enact across the board tariffs, with exports to the US as a percent of GDP in the double digits, according to US government data compiled by Bloomberg. “Identifying Trump’s friends and enemies is very important. The obvious challenge with the US is for China and everything that follows on from that,” said Arnab Das, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management Ltd. in London. “The tariffs are going to be levelled at different countries for all kinds of transgressions and bad behavior.” As part of a larger strategy to avoid any confrontation with Trump, India is already considering options to narrow its trade surplus with the US, possibly through a trade deal, cutting tariffs or importing more goods from the US. The country is also prepared to work with the Trump administration to identify and take back all of its residents residing illegally in the US. Investors in Europe have the additional complication of disentangling Trump’s views on individual countries and their leaders from his general approach to the European Union. Hungary, whose leader Viktor Orban is frequently praised by Trump and other US conservatives for a governance style Orban has called “illiberal democracy,” is a prime example for traders. ‘Winning’ In Latin America, El Salvador, Argentina and Ecuador are expected to receive strong US support during Trump’s term, according to Ricardo Penfold, a managing director at Seaport Global. Argentina’s dollar bonds have been on a tear due to Milei’s harsh austerity plan, and his affinity with Trump — he was one of the few foreign leaders to attend the US President’s swearing in — may help the country skirt tariffs, avoiding additional pressure for its beleaguered currency, said Jeff Grills, head of US cross-asset and emerging-markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. El Salvador has already started taking in US military planes filled with deported migrants and is working with Trump to develop an asylum agreement. Daniel Noboa’s tough policies against transnational gangs and his support for foreign military bases in Ecuador — should he win the upcoming election — will also appeal to Trump, said Nathalie Marshik, a managing director at HSBC in New York. Whiplash Meantime, countries that Trump had gone after so far have seen their asset prices getting whiplashed. Traders soured on Colombia earlier this week after a migration dispute resulted in a brief, but unexpected tariff spat, sending the currency down as much as 2% in one day. Panama, whose leader rebuked Trump’s threat to reassert control of the Panama Canal, saw JPMorgan Chase & Co downgrade its recommendation on the country’s bonds. Markets should take the risk more seriously and there’s “little clarity on the endgame,” strategists including Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a note last week. In Mexico, investors are waiting to see if Trump will enact the planned 25% tariffs on the country’s goods on Saturday. The White House said on Friday that Trump intends to move ahead with the idea, denying a report that he planned on delaying the implementation by a month. Unlike Mexico, Turkey has a balanced relationship with the US as the $29 billion trade volume is almost equally split between exports and imports, according to the US government data for 2024. However, this did not spare the country in 2018, when Trump sanctioned senior Turkish officials and raised tariffs on some imports in response to the extended detention of an American citizen, sending local markets into turmoil. While a good relationship with the US might help, it’s no guarantee of outperformance. Local factors — from elections in Ecuador to an IMF deal in Argentina — are still key to sustain gains. “The lesson learned is that Trump is willing to push very aggressively to use sanctions and tariff threats to achieve his policy objectives,” said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. “There are a number of countries in the region that will end up capitulating.”

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 5:12:37 PM PST by Libloather Tech billionaire Elon Musk ripped alleged "fraudulent" Treasury payments on Saturday as reports circulated that the Department of Government Efficiency has gained acces to the federal government's payment system as the second Trump administration continues cutting what they say is government fat and overspending. "The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once," Musk, the chair of DOGE, posted early Saturday morning to X. Musk's post came just ahead of the New York Times reporting Saturday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel access to the payment system. The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 3:33:00 PM PST by governsleastgovernsbest On Sunday's edition of The Weekend on MSNBC, weeknight host Chris Hayes questioned Trump's machismo for imposing higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico than on China. He's tougher on allies than on adversaries, because that's easier, less risky. He even claimed Trump has been "extremely generous to adversaries" like Russia and China.

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/robinhood-ceo-warns-lack-of-u-s-regulation-stifles-security-tokenization-efforts/

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Krisztian Sandor Vlad Tenev joined BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in calling for clear regulations for tokenized securities in the U.S. Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind,” Tenev wrote. “It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to “rapidly approve” tokenization of stocks and bonds.

Title: BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF Records 5250 BTC Inflows, Will The Rally Sustain?

BlackRock spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF saw massive inflows following the broader market rebound. Bitcoin ETFs have continued to dominate institutional demand for crypto assets since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the funds. Inflows spiked the total digital assets market cap above $3.3 trillion, gaining over 4% in the US trading hours. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) recorded 5,250 Bitcoins in the last 24 hours. This shows growing institutional demand for BTC and other crypto assets, swinging the price past the $100K mark. BlackRock’s inflow outpaced the total daily production, signaling high institutional demand as bulls resume accumulation. Data from Farside shows that the total inflows on Jan 16 stood at $626 million, with IBIT and ArkInvests ARKB controlling the charts. IBIT captured 85% of demand, while the latter saw a huge $155 million in the same time frame. IBIT volumes outpaced both institutional investors and BTC production. The fund recorded 12 times more than the daily 450 Bitcoin production. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC notched $4.4 million,n while Bitwise’s fund attracted $2.7 million. BlackRock has remained a popular option for most institutional investors since its launch. The fund has over $55.6 billion in assets under management (AUM), exposing traditional investors to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s bid for an ETF in 2023 spiked interest from other traditional firms that filed similar applications. After the approval, the surge in applications and demand ignited the bull cycle, taking the asset price to an all-time high above $73K in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiast Solana Legend tipped a higher target for the wider market due to surging ETF demand and other factors. “We have the richest man in the world joining forces with the president to kick off a golden age for emergent technology BTC ETF is the most successful ETF launch of all time Strategic Crypto Reserve being floated. Adjust your targets higher.” The success of Bitcoin products increased investor appetite, leading to a demand for altcoin products. After the launch of spot Ethereum ETF, several firms have filed for Solana and XRP products. Skyrocketing optimism has also led to huge inflows in these assets ahead of anticipated pro-crypto legislation. While the present administration was hostile to the market, Donald Trump has pledged a pro-market approach, giving investors confidence. Demand for spot XRP products in the United States is a major factor for the sharp increase in price.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/02/02/3-high-yield-closed-end-funds-to-buy-tech-stocks-for-less/

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Fed Just Confirmed A Huge Crypto Game-Changer As Trump Sparks Bitcoin Price Crash Fears

02/03 update below. This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, topping $100,000 per bitcoin and driving ... [+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers' due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn't be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. "It's just getting very hard to make ends meet," Wetherington said. "The way the world is right now, everything's going up, up, up." Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It's also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the "Peak 65 zone." The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. "It's really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now," said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group "can help build key capacity where it's desperately needed." While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America's population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program's "full retirement age" from 65 to 67. "People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits," Quinby said. "That shift triggered a trend in people working longer." Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it's "a bit crazy" that the expectation of retiring at 65 "originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire." Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School's Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it "because they have to." They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can't sustain them. "I call it the tale of two retirements," Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. "The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy," said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra's human resources chief. "They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience." Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. "They're like vintage cars to us," said FedCap's Malatras. "They're built to last, they're full of value, but they're treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don't really have an opportunity to serve anymore." Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren't any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP's pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix's argument for employers is the impending "tsunami" of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don't tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they'll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn't all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there's a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra's sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. "People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams," Tinsley-Fix said. "They really benefit from having those folks." Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they've benefited physically and mentally. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me," said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson's role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That's where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn't for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a "shock" after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. "I don't enjoy not having things I have to do," Sallee said. "I never envisioned the 'sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail' kind of lifestyle." Still, Sallee said she's taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. "If that ever becomes a problem," she said of her yearly stretch of time off, "the vacation will take priority." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has increased its dividend for 20 consecutive years, with an average annual growth rate of 10.22% over the past three years. Among pure-play technology companies, it is only among a handful of tech stocks to achieve this kind of stability and growth over the past three or four decades. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: After DEI, the next frontier is ESG
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/02/after_dei_the_next_frontier_is_esg.html

Full Content:
DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain

Title: Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST): Among the Best Alcohol Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Alcohol Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other alcohol stocks. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. Liquor tends to enjoy stable sales even when general consumer spending takes a hit elsewhere, while there have also been times when alcohol sales even increase during economic downturns, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008-09. READ ALSO: 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers However, things haven’t been exactly easy for the alcohol sector lately, especially after the recent report from the U.S. Surgeon General claimed that alcohol consumption in the country is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually. The report has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The proposition, if enacted, could seriously hurt sales for a sector that is already struggling with a pullback in drinking by younger consumers. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. The growing popularity of low-and no-alcohol products, rising prevalence of cannabis use, and anti-obesity drugs picking up steam certainly haven’t helped either. Another looming threat for the American liquor industry is that of tariffs. The European Union is due to reimpose its retaliatory tariff on American whiskey in late March, but at a higher rate of 50%. Over the last two years, American whiskey exports to the EU have surged by more than 60%, and total US spirits exports grew to a record high of $2.2 billion in 2023. But this success story could face a devastating turn unless President Trump's administration can swiftly negotiate a prolonged suspension or permanent removal of the tariff. However, amidst the sharp decline in sales following the pandemic, one category that could be a bright spot for the struggling booze industry is that of spirit-based RTD’s, despite the fall in the overall spirits segment. Americans consumed over 62 million cases of ready-to-drink spirits in 2023, up almost 25% from 2022, making it the second-largest spirit category by volume, right behind vodka. A plethora of new brands have popped up in the market over the last few years, offering canned versions of many bar classics, including Negroni, Daiquiri, and even the good ol’ Jack & Coke. The alcohol sector also seems to be responding adequately to the evolving consumer trends by investing heavily in a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US. Nearly every major industry player has come up with No-Lo versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don’t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. To collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the alcohol sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of January 27, 2024. Following are the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Analysts. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Stock Upside Potential: 18.43% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks is one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), known for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. Shares of MNST have gained over 46% over the last 5 years, with analysts predicting further gains in the future. A notable aspect of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is its strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, which has owned an approximate 16.7% stake in the energy drinks company since 2015. This gives Monster access to Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network and provides it a competitive edge in international markets. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has recently been facing challenges in the domestic market, as the energy drinks market in the US continues to struggle. In Q3 of 2024, the company management also pointed to ‘excess inventory levels’ of its Alcohol Brands segment, suggesting slower sales of those products than expected. However, despite these challenges, Monster has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the US market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that the company’s brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s globalization strategy also seems to be paying off as international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing the company’s reliance on the tough domestic market. The international emerging markets are particularly attractive for Monster. As disposable incomes rise in these regions and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. However, such aggressive geographical diversification carries its own risks and the energy drinks giant took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MNST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines.

Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the latest quarter, the company returned $30 billion to shareholders. The current annual dividend stands at $0.92 per share, yielding approximately 0.39%. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) substantial cash reserves, totaling $68 billion as of June 2024, support its capacity to maintain and potentially increase these returns. Apple’s diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty contribute to its resilience during economic downturns. The significant growth in its services segment, which boasts higher margins, enhances revenue stability. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund with nearly $2 billion in assets under management — enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. Nvidia (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo — to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ — but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

Title: Trump’s $10 Trillion Crypto Bet: Stablecoins To Replace Eurodollars?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/02/01/trumps-10-trillion-opportunity-stablecoins-to-replace-eurodollars/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 16: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside U.S. ... [+] President-elect Donald Trump and Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce, Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick (L) at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on December 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) "I think over the next, call it 20ish years, probably the entire eurodollar market is moving to stablecoins," predicts Austin Campbell, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and CEO of WSPN USA. It's a bold claim – suggesting that a $210 billion market could absorb a system 50 times its size. Yet the prediction becomes more plausible when you understand how the offshore dollar market evolved, and why stablecoins represent its natural digital successor. The modern financial system runs on a form of dollars that most Americans have never heard of. Eurodollars – dollar deposits held outside the U.S. banking system – represent between $10-13 trillion in value. Born in the 1950s as a way for Soviet banks to hold dollars beyond U.S. reach, they grew into the backbone of international finance. Today, they're how Japanese manufacturers pay for Indonesian raw materials and how European banks fund American mortgages. This massive market emerged not through design but necessity. When Cold War politics made direct dollar holdings risky for Soviet institutions, they began keeping dollar deposits in European banks. These banks realized they could lend these dollars without maintaining the same reserves U.S. banks required, creating a more efficient (if less regulated) dollar funding market. Most Americans have never interacted with a stablecoin or a eurodollar, and many struggle to understand their value as they are well served by their domestic banking system. But Americans aren’t the only users of US dollars. A large percentage of dollars serve users outside America. Of the $2.3 trillion in physical U.S. banknotes, the Federal Reserve estimates that 40-75% circulate abroad. Traditional bank deposits show a similar pattern – the $18 trillion in U.S. domestic deposits is comparable to the size of the $10-13 trillion Eurodollar market. These numbers reveal a crucial reality: trillions of dollars already sit outside the U.S. banking system, held by individuals and businesses who need dollars but lack access to American banks. Stablecoins aren't creating this demand for offshore dollars – they're simply providing a more efficient solution for it. Originally stablecoins emerged as digital casino chips for crypto speculators. Just as a casino allows you to exchange dollars for chips that can be used throughout their property, stablecoins let you convert traditional dollars into digital tokens usable across the entire internet. And just like casino chips, their value is backed by real dollars held in reserve – at least in theory. The story of stablecoins can't be told without mentioning Tether (USDT), which remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of over $100 billion. Founded in 2014 to solve crypto traders' need for a stable trading instrument, Tether's history reads like a thriller. Early controversies about its reserves – which once included commercial paper and mysterious "other investments" – gave way to increased transparency following regulatory scrutiny. Today, Tether primarily backs its tokens with U.S. Treasuries, managed by Cantor Fitzgerald under CEO Howard Lutnick (pictured above) – who is set to serve as Secretary of Commerce. This institutional evolution mirrors the broader transformation of the stablecoin industry from crypto frontier to mainstream finance. Newer entrants like Circle's USDC have taken a more regulated approach from the start. Circle's partnership with BlackRock for reserve management signals the institutionalization of the sector. Yet it is still early days for stablecoins. As analyst Simon Taylor explains, "We're in the dial-up era of Stablecoins, so they're still janky, and connecting is slow and painful. In time, Stablecoins will create an abstraction layer above existing payment rails, just as the Internet did over the telcos." Nevertheless, Taylor's analysis reveals why stablecoins aren't just cheaper – they're fundamentally better infrastructure. Traditional international payments involve a complex web of correspondent banks, SWIFT messages, multiple compliance checks, and days of settlement time. The genius of stablecoins lies in collapsing this complexity into a single layer. A stablecoin transfer is more akin to handing someone cash than initiating a bank wire – but it can happen instantly across borders. Recent research from Castle Island Ventures and Visa reveals the scale of adoption already underway. Stablecoin transaction volumes were estimated at $450 billion per month—roughly half of the just over $1 trillion that Visa processes monthly. Adoption is growing fastest in emerging markets. The study found that 47% of users in developing economies primarily use stablecoins for dollar savings, while 43% cite currency conversion as their main goal. This adoption isn't merely speculative. In Nigeria, where foreign exchange shortages are chronic, stablecoins have become crucial for international trade. As Yellow Card, Africa's largest stablecoin platform notes, "70% of African countries have a FX shortage that has been declared a crisis." The latest evolution comes from yield-bearing variants such as Mountain Protocol. Just as Eurodollar deposits typically offered higher interest rates than domestic U.S. deposits, new stablecoins are finding ways to pass along the yields from their Treasury holdings to users. This development suggests how stablecoins might eventually compete with traditional bank deposits. In his inauguration speech, Donald Trump argued for the creation of an “External Revenue Service” to collect revenue from other countries. Given that stablecoin advocate Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will be involved in its creation, perhaps the president already had the shift from Eurodollars to stablecoins in mind. The transition from Eurodollars to stablecoins could mark a significant shift in America's global financial power. Eurodollars emerged during the Cold War, when U.S. policymakers saw value in allowing European banks to create dollar liquidity beyond American shores. Today's geopolitical reality is markedly different. In an era of great power competition and economic warfare, the diffuse Eurodollar system may have outlived its strategic utility. Stablecoins offer Washington a chance to recentralize control over offshore dollars. When foreign banks create Eurodollars, they share in the profits of dollar dominance. In contrast, major stablecoin issuers back their tokens primarily with U.S. Treasuries, directly funding American government debt. This shift would align with the more zero-sum view of international relations championed by figures like President Trump, concentrating the benefits of dollar dominance within U.S. borders. The winners in this transition would be concentrated in America: the U.S. Treasury would see increased demand for its debt, while U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would become the new gatekeepers of global dollar liquidity. Users in emerging markets would gain better access to dollars, potentially accelerating global dollarization. The losers would be equally clear: non-U.S. banks would see their Eurodollar business evaporate, while weak local currencies would face even steeper competition from digital dollars. Traditional payment intermediaries would find their business models undermined by more efficient stablecoin rails. Can stablecoins really absorb the $10 trillion Eurodollar market? The better question might be: why wouldn't they? They offer the same basic service – dollar exposure outside traditional U.S. banking – with added benefits of programmability, transparency, and efficiency. The transition won't happen overnight, but as Campbell suggests, the direction seems clear. Just as Eurodollars emerged to meet the 20th century's need for efficient dollar funding, stablecoins are evolving to serve the digital economy's demand for programmable, borderless dollars. The real question isn't whether digital dollars will become ubiquitous, but whether the U.S. will embrace and shape this transition to maintain its financial advantages in the digital age.

Title: NatWest finalises £450m bonus pot as return to private ownership looms

The bank's annual results will come with the government on the brink of no longer being its single-biggest shareholder after nearly 17 years, Sky News can reveal. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 1 February 2025 11:40, UK NatWest Group is finalising plans to pay out close to £450m in bonuses for last year as it prepares for a return to full private ownership nearly 17 years after its bailout. Sky News has learnt that the bank's remuneration committee is close to signing off the bonus pool ahead of its annual results announcement later this month. The figure of roughly £450m will be about 25% higher than last year's bonus pot of £356m, reflecting NatWest's sharply improved performance in 2024, according to City sources. Shares in the bank, which at one point was more than 80%-owned by British taxpayers, have nearly doubled over the last 12 months. The Treasury has been rapidly reducing its stake in NatWest, with it now standing at just under 8%. This weekend, Sky News can also reveal that the state will cease to become the company's single-biggest shareholder within a matter of weeks, based on the current pace of the government's trading plan, which drip-feeds stock into the market. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, holds a stake in NatWest of roughly 6%, meaning it could replace the Treasury as NatWest's biggest investor as early as this month. Markets react to Trump's tariffs as he warns UK 'out of line' on trade with US Trump tariffs: How the UK finds itself in a strong position on US trade Donald Trump's tariffs: What's going on and what does it all mean? That would represent another significant milestone for NatWest's board, chaired by Rick Haythornthwaite. In October, the bank raised its profit outlook after posting a 26% rise in third-quarter income. After its shares closed at 433.1p on Friday afternoon, it now has a market capitalisation of close to £35bn. Last year, Sky News revealed that NatWest was planning to hand its chief executive a potential multimillion pound pay boost as it returns to full private ownership. Lena Wilson, the chair of the bank's remuneration committee has been consulting leading institutional shareholders about an overhaul of its boardroom pay policy, with the proposals to be put to a vote at its spring AGM. Under the plans, Paul Thwaite, who took over as the bank's interim chief executive in July 2023 before being handed the role on a permanent basis in February, would be in line for an increase in his maximum annual bonus from 100% of his base salary to 150%. NatWest also intends to replace its restricted share plan (RSP) for Mr Thwaite, which awarded him stock worth a maximum of 150% of his salary, with a performance share plan (PSP) which could pay him up to three times his basic pay each year. Assuming his salary of just under £1.2m remains unchanged, that would mean him being in line for a maximum reward package - excluding pension contributions and other items - of about £6.6m, up from roughly £4.2m today. The prospective increase would bring Mr Thwaite's compensation more closely into line with peers including Charlie Nunn at Lloyds Banking Group and CS Venkatakrishnan at Barclays - who himself is expected to see his annual pay capped at just over £14m under a new policy. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose after she was forced to step down over the debanking row involving Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader. Leading City investors who have been part of the consultation process are said to be overwhelmingly supportive of the pay overhaul. Follow our channel and never miss an update. During its previous incarnation as Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank encountered annual controversy over its remuneration - for its chief executives and the wider workforce. In the immediate aftermath of its £45.5bn rescue by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008, the pension package of Fred Goodwin, RBS's former chief, and bonuses awarded to his successor, Stephen Hester, became political headaches for the governments of Gordon Brown and David Cameron. In recent years, however, such conflagrations have been defused by a combination of pay restraint and improved performance. Even after the recent recovery in its valuation, taxpayers will see a loss running to billions of pounds from NatWest's emergency bailout. A NatWest Group spokesperson declined to comment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other long term low risk stocks. As the DeepSeek craze ignites a sell-off in the tech sector, investors are weighing the implications of the downturn in the long term. This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the "Lagnificent 7" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. There are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration. Strategies may include diversifying portfolios, focusing on undervalued sectors, and closely monitoring economic indicators to navigate the evolving landscape.

The stock has declined in recent days after the firm posted fourth-quarter earnings, reporting earnings per share of $2.14 on sales of $6.5 billion, slightly below Wall Street's expectations of $2.16 per share, but sales exceeding the forecast of $6.4 billion. In Q3 2024, the firm achieved revenues of $5.8 billion, a 3% year-over-year increase, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 0.5%.

Why were open cups great? 1. Usually weekends, allowing people to have a hobby out if work and do well in it. 2. Conquest format, same as the actual tournaments they are hosting. Not the best 1 deck bo1 grinder, but people who managed to master multiple decks. 3. Less play required to qualify, allowing people with less resilience or less free time to qualify Without cups, I don't feel like HS is an esport anymore.

Title: Eli Hewson of Inhaler: ‘There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2025/02/01/eli-hewson-of-inhaler-theres-so-much-nepotism-in-every-facet-of-life/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T05:20:00Z
Full Content:
When the four members of Inhaler walked in front of 80,000 people at Slane Castle in June 2023, they felt as if they’d tumbled down a rabbit hole and emerged blinking into a fantasy movie. “You can see how far back the hill goes, and you see the extent of people there. I remember turning to one of the guys and going, ‘What the f**k are we doing?’ And I remember being so nervous,” says Ryan McMahon, the drummer with the Dublin rock band. Eli Hewson, the group’s frontman, says: “I was expecting to get booed off the stage. Everyone was there for Harry Styles.” Seated beside him, Josh Jenkinson, who plays guitar, smiles and says that their friends and family were excited about Slane largely because it put Inhaler in the orbit of the former One Direction star, who was the day’s headliner. “All our girlfriends at the time were over the moon. It did genuinely feel we were in a scene from Lord of the Rings.” Styles was creating history as that rare pop star to headline the Co Meath venue. The day was equally significant for Inhaler, who confirmed their status as one of Ireland’s fast-rising major-label rock bands. Despite the jitters and concerns about being jeered into oblivion by the hordes of teenage girls, they are happy to report that the gig went fine. Two years later they are ready to take another leap forward with their glossy, crowd-pleasing third LP, Open Wide. It’s a slick, hook-filled affair that is brimming with easy-on-the-ear melodies (as in Eddie in the Darkness, the opening track), Coldplay-worthy “ooh ooh” choruses (Billy – Yeah Yeah Yeah) and finger-snapping grooves (the single Your House). It will appeal to all those Styles fans they won over at Slane – and even a few of those they didn’t. That’s partly thanks to the influence of the producer Kid Harpoon – Styles’s regular wingman in the recording studio – who encouraged Inhaler to push further and to connect with their inner pop stars. The other big draw is the charismatic presence of Hewson, who at moments sounds like a dead ringer for his father, Paul, known to some as Bono. Inhaler are understandably wary of coming across as some sort of novelty U2 offshoot: Baby Bono plus some pals from private school. (Three of Inhaler met at St Andrew’s College in Blackrock, one of Dublin’s most exclusive secondary schools.) Yet they are self-aware about their gilded backgrounds and understand the U2 factor is something they must negotiate. They can’t shut their eyes and hope it goes away. With or without them, people are going to draw a connection. “I always thought I was going to have a harder time than I actually did. My sister had a hard time,” the singer says about Eve Hewson, the actor. “There’s certain advantages to it.” You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith A famous father puts you in the spotlight, no question. “People coming for the first time to see you – you might sell a few more tickets in the beginning, or whatever. But it’s not going to make people come back,” says Hewson, a matey, down-to-earth 25-year-old who seems at pains not to project nepo-baby privilege. “You know what I mean? There is definitely a certain perception of you before people have heard you. So [you] kind of weigh it up. The other thing is that it’s not something we want to pretend isn’t happening. That would be silly.” On the other hand, Hewson doesn’t feel he’s playing life on easy mode by starting a band with friends. He has been surrounded by music his entire life: what’s so strange about wanting to pick up a guitar and sing? “It just makes me laugh. You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith. There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life.” Hewson shrugs, at pains to clarify that he isn’t complaining. “When it’s in the public eye ... you’re allowed give it a bit of scrutiny.” Of course, being a blacksmith and being the second-youngest child of Bono and Ali Hewson are two very different things. (That’s 18-year-old Hewson on the cover of U2’s 2017 LP Songs of Experience, as snapped by the music photographer Anton Corbijn). For one thing, people don’t spend all their time badmouthing blacksmiths on social media. With Bono it’s another story. For all his popularity, the U2 singer is also one of his generation’s most widely criticised rock stars – especially in Ireland. In the past 12 months alone the neotrad group Lankum have called him “Such a f****** West Brit” on stage in Dublin and Mary Coughlan has said she was “grossed out by the whole lot” of U2. How does Hewson feel about people continually taking potshots at his father? “I think I’m well used to it – like, I’ve seen it plenty. I’d just say get to know him first. That’s all I’ll say on it.” Inhaler look every centimetre the off-duty rock band sitting around a table in a hotel in South Dublin, a stone’s throw from their alma mater. Leather jackets, tight trousers, boho man jewellery, a tour manager who has ushered them to the venue straight from rehearsals: they tick all the boxes. Except one. Although their first two albums, It Won’t Always Be Like This and Cuts & Bruises, were well reviewed, they have none of the critical acclaim of fellow Dublin acts such as Lankum or Fontaines DC (whose 2018 show at the Tivoli Theatre, with The Murder Capital and Shame, they name as a life-changing gig for them). They radiate faint yet unmistakable traces of dorkiness – a trait they are happy to own. “We’ve always worn it on our sleeve when people meet us. It’s the same as when we do interviews and ... blah-lah ... we’re just, like, kind of dorks,” they say, speaking over one another. “I don’t think we’ve got to be conceptually cool. We’re just ourselves. We’re uncool sometimes.” Inhaler have also had to negotiate what might be called the “South Dublin” question. St Andrew’s is one of Ireland’s most expensive private schools. When you come from that background people make assumptions: that your life has been full of opportunity rather than adversity, that your tipple of choice is Heineken, that you have firm views on the state of the Leinster lineout. “It exists,” McMahon says of such inverse snobby. “But if you want to say that about one person ... No one says that about Radiohead or The Rolling Stones.” “It doesn’t matter,” Hewson adds. “But it wouldn’t be home without it.” Inhaler started when Hewson, McMahon and Robert Keating, their bassist, were at school in 2012. Three years later they met Jenkinson at a party. In their early years they were a “sh*tty metal band”, though they evolved into something more melodic when they discovered The Stone Roses – still one of their favourites. At this point it was decided that Hewson should take over from Keating as lead singer, which the retiring adolescent did with a degree of reluctance. (The name Inhaler comes from the fact that he had asthma in his teens.) “It was never a dream as a kid. I started singing out of necessity.” He adds, about overcoming shyness, “I’m definitely better than I was. I was bad a lot of the time ... It’s a miracle, really, to be honest.” With their first two albums they wrote songs largely so they would have material to perform live. The new LP is different as they went into the studio determined to grow as songwriters. That’s why they chose to work with Kid Harpoon. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’ The producer – real name Tom Hull – cracked the whip during recording sessions at RAK Studios in London (where The Pogues made Fairytale of New York). He didn’t hesitate to tell them if he felt a tune wasn’t cutting it. “Honesty is probably the most valuable thing in a studio setting from your producer,” Hewson says. “We had loads of songs that weren’t finished. We went to him hoping that he’d pull it together. And he was, like, ‘You’re not done’. So we had to go back and finish them. We actually found a different way of writing that was more effective.” It is fashionable to decry the death of the old-fashioned four-piece band. Guitar music has certainly become less culturally central – the reality is that the biggest event in rock this year will be the return of Oasis, a band who peaked in 1995, four years before Hewson was born. But Inhaler feel that is starting to change. Bands are back. “When we were in school it was all Ed Sheeran. No offence to him: we still love pop music. But I’m talking about bands. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’. Now you’ve got Sam Fender smashing it in the UK, Fontaines, Murder Capital, Last Dinner Party, Wunderhorse … There’s a lot of great music to listen to,” Hewson says. “I don’t know if that’s a result of the stagnant pop music we’ve heard ... It’s nice to hear something visceral. It feels more analogue-y than digital, which is refreshing. I’m happy about it.” A big summer awaits. Inhaler are touring Britain, the Americas and Australia. Hewson’s birthday coincides with one of Oasis’s Croke Park dates and he hopes to attend. (He knows Noel Gallagher a bit through his father.) Then there is a show at St Anne’s Park in Dublin – their biggest Irish headline concert to date, with a capacity of 20,000. “In the beginning we went to the UK and we gigged a lot there. We always felt we were missing home,” Hewson says. “It’s nice to be able to facilitate a gathering in your hometown. What an honour. We’ll do our best job. I think it will be great with the new music.” Open Wide is released on Friday, February 7th; Inhaler play St Anne’s Park, Dublin, on Friday, May 30th © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the U.S. are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the U.S. leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump "friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. "Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that "aligns itself politically to the U.S. ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Title: Trump Treasury Department Exits Global Climate Alliance Pushing Green Mandates on Financial Sector
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-treasury-department-exits-global-climate-alliance-pushing-green-mandates-on-financial-sector/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T19:15:18Z

The Treasury Department withdrew the United States from a global climate alliance that was launched to push the financial sector to adopt green mandates. The so-called Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System was originally created to pressure banks and financial institutions to meet sweeping global climate targets, many of which have been set during United Nations summits. The Treasury Department said late Thursday that the alliance's mission doesn't align with the Trump administration's "priorities to grow the U.S. economy and American jobs." The announcement is part of the Trump administration's move to exit what it considers to be harmful global climate agreements. And it is the latest signal to the international community that the United States under Trump's leadership will seek to prioritize domestic energy production over commitments to bolster green energy and fight global warming. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, told the Washington Free Beacon that the withdrawal is a "major victory for consumers" and that the alliance "only existed to push a radical climate agenda onto taxpayers." The alliance's efforts, according to a review of its website and governing documents, fall in line with the broader green investing movement, which pushes financial institutions to divest from fossil fuel production and infrastructure and invest in green energy to stop climate change. "Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with impacts that are felt worldwide and necessitate urgent, coordinated action," the group states. The group is also one of the most high profile alliances of its kind worldwide—the alliance boasts 144 members across more than 90 countries, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England. The Biden administration had joined the alliance in February 2022. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive action ordering the State Department to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords. "President Trump is committed to pursuing an American First policy agenda," the State Department said in a subsequent internal memo confirming it had executed Trump's order. "The Paris Agreement prompted restrictions on America's ability to harvest vast natural resources and constraints on the American economy through oppressive domestic regulations." And the withdrawal comes two weeks after the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative—a private sector alliance whose mission largely mimicked that of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System—said it would suspend all operations. That decision was triggered after a number of the group's members, including trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock, withdrew ahead of Trump's inauguration. "For too long ESG elites like BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink have been using political influence to manipulate federal agencies into pushing ESG on consumers and stunting the American economy," Hild, of Consumers’ Research, told the Free Beacon. "But thanks to President Trump's swift actions, the administration continues to remove the rot that is ESG from American institutions," he continued. "There is still more work to be done, and Consumers' Research remains committed to holding institutions accountable if they continue their senseless devotion to destructive ideological fads like ESG at the expense of taxpayers and consumers."

Title: Can We Still Solve Climate Change?

Tuesday, February 4, 2025 SAN FRANCISCO, California / APEX, North Carolina, Jan 31 2025 (IPS) - When it comes to climate change, the awful news has been coming thick and fast. We now know that in 2024, the Earth’s average temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. Extreme weather seems to be multiplying, with shocking fires in Los Angeles and storms striking Europe and America’s east coast since the start of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his country will turn its back on the ambitious Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ latest annual summit—COP29 in Azerbaijan—ended in November with complaints it had done too little to change the narrative. Some even questioned whether the UN’s ongoing exertions were a waste of time, and whether annual global climate summits were still worth doing? Are things really so bad? Let’s break down the news piece-by-piece and look at each issue in turn. How bad is it that we have broken the 1.5C ceiling? It’s pretty bad. It means we can expect extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and flooding to increase in frequency and severity. It’s also going to affect food production, harm many plant and animal species, and risk sending the world over several “tipping points”, such as faster melting of ice in the Arctic, Antarctic, and elsewhere, causing sea-level rise. If you don’t like that our weather is getting more extreme, then sadly it’s too late. We’ll all have to get used to it, and adapt accordingly. That said, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some silver linings. First, the world has actually been doing a lot to fight back. Partly prompted by major international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, countries have been actively finding ways to reduce emissions, such as investing in green technologies and working on new policies that affect pretty much everything we do. Whether it’s new energy efficiency programmes in our homes and offices, efforts to protect our forests, or the rise in hybrid and electric vehicles, a lot is happening. Perhaps the biggest transformation has been the growth of solar and wind power, which is now considerably cheaper and more efficient that earlier sources of electricity like coal or natural gas. The pay-off is clear, with countries like the UK, Sweden, and Denmark already cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in half since the 1990s. Another silver lining of our efforts to cut emissions is expert projections for temperature rise in the longer term. Before the Paris Agreement, some were predicting temperatures to go up by 4-6C by 2100, which would be catastrophic for humanity and the planet; an extinction event for modern civilization. Now, the estimates sit around 2-2.8C, depending on whether countries honour the goals they’ve set themselves. These numbers are still bad, but nowhere near as terrifying as they were. So yes, 1.5 is bad and we will need to redouble our efforts to make sure it doesn’t get much worse. But we shouldn’t give up hope just yet. What does President Trump’s decision to leave the Paris Agreement mean? No one can deny that U.S. leadership greatly helps our global efforts to combat climate change. Still, there are several reasons why we shouldn’t panic. First, as mentioned above, the world is already on a long-term path to cut emissions. The new U.S. administration may wish to “drill, baby, drill,” but renewables will continue to rise. Why? Because they’re cheaper than the alternatives. As an experienced business leader, President Trump knows as well as anyone that companies are motivated by profits. They will look for the most cost-effective energy option. In many cases, this will mean renewable energy. Secondly, even if the U.S. does leave Paris and change its domestic policies, there is an inertia in systems. The outgoing Biden administration, which had pledged $3 billion for the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), has already handed over $2 billion. They’ve also spent much larger amounts on supporting the U.S. transition to a green economy. This is money the new President will not be able to take back. Plus, a country as big and powerful as America can’t turn its entire economy around overnight. For instance, during President Trump’s first term, emissions in the U.S. continued to fall, even if he himself did not support this. Thirdly, even American presidents aren’t all powerful. There are many other interests and alternative viewpoints in the U.S. Others who might disagree with President Trump will likely step up and try to fill the gap. For instance, business leader Michael Bloomberg has just announced that he will help cover U.S. financial obligations to the UN and its climate work. There is precedent for this, too. Back in the 2000s, a lot of progress was made on climate change at the state and city level throughout the U.S., even though President George W. Bush generally didn’t support it. Finally, there has been a shift in the centre of gravity when it comes to climate change. The U.S. remains important, but on climate change it matters less than it once did. Under Presidents Obama, Biden, and Trump himself, U.S. emissions have fallen. They now represent about 11% of the global total, down from 30% in 1970. These days, U.S. emissions are dwarfed by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). These are the countries whose leadership will be needed in the decade to come. There are signs that big corporate players are also turning away from their climate pledges. For instance, Blackrock just left the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition. What does this mean? The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was announced at COP26 in 2021. It brings together corporate leaders from the financial services sector to support the transition to an ambitious “net-zero” emissions economy. However, after the recent U.S. election, some big U.S. banks left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which is part of GFANZ. Now, Blackrock has left a similar coalition for asset managers; which is also a part of GFANZ. This is not good news. It probably marks a symbolic victory for politicians who had been pressuring big corporate interests to step back from their climate pledges. In some ways, it mirrors the recent abandonment by several big American companies of their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programmes. At this stage, it is hard to know how much of a genuine impact this will have. For every company trying to appease the Trump administration by backtracking, it is likely there will also be those—like insurance companies—whose profits are being so badly impacted by climate change that they will be unlikely to change their positions. The latest UN climate summit brought no major breakthroughs but it did achieve some modest successes. Credit: Shutterstock. Was COP29 really a failure? No. Although the latest annual UN climate summit didn’t result in any big breakthroughs, it did achieve some modest successes. For instance, wealthy industrialized nations agreed to increase annual funding for developing countries from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2030. This is far less than the US$1.3 trillion many experts believe is needed to combat climate change, though that number was included as a goal for 2035. Although US$300 billion is an improvement on the previous amount, it’s not what developing countries were hoping for, which was closer to $500 billion by 2030. Other outcomes from COP29 include agreement on standards for carbon markets, which means carbon trading is likely to increase and new finances might flow to the Global South. What’s more, several countries announced that they would strengthen their pledges—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—under the Paris Agreement. These included Azerbaijan, Brazil, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Shouldn’t COP29 have done a lot more, given the urgency of the climate crisis? As we have noted in an earlier article for IPS (“Are Climate Summits a Waste of Time?”), the UN climate process is designed to help us make incremental progress, year after year, decade after decade. And it has. It may seem like the pace of change is too slow—and it often is—but the UN has kept the ball moving over many, many years, and can take credit for helping us forward much more than we realize. Isn’t Azerbaijan an oil producer? Why hold meetings on climate change in fossil fuel states? Yes, it is. In fact, many countries that have hosted the annual UN climate summit in the past have also been fossil fuel states. These include the UAE, UK, Poland, South Africa, India, and Indonesia. In fact, Poland (a major coal producer), has hosted the climate COPs three times! Why is this? The hosting of the COPs is decided by the relevant regional groupings of the UN. So, each region gets its turn every few years to decide who hosts. The fact is, many countries produce fossil fuels, and often these are the ones with the financial and organizational capacity to host large events like a UN summit. As we have argued in the past (“Global Cooperation on Climate Change: What Have We Achieved and What Needs to Happen Next?”), we believe hosts should be judged not on their fossil fuel status, but on whether the annual COP they host is a success. If we judge the hosts by what the UN summits achieve, then fossil fuel countries have a mixed record. COP29 was not a breakout success, but the recent COPs in Egypt and the UAE achieved a surprising breakthrough, with agreement on a loss and damage fund. Also, some of these fossil fuel producers are slowly transitioning their economies away from selling oil, coal and gas. Azerbaijan, for instance, is promoting its tourism sector. Are UN climate COPs still worth holding? Do they need to change? As mentioned above, we believe UN climate summits are worth it, as they have helped the world make significant progress over the past thirty years. That said, some people think the COPs need to change how they operate. For instance, there were 65,000 people at COP29, but only a few thousand were actually involved in the UN negotiations. Isn’t this a sign something needs to be done differently? We think the critics miss the point. While it’s true that the UN climate COPs have become large and unwieldy, they also serve many purposes. First, the world pays attention to these mega-events, which ratchet up the political pressure. Prime ministers, presidents, and other world leaders often attend, knowing the eyes of the world are on them. This, too, raises expectations and sometimes leads to better outcomes. Not only that, but the COPs are often teeming with other folks from every sector and country, all eager to talk about what they are doing, listen to others, and build networks, coalitions, and alliances. Sometimes, these lead to powerful “coalitions of the willing”. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) mentioned earlier is an example of this, as is the Global Methane Pledge, a coalition uniting 159 participating countries (and the European Commission) in pursuit of a goal to cut methane emissions 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. On other occasions, participants can generate new ideas that eventually end up in the formal UN negotiations. Recent examples include discussions on agriculture and water management. Currently, it appears as if climate change in the context of oceans and human health may soon be added to the formal discussions. Of course, the climate COPs could certainly be improved. For instance, the number of formal agenda items could be reduced, since the negotiations are now very complex. However, the UN COPs continue to serve an important function and should, in our opinion, include a wide range of stakeholders.

Credit: Umar Manzoor Shah/IPS The next COP is taking place in Belém, Brazil in November 2025. What’s on the agenda, and what needs to happen before then? The road to COP30 in Brazil lies through Bonn, Germany, which is the location for the annual preparatory meeting each June. UN climate watchers will be paying close attention to the two-week session in Bonn to see if we are on track to make any breakthroughs in Brazil. The key issues where observers would like to see progress at COP30 include: We would also like to see evidence at COP30 that the recently-created Loss and Damage Fund is starting to have an impact, and that the role of oceans in climate change mitigation and adaptation is being taken more seriously. Even though the situation is bad, is there still hope? Yes. Despite the recent bad news, we remain optimistic. History shows we have made positive strides already. We are convinced now is the time to double down on global, collaborative efforts to combat climate change, and that the UN COPs provide important, regular milestones to meet, review our progress, and strengthen our pledges. One piece of good news lost among all the big, bad headlines relates to the leadership at COP30. Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago has been chosen as president of COP30. He played a significant role in the Rio+20 negotiations and has been one of Brazil’s top civil servants for many years. His expertise when it comes to climate change and COPs is impressive. The appointment of such a consummate professional is a positive sign of how seriously the Brazilian government is taking its responsibilities as the COP30 host. Prof. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence have participated in UN environmental negotiations since the 1990s. They co-edited Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy: Profiles in Courage (Routledge, 2022). Their next book, Environmental Lobbying at the United Nations: A Guide to Protecting Our Planet, is due for release in June 2025.

Cool-headed Charlie Hempenstall drove Wesley into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup quarter-final claiming 18 points in their win over Belvedere College at Energia Park on Friday afternoon. The Leinster under-19s outhalf was a step ahead of everyone in engineering the first upset of the competition to make the last eight. Wesley hit the ground running from the off, working a smart lineout for Tom Burke to go over in the right corner. The touchline conversion proving no problem for Hempenstall. It wasn’t long before Belvedere captain Charlie Lyons was binned for an illegal tackle and Hempenstall sent Matthew Wystepek over on the right. Hempenstall found the posts from the touchline again for 14-0 in the 13th minute. He then rubbed salt into Belvedere’s wounds with a 17th minute penalty. David Gimore was away and a flashy attack ended with Hempenstall arrowing a kick for Wystepek to grab and ground for 22-0 in the 25th minute. Belvedere finally managed to gather their game, number eight Paul Dunne blasting off the base of a five-metre scrum for a badly needed try. The Ballinteer school’s quick, clean rucking was the secret to a multi-phase attack finished by prop Evan Caddow, joined by Hempenstall’s extras to make it 29-5 at the break. Belvedere blasted back into the game as their forwards upped the ante and their backs came alive. Lorcan Butler’s close-range burst and a similar effort from Cillian McCann delivered two quickfire tries, both converted by Jonathan Garrihy. The sense of desperation had dissolved as Garrihy was content to add a penalty from a promising position for 17 points in 18 minutes. Now, the pressure had shifted to Wesley' shoulders. It was then Hempenstall weaved a wonderful pattern for a phenomenal individual try which he also converted. Then was the calm after the storm. Another fluid move allowed fullback Max Colbert to stroll over on the right, Hempenstall adding the conversion. A late push from Belvedere saw replacement Eugene Isong claim their fourth try to reduce the deficit to make it a 16-point loss. WESLEY: M Colbert; M Wystepek, D Gilmore, N Heatley, J Duffy; C Hempenstall, J Freyne; E Caddow, T Burke, J Cullen, A Gordon, I Reid, L L’Estrange, S McMullin (capt), T Campbell.

Title: The Top Specialty PR Firms in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-31T17:00:51Z

In an era where perception is currency, specialty PR firms are the brokers of influence Why does specialty PR matter? Because in an economy driven by perception, those who control the narrative control the market. And in a country where culture and commerce are inextricably linked, they don’t just shape industries—they shape the world we live in. Specialty PR firms shape what people see, hear and believe. On a micro level, they dictate which restaurants are impossible to book, which hotels are suddenly the destination and which films, albums and IPOs dominate cultural and financial conversations. On a macro level, they steer industries, influence policy narratives and define what matters in public discourse. In an era where perception is indistinguishable from reality, these PR firms don’t manage visibility but manufacture it. Specialty firms operate with precision. They don’t waste time trying to make a finance executive “relatable” or an indie musician “mainstream.” They know exactly where influence lives and how to embed clients within the conversations that matter. A hospitality PR firm doesn’t just push a hotel—it builds mythology around it. A tech PR firm doesn’t just announce funding rounds—it positions a company as an innovator before the market even realizes it’s relevant. And this matters to everyone. The stories people engage with, the trends they adopt, the brands they trust—these aren’t accidents. Specialty PR firms ensure that what rises above the noise isn’t what’s loudest but what’s designed to dominate. In a world oversaturated with content, they filter. For better or worse, they decide what gets remembered. Looking into 2025, these are the best specialty PR firms in the categories that matter most to Observer. Nightlife and dining PR engineers desire. It’s the whisper campaign that turns a tucked-away speakeasy into a celebrity haunt, the strategic leaks that make a restaurant impossible to book before it even opens and the viral moment so perfectly executed that the cocktails are practically copyrighted. It’s knowing which influencers to plant near the DJ, which critics to invite (or mysteriously forget), how to position a new tasting menu as the next gastronomic revolution and how to spin a kitchen meltdown into “an off-night” rather than a full-blown disaster. Whether launching a buzzy rooftop lounge, securing a Michelin nod or keeping a legacy institution relevant in a fickle industry, PR defines the scene itself. In nightlife and dining, perception is currency. “Creativity drives success." — Co-Founder Eva Karagiorgas It’s been a delicious year for Ilana Alperstein and Eva Karagiorgas’ ten-year-old PR firm. In 2024, Mona Creative added nearly 100 new clients and saw 35 percent year-on-year growth, an impressive feat in an industry where trends move at the speed of a viral TikTok. Named agency of record for the iconic estiatorio Milos brand worldwide, the firm also won celebrated clients like H&H Bagels, Dominique Ansel Bakery and Acru from NA:EUN Hospitality―the team behind Atomix, hailed widely as one of the world’s best restaurants. Mona was at the center of the year’s most high-profile restaurant stories, overseeing the openings of Catch Hospitality's The Corner Store and Tao Group's Crane Club. Mona handled PR for two additions to Miami’s Design District: Nami Nori’s December expansion and the forthcoming opening of Matsuyoi. The agency remains deeply embedded in David Chang’s Momofuku empire, including his social media-famous Majordōmo in Los Angeles, which had a wildly successful NYC pop-up last year. They’re also behind the much-anticipated Kabawa and Bar Kabawa, opening in February in the former Ko Bar space, featuring a prix-fixe menu helmed by Paul Carmichael, Momofuku’s head of culinary development. Beyond restaurants, Mona’s influence extends across food media and publishing. They represent James Beard-winning cookbook author and TV personality Hawa Hassan, whose Vogue-covered wedding in April 2024 was as much a media event as a personal milestone. They also repped the March launch of two-time James Beard and Webby Award-winning Sporkful host Dan Pashman's first book, Anything’s Pastable. monacreative.co “Integrity is our north star. Telling things the way they are is always the best approach.” — Founder Hanna Lee Hanna Lee Communications dominated the hospitality PR game in 2024, with some of the year’s biggest dining and spirits stories tracing back to its team. Café Carmellini by Andrew Carmellini and Ghee Indian Kitchen by Niven Patel and Mohamed Alkassar both landed coveted James Beard Award semifinalist nods, a testament to HLC’s knack for positioning clients at the center of industry acclaim. The firm continued its streak of high-impact launches, including the new Locanda Verde at Hudson Yards, The Portrait Bar and a slate of top-tier venues spanning New York, Miami and beyond. Celebrating 21 years, Hanna Lee's global reach now extends from New York to Nairobi, championing brands that shape the future of hospitality, from luxury hotels to world-class bars, spirits brands and distilleries. The firm's PR playbook doesn’t just generate headlines—it crafts legacy. That strategy paid off with two PRNews Platinum Awards: Best Restaurant/F&B Campaign for Woody Creek Distillers’ William H. Macy Reserve Straight Rye Whiskey and Best Podcast for Hospitality Forward, now heading into its seventh season. Beyond press, HLC continues to invest in the industry’s future. HLC Meet the Media champions journalism’s evolving landscape, while New York Bartender Week—returning in November 2025—spotlights bartending as both an art form and economic force. hannaleecommunications.com “I encourage everyone on the team to know what the media writes, how they write and who they write for.” — Founder Steven Hall Attending an industry event with Steven Hall is like touring a city with its mayor. After nearly 30 years, Hall PR remains the gold standard for those seeking the spotlight in nightlife and dining, and the founder's stature as an industry guru continues to draw established and emerging clients. Operating as both a power broker and cultural translator, 2024 was a banner year for the firm, marked by a slew of high-profile openings, milestone anniversaries and the kind of deep-rooted industry relationships that make Hall PR an enduring force. Legacy clients Carmine’s and Virgil’s celebrated 35 and 30 years, respectively, while Simon Oren’s Chef Driven Group—Hall PR’s very first client—continued its expansion with Acadia and Sempre Oggi. Aquavit hit the decade mark of holding two Michelin stars, and Chef Vijay Kumar of Semma was named a James Beard semifinalist for Best Chef NYS. Hall PR opened Wayward Fare in Prospect Heights with Akhtar Nawab and debuted Mango Bay, an Afro-Caribbean hotspot helmed by rising star Chef London Chase. Hall opened Cesar, Chef Cesar Ramirez’s two-Michelin-star restaurant; YongChuan, the Sichuan/Ningbo Chinese spot; Lungi, a Sri Lankan/Southern Indian eatery; and Medium Rare, a steak-frites brand from D.C. Already this year, Hall opened Chez Fifi from Sushi Noz owners David and Josh Foulquier, which swiftly became one of Manhattan's most sought-after reservations. Another Hall PR client, The Bronze Owl, was instantly dubbed “Manhattan’s hottest new cocktail bar.” The firm also oversaw the debut of Nōksu, a fine-dining enclave hidden beneath the 32nd Street subway station, where grilled mackerel with brown butter and squab with gochujang agrodolce is redefining underground luxury. Expanding its global influence, Hall PR signed on with Japanese food brand Kayanoya while continuing to broker licensing deals for Tokyo’s Garde properties, bringing Japanese brands stateside and vice versa. And in Harlem, Melba Wilson’s unstoppable empire is now part of the Hall PR family. hallpr.com "A company’s growth is directly tied to making people feel valued and dedicating time to cultivating strong leaders. When you invest in capable, forward-thinking leaders, you ignite a culture of innovation, accountability and unstoppable passion." — Founder Rachel Harrison In 2024, Rachel Harrison's eponymous PR agency secured Michelin Keys for Eastwind Hotel & Bar, NoMad London, Wildflower Farms, Auberge Resorts Collection and Crossroads while positioning Chef Dominique Crenn as a media sensation with placements in Bon Appétit and Cherry Bombe. The firm’s strategic storytelling landed Thailand as the filming location for The White Lotus season three, generating over 3 billion media impressions. In nightlife, RHC launched venues like Ànimo! and Revelie and signed legendary NYC institution Raoul's ahead of its 50th anniversary. RHC further solidified its industry impact with the "Manhattan Manhattan" campaign for Great Jones Distilling Co. and its comms strategy to ensure Superbueno was ranked #27 on the World's 50 Best Bars list (and #2 on North America's 50 Best Bars). "We’ve been leveling up year after year," Harrison says to Observer of the culture she's built. "Our low turnover allows us to continuously nurture and train a team of smart, dynamic and wildly creative professionals. Watching this team evolve into some of the most talented, visionary creatives I’ve ever worked with is something I’m immensely proud of—and it’s exactly what fuels our success." At the tail end of 2024, RHC brought on notable bars, including award-winning Sip & Guzzle and Press Club in Washington D.C. Blending trend-savvy editorial perspectives with strategic media outreach, RHC continues to shape the conversation in dining and nightlife. wearerhc.com “There will always be an arsenal of PR tactics to deploy, but those aren’t the campaigns you phone home about.” — Founder Gia Vecchio Foxglove has always punched above its weight in nightlife and dining PR, but 2024 was the year it leveled up in every direction. Gia Vecchio’s seven-year-old firm—which maintains a long and ever-growing client list of restaurants, chefs, bakeries, books and indie hotels—doubled its team, adding NYC industry heavyweight Liza Prijatel Thors (formerly of The Door) as vice president. It also expanded operations to Texas, picking up an award-winning roster of restaurants across Dallas, Houston and Austin. The firm’s expertise now extends far beyond restaurants, securing OpenTable as a major client and becoming the agency of record for food and beverage at Wynn hotels. Meanwhile, Foxglove’s influence in the luxury hospitality space continues to grow, snagging Cape & Kantary Thailand—two luxury, five-star properties—and taking on two of celebrity chef Laurent Tourondel's restaurants within his Mid-Atlantic expansion. Foxglove also deepened its authority in beverage and craft cocktails, signing Lunazul Tequila under the Heaven Hill portfolio and top-tier bar groups from Dear Irving to Experimental Group. The stately flower may have elegant spikes, but in the PR game, Vecchio's Foxglove is proving itself just as sharp. Foxglove isn’t slowing down in 2025, stacking high-profile wins that further cement its dominance in hospitality. The firm is leading the charge for Wonder’s ambitious Mid-Atlantic expansion, working to position the on-demand dining disruptor as a category-defining brand. In the spirits world, Foxglove has signed on with Cooper Spirits, handling several of its most esteemed labels, including Slow & Low. Meanwhile, the firm is bringing the adrenaline-fueled luxury of F1 Arcade to Philadelphia, ensuring the immersive racing experience makes a splash in a city primed for high-energy entertainment. Proving its track record in the industry’s upper echelon, Foxglove played a pivotal role in eight campaigns for 2025 James Beard Award-nominated restaurants and chefs, turning culinary excellence into headline-making moments. foxglovecommunications.com Luxury Travel PR sells fantasies. It’s the campaign that transforms a secluded island retreat into the next jet-set destination, the carefully placed feature that makes a $50,000-a-night safari lodge feel essential before the season’s bookings vanish and the media strategy that positions a heritage château as the discreet escape for power players. It’s securing glossy spreads, curating who gets invited to that ultra-exclusive press trip and ensuring the right whispers about a resort’s guest list make the rounds. Every detail—from the first embargoed preview to the last perfectly staged Instagram post—turns geo-tags into status symbols. In luxury travel, PR isn’t really about visibility but making sure the right people see it and everyone else wants to. “Empathy isn’t just a value—it’s a strength. When people feel cared for, solutions often follow naturally.” — Account Manager Ashley Mir Imagine PR had a powerhouse 2024, expanding its global footprint with a roster that reads like a high-end travel wishlist. Gabriele and Andreas Sappok's firm added Walk Japan, the country’s premier walking tour operator, and eriro, an ultra-luxe Austrian Alps retreat reachable only by cable car. Austria’s Forsthofgut, famed for its sprawling mountain spa, and Portugal’s W Algarve, home to a mix of luxury suites and residences, further cemented Imagine’s reputation for representing exclusive hospitality. The firm’s expansion into Africa included Stanley Safaris, a boutique operator crafting bespoke journeys across the continent and South Africa’s highly anticipated Spier Hotel, set to open in 2025 with a village-style design in the Cape Winelands. Switzerland’s legendary Tschuggen Collection and Iceland’s Sky Lagoon, with its newly opened Turf House inspired by Viking architecture, rounded out Imagine’s deepening influence in experiential luxury. In Florence, Imagine took on the historic Hotel Brunelleschi, built within the city’s oldest standing tower, while also securing The Broadway Collection as a client. But the year’s biggest coup? MJ The Musical—its first standalone show, with a global PR strategy positioning it as an essential NYC travel experience. For a firm that has long blended travel with cultural cachet, 2024 was the year Imagine PR proved that high-end hospitality and world-class entertainment belong in the same conversation. imagine-team.com Gizem Ozcelik continues to parlay out-of-the-park creativity with an intensive media strategy to produce game-changing client results. That approach is what led hospitality disruptor Generator and Freehand Hotels to seek the agency for representation across their portfolio and their foray into third-party management with the opening of the iconic Paramount Hotel in Times Square, focusing on boosting the profiles of brand leadership. GO PR will also spearhead Generator's 30th-anniversary efforts in 2025. Ozcelik has been working with the brand since 2016, helping to single-handedly change the perception of the hotel market in the U.S. and set the stage for the Freehand acquisition. In 2024, GO PR also expanded its wellness business, winning Naturopathica spas, tasked to to double the brand’s footprint in 2025 with openings in Aspen and Phoenix, as well as the Ballers social-sports brand from former Fitler Club Founders. The agency continues to add to its tentpole of boutique hotel launches; for the debut of Philadelphia’s indie Hotel Anna & Bel, GO PR secured over six billion impressions spanning 200 hits, Ozcelik tells Observer. go-pr.com “Sometimes the most creative ideas may not deliver immediate results, but will support the long-term goals." — Founder Melanie Brandman Melanie Brandman's eponymous PR agency hit its highest revenue in history last year, a feat that’s particularly impressive considering the hospitality industry’s post-pandemic reckoning. Along with a long list of stalwart accounts like COMO Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton properties, The Brandman Agency had a string of powerhouse wins in 2024, including the Peninsula Hotels’ global portfolio and IHG’s Luxury and Lifestyle brands (Six Senses). Brandman also unveiled Carlton Cannes, a Regent Hotel, with a major activation at the Cannes Film Festival. The agency orchestrated La Mamounia’s 100th-anniversary celebration, transforming the Moroccan landmark into a media magnet, drawing coverage in Vogue, Condé Nast Traveler and The Financial Times with over 54 million impressions. More than 35 percent of Brandman's clients have been with the agency for six years or more, including La Mamounia (16 years), Rome Cavalieri and Raffles Singapore (8 years each) and Experience Scottsdale (12 years). The Peninsula New York’s refurbishment campaign—complete with an exclusive Vogue100 rooftop event—showcases how Brandman curates moments that redefine brands. brandmanagency.com "My senior team appreciated me walking away, knowing we would get better business instead. That's the advantage of owning my own agency and being smart about the long game in PR.” — Founder Laura Davidson In an industry where client loyalty is rare, Laura Davidson Public Relations (LDPR) has built nearly 25 years of staying power. The firm has held onto Abercrombie & Kent, Paws Up in Montana and VisitScotland for almost 20 years and the Aman for 10. In just last year, LDPR added Park Hyatt New York, Windstar Cruises and Orient Express Italy, Melbourne/Visit Victoria, Andaz Miami Beach, NYC’s Sonesta Hotels, Grand Hyatt Scottsdale, the Grand Hotel Fasano in Lake Garda Italy and Sundance, Utah. Speaking with Observer, Laura Davidson stresses the importance of not chasing every opportunity but cultivating the right ones. The firm's refusal to take on business that treats agencies as vendors rather than partners has only strengthened its culture. The result? A record $4.5 million in revenue for 2024, with projections to hit $5 million in 2025. Beyond traditional tactics, LDPR has mastered the art of viral activations, from VisitScotland’s Coo Cam, a live feed of Highland cows, to Paws Up Resort’s partnership with Fender, blending luxury travel with music. Campaigns like the “Election Recovery Package” for O2 Beach Club in Barbados drive bookings while keeping the narrative fresh. ldpr.com "As we evolve, we are increasingly drawn to brands that embody an entrepreneurial spirit—those that ignite and embrace creativity while having the ability to transform ideas into action. Focusing our work on clients that are agile and collaborative allows our agency to do what we do best and bring to life original, creative and thoughtful ideas that make an impact for our clients." — Founder Meg Connolly Meg Connolly Communications (MCC) has long set the bar in luxury travel PR, and 2024 only reinforced its dominance. This year’s new wins read like a curated itinerary of the world’s most coveted destinations: Meadowood Napa Valley, The Marbella Club and three Auberge Resorts Collection properties, including The Dunlin, Primland and the highly anticipated Collegio alla Querce in Florence. The firm’s deep relationships are as much a calling card as its press coups. Longtime clients like Maybourne, The St. Regis New York and Pulitzer Amsterdam showcase MCC’s ability to retain the industry’s top names, while its campaigns—like the Vogue feature on the ultra-luxe private island escape, Islas Secas and The Dunlin’s buzzy debut—prove its mastery of cultural cachet. MCC’s deep network ensures launches land in all the right places, from Wes Gordon and Indre Rockefeller’s social feeds to the pages of Condé Nast Traveler. MCC has also made bold moves, walking away from corporate hospitality in favor of more entrepreneurial, creatively driven brands. “We are intentional about who we work with, even at the risk of growth,” Connolly tells Observer. The result? A client roster defined by prestige, impact and longevity. mcc-pr.com Entertainment PR keeps the right names in the headlines and the wrong ones buried in legal memos. It’s crafting Oscar campaigns that turn solid performances into “career-defining,” feeding blind items to DeuxMoi to keep a star relevant and ensuring that a flopped album or box office disaster somehow gets framed as “ahead of its time.” It’s the whisper network that decides which actor gets the GQ cover and which gets quietly sunset, and the media rollout transforms a niche indie musician into a pop culture force. It's turning a debut album into a cultural moment and a limited theater run into a must-see event. From stadium tours to arthouse films and red carpet premieres to sold-out residencies, entertainment PR is about influence, positioning talent and productions at the center of the cultural zeitgeist. "If you can’t picture it, don’t pitch it. If you can’t visualize an artist on a cover or a show, don’t waste anyone's time." — Founder Steve Martin Nasty Little Man founder Steve Martin’s deft handling of Dave Grohl’s latest headline was hailed by The New York Times as "a lesson in crisis control"—though at this point, navigating the rock PR high-wire is just business as usual. The firm’s latest run of campaigns reads like a masterclass in cultural impact: Paul McCartney’s Eyes of the Storm photography exhibition made its U.S. debut to rapturous press; Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us dominated the indie conversation; and St. Vincent’s All Born Screaming landed her a WNBA national anthem performance—a first, even for Martin, who’s been at this game for a while. Of course, loyalty is the real currency in rock and roll, and Martin’s client roster proves it. Beastie Boys (31 years), Foo Fighters (29 years), Radiohead (24 years), Arcade Fire (17 years) and LCD Soundsystem (16 years) still trust Nasty to keep them at the forefront. Metallica, another longtime client, isn’t just selling out stadiums but shaping real-world change through All Within My Hands, the band’s philanthropic foundation. Now in its sixth year, the Metallica Scholars Initiative has grown from 10 schools to 60, spanning all 50 states and Guam, pumping $10 million into workforce education, disaster relief and food insecurity initiatives—because nothing screams rock and roll like actually making a difference. nastylittleman.com "Working in theater is a gift. Not only is creativity appreciated, it’s expected." — Co-Founder Molly Barnett Molly Barnett and Chelsea Nachman’s theater-PR firm scored Broadway’s biggest coup with Oh, Mary!, a huge and unlikely sensation that theater critic David Cote dubbed "a splendidly nasty farce you will not want to miss." Grapevine Public Relations also reps long-running hit & Juliet, the only new musical of the 2022-23 Broadway season that recouped; highly anticipated new Idina Menzel vehicle Redwood; Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson, who made her Broadway debut as composer of The Notebook; Cyndi Lauper, for all her theater projects; and playwright Theresa Rebeck, Lauper’s collaborator on next year’s Working Girl. Theater photographer Jenny Anderson is among Grapevine's newest clients; her book, The In-Between, will be released in April. Barnett tells Observer that 2024 was the firm's best year ever, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth. Amanda Marie Miller, who joined Barnett and Nachman in 2023, turning it into a three-person firm, tells Observer she's thrilled to work alongside the best in the business. "Grapevine puts an immense amount of energy and care into each client," Miller says. "It is an honor to work with such outstanding partners." grapevineprny.com "We see pressure as an opportunity to do our best work." — Founder Sheila Feren Thurston This insider’s insider entertainment PR firm, founded by longtime publicist Sheila Feren Thurston, just marked its 30th anniversary. The agency reps marquee brands, including Amazon’s Prime Video, AMC Networks, Disney Entertainment Television, Audible, TBS, Hulu and STARZ. Feren and her team have had a hand in launching shows including Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead Universe, along with recent hits like Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Palm Royale and Slow Horses. AMC Networks has been a client for two decades, too. For Project Healthy Minds, whose mission is to destigmatize the topic of mental health, FerenComm veered from its entertainment roots to handle the non-profit’s annual New York gala and World Mental Health Day Festival in October. ferencomm.com "Crisis is an opportunity to live your values and demonstrate what you truly stand for." — Co-CEOs Amanda Silverman, Christine Su, Meredith O'Sullivan & Sarah Rothman Veterans of Observer’s PR Power List, this celebrity and entertainment heavyweight gained more star power in 2024. In November, The Lede Company opened a Nashville office to house its new music division, whose clients include Sabrina Carpenter, Post Malone, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, Rosalia, Shakira and A$AP Rocky. Co-founders Sarah Rothman, Amanda Silverman, Meredith O'Sullivan and Christine Su are growing the company's London office with an eye on even bigger European business. The agency’s new events practice will expand on Lede's work for clients like Louis Vuitton, Thom Browne and Coach. Hennessy grew its mandate with The Lede Company for comms, talent partnerships, influencer marketing and social. Among 2024’s big hires: Lede’s Chief Impact Officer Jackie Murphy, formerly Edelman’s managing director of brand, purpose and impact. Oh, and its ongoing clients include Cynthia Erivo, Zoe Saldana, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. The company continues to represent corporate and brand clients such as Audi, YouTube, Paramount and The North Face. As a strategic partner to Comcast NBCUniversal, Lede worked closely with them on the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. ledecompany.com "Genuine enthusiasm and passion are a critical priority when advocating for our projects. We also care about balancing our relationships with respect, trust, compassion…and a sense of humor is essential." — Founder Matt Polk It’s been an award-winning year for Matt Polk’s mighty theater-PR agency; with 26 competitive Tony Awards in 2024, Polk & Co clients won 12, or nearly half the awards bestowed. The firm’s clients also earned a total of 62 Tony Award nominations, including some categories with multiple nominees. Along the way, Polk and Co signed marquee clients, including Stranger Things: The First Shadow, co-produced by Netflix and Sonia Friedman; Alicia Keys’ Broadway musical Hell’s Kitchen; the stage adaptation of Prince’s Purple Rain; and Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures’ Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Hollywood’s Jon M. Chu. And its campaigns for blockbuster shows, including Gypsy (“A once-in-a-lifetime event! Top-to-bottom perfect”), Maybe Happy Ending ("the best, most beautiful, innovational and original musical"), Death Becomes Her (“Savagely funny. Wildly entertaining. A virtually perfect musical comedy") and the Merrily We Roll Along revival, have helped win both headlines and critical ovations. polkandco.com “Analytics matter less to us than bringing culture-shifting art to a bigger audience in new ways. If a story is seen or read by only 100 people but it’s the right 100 influential people, that can cause a ripple effect and build a brand with a stronger foundation.” — Partner Dana Meyerson Chappell Roan’s Lollapalooza performance shattered records this summer, drawing the largest day crowd in the festival’s 30-plus-year history—a feat Billboard hailed while naming her the fourth-biggest star of the year. It’s a massive win for the artist but also for Biz 3, the PR agency led by founder Kathryn Frazier and partner Dana Meyerson, who have been guiding Roan’s rise since 2022. 2024 wasn’t just about Roan. Biz 3 delivered headline moments for breakout artists like Victoria Monet, Jorja Smith, Jessie Reyez, Caroline Polachek, Sudan Archives, Tommy Richman, TOKiMONSTA, Yves Tumor, Robert Glasper, Daniel Nigro and Remi Wolf, while continuing to shepherd superstars such as the weeknd, Lil Baby, Lil Yachty, Daft Punk, Skrillex, Justice and Killer Mike. Singer-songwriter RAYE, a client since 2023, made history by becoming the first artist to take home six Brit Awards in a single night. Three 2025 Grammy nominations make RAYE the first artist in history to be simultaneously nominated for both Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year—plus Best Engineered Album, for engineering Lucky Daye's Algorithm. Although the year is young, Biz 3 has already welcomed Leon Thomas, Jensen McRae, Nemahsis, Quadeca, Scowl, Hi-Tech, Spill Tab, Avalon, Saint Levant, Elyanna and Dora Jar. biz3.net New Tech PR sells the future—whether or not it actually works. It’s the breathless product launch that makes a marginal software update sound revolutionary, the keynote speech that convinces investors a PowerPoint prototype is worth billions and the embargoed “leak” that sends preorders through the roof. It’s about keeping founders mythologized, venture rounds oversubscribed and regulatory scrutiny at bay. When innovation turns to scandal—think mass layoffs, privacy breaches or vaporware exposés—it’s the pivot to “lessons learned” and a LinkedIn essay on leadership. In tech PR, hype isn’t just a tool—it’s the entire business model. Whether broadcasting the latest A.I. breakthrough, keeping B2B SaaS from sounding like a spreadsheet factory or ensuring regulators stay just confused enough. This is PR at its most strategic—because in enterprise, perception is revenue. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." — Co-Founders Greg Mondshein & Becky Honeyman For Greg Mondshein and Becky Honeyman’s eight-year-old SourceCode Communications, winning clients like Writer, Sonatype, Sovos, Vultr, Scribd and a Fortune 10 technology company was the icing on the cake for 2024. The firm’s first GrowthSource event drew attendees who were able to network with peers and build a small community of NYC marketers to lean on during a time when the industry is constantly shifting. Their first-ever Global Executive Leadership team was established with UK Managing Director Giles Peddy, EVP Head of Client Services Christa Conte and EVP Head of Technology and Innovation Kevin Dulaney. "We never envisaged building an industry coalition but having worked in an industry that sees fewer minority and female leaders and founders, we wanted to try to mitigate this disparity," Mondshein and Honeyman tell Observer of The Diversity Marketing Consortium, a coalition of four marketing agencies that have pledged millions in pro-bono comms, marketing and design services to support diverse founders, in partnership with Harlem Capital Partners. "We will always invest in equity and inclusion." SourceCode’s revenue was up 15 percent last year with 30 percent organic growth thanks to the work of the recently promoted U.S. Managing Director Kristen Stippich. SourceCode has been recognized with 21 industry awards, became B Corp certified, launched a new website, expanded its service offerings with multiple new products and continues to see growth in its London office with an expanding team. All in all, SourceCode is ready to take the bull by the horns in 2025. sourcecodecommunications.com "Time and time again, we see acts of honesty pay off by leaps and bounds. There’s no need to concoct smear campaigns and cover-ups a la Justin Baldoni—just own up to what you’ve done and share how you’re going to be better." — Founder Bruno Solari Leading-edge companies that bridge tech and healthcare are among the change-making clients at Bruno Solari’s two-year-old shop. They include Suki, which provides A.I. voice solutions for healthcare; Avandra, the largest federated network for de-identified medical image data; Tuva Health, the world's first open-source healthcare data transformation platform; and virtual nutrition-counseling startup Culina Health. Big consumer brands are also on the roster; SolComms handled Apothékary’s Ulta.com launch and Shiseido investment; sustainable cleaning brand Blueland’s Pods are Plastic launch, where the brand supported the introduction of a bill to ban the sale of detergent pods in New York City; and the viral bag brand Bogg’s entrance at Target. Growing in corporate communications, the firm partnered with Daniel Lubetzky, the billionaire KIND Snacks founder, to announce him as the newest Shark on Shark Tank. In 2024, SolComms further established its leadership team, elevating Isabella Morreale to Associate Vice President of HealthTech, Kylee Kaetzel to Associate Vice President of Consumer, Elizabeth Snyder to Director of Digital Health and Natalie Valicenti to Director of Operations. For this 30-person firm, 2025 is all about vertical growth. The agency recently signed a slew of big tech and A.I. companies outside of healthcare. It also built a robust creator marketing team, offering consumer brands earned and paid influencer campaigns, as well as paid podcast and newsletter partnerships. "We’re human-first in everything we do," Solari tells Observer. "More times than not, the client is choosing the people—not the capabilities or experience. Our clients view us as counselors, strategic thought partners, and at times, even therapists—and I’m so proud of that." solcomms.co "Agility means never changing the goal, but always being willing to shift the strategy." — Founder & CEO Tiffany Guarnaccia Adtech, retail media, climate tech and A.I.-powered businesses are the categories driving incredible growth at Tiffany Guarnaccia’s 12-year-old agency. Among last year's achievements was the rebrand and relaunch of Caddis, a global advisory firm specializing in the development of data centers to house A.I. infrastructure and working with Salesforce Ventures-backed startups like AutogenAI, a bid-writing tool that's been dubbed one of the U.K.'s most promising new artificial intelligence companies. In 2024, Kite Hill PR helped The Home Depot rebrand its retail media division to Orange Apron Media, in an upfronts-style event showcasing its new offerings. In the very hot climate-tech space, Kite Hill represents players such as Proteus Ocean Group, a company spearheading the creation of a first-of-its-kind underwater space station off the coast of Curaçao. "PROTEUS" will advance marine science, climate research and ocean exploration through long-term habitation, state-of-the-art labs and live-streamed educational programming in partnership. Sapphire Technologies, a leader in energy recovery systems for hydrogen and natural gas, is another Kite Hill Client. Last year, Sapphire Technologies entered the Nigerian market through a partnership with Horizon Shores Nigeria Ltd., deploying turboexpander technology to convert wasted pressure energy into clean electricity—marking its first African venture and a step toward advancing Nigeria’s sustainable energy transition. "We value agility," Guarnaccia tells Observer. "Which means earned media isn't always our primary focus." kitehillpr.com "The elite independent creative agencies producing game-changing work that wins coveted Cannes Lions lack the financial resources to stand out amidst lavish displays. This irony was not lost on our clients, who became increasingly vocal about this under-representation." — Co-Founders Hollie Rapello & Matt Van Hoven Raven Public Relations’ niche is PR for advertising agencies, which means the firm’s work also touches scores of big client brands―think Amazon, Southwest Airlines, Diageo, Molson Coors, Lenovo and many more. Raven spotlighted Arnold’s work for Progressive, earning its “Dr. Rick” campaign huge media attention. For Tombras, Raven helped publicize BarkAir, the dog airline created for Tombras client Bark. Raven served as an official partner of Cannes Lions, launching Indie Beach—an event that brought together 13 competitive agencies in a hallmark moment for the creative industry. "There are a number of principles guiding our business (resilience, empathy, rigor, pragmatism, integrity, innovation, etc.), but the one we feel has helped us more than any other is autonomy," fo-founders Hollie Rapello and Matt Van Hoven tell Observer. "It’s the cornerstone of our business, and it truly shapes every aspect of it." With eight consecutive years of double-digit growth, Rapello and Van Hoven's PR firm now represents major creative agencies from four of the five global ad holding companies and the most renowned independents. And in the biggest moment of the year for advertisers, The Super Bowl, Raven clients will be well represented. ravenpublicrelations.com "Conventional wisdom says clients always come first, but we invert that by prioritizing the needs of reporters. By focusing on what the media values, we ultimately serve the needs of our clients most effectively." — President Evan Strome High10 closed out 2024 on a high note, adding Bloomberg Media and Hearst to an already heavyweight roster of current and former media clients that includes The Ankler, The Hollywood Reporter, The Hill, Ad Age, Adweek, Billboard, The Economist, HuffPo, Grist, The New Republic, New York Daily News, Telemundo, Yahoo!, Yahoo! Finance and The Wrap. The firm also delivered standout results for Aspen Digital, a nonpartisan program of the Aspen Institute and Kelvin, a climate-tech startup. 2025 marks High10's 15th year, and the agency's influence shows no signs of slowing under CEO Lisa Dallos and President Evan Strome. At Web Summit in November, High10 client and Managing Partner of Klaris Law Ed Klaris tackled the battle between A.I. and intellectual property in a conversation with The Guardian's Dan Milmo, while The Ankler's Janice Min—let’s be honest, it's Min’s Ankler—joined Axios’ Sara Fisher and Lucy Blakiston of Shit You Should Care About to dissect the ever-mutating media landscape. "Every client has the potential to operate as a media company," Dallos tells Observer. "Everything we do is rooted in building authentic connections, respecting the editorial process, and understanding what makes a good story." With a client list that reads like a who's who of media and a knack for steering the conversation in all the right rooms, High10 is setting the stage for the next big chapter. high10media.com Financial Services PR is less about explaining numbers than making them feel inevitable. It’s the carefully crafted earnings call that turns “significant losses” into “strategic recalibration,” the jargon-laden press release that ensures no one actually understands why a stock tanked and the analyst whisper campaign that transforms a floundering fintech into “the next great disruptor.” It’s about keeping CEOs on CNBC when things are good and off the front page when they’re not. Whether it's hyping a blockbuster IPO, massaging a bank failure or making hedge funds sound less like casinos, financial PR is high-stakes storytelling—because perception, in this business, is value. "We frequently advise our clients that they do not have a PR challenge; they have a business challenge. When the delta between business reality and rhetoric widens, so too does reputational risk." — Partner & New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley Brunswick continues to lead M&A communications worldwide. In 2024, the firm worked on 295 transactions globally worth a total of $583 billion, including 26 publicly disclosed activist defense engagements with an aggregate market cap of $583 billion. High-profile engagements last year included advising the Special Committee of Paramount on its $8.4 billion sale to Skydance Media and Ari Emanuel’s Endeavor on its $10 billion sale to Silver Lake. Henry Timms, former President and CEO of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, joined Brunswick this summer as group CEO based in New York alongside Nik Deogun (CEO of the Americas) and Jonathan Doorley (New York office head). On the West Coast, Mohamed Younis, formerly Gallup’s editor-in-chief, joined as Global Head of Insight; and Christine Schirmer, ex-Pinterest and Apple, joined to expand technology sector expertise. “Sir Alan Parker, our Chairman, frequently reminds us to ‘never get between the client and the footlights.’ This quote perfectly summarizes our firm’s deep commitment to client service but also our culture of discretion," Partner and New York Office Head Jonathan Doorley tells Observer. "We also frequently refer to the “One-firm, firm”—it is a core part of our culture." Brunswick continues to deepen its D.C. presence on both sides of the aisle with the recent additions of Jim Bognet, a Republican campaign manager and former Congressional candidate and Kate Bedingfield, President Biden’s former White House Communications Director. brunswickgroup.com “We provide direct, unvarnished counsel, no matter the client, context, or audience." — Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter In 2024, Gasthalter advised on some of the most complex and high-stakes situations while continuing to support the profile-raising efforts of its global client base. This now 30+-person boutique agency supported clients across investment management, digital assets and blockchain, A.I. and compute, venture capital, real estate and others on reputation management and profile-raising campaigns. Further, the firm advised on significant M&A and other transactions, proxy contests, litigation support, regulatory investigations and management succession matters. Gasthalter ranked #2 in Bloomberg’s 2024 Global Activism League Tables, advising a range of clients, including Mantle Ridge in its campaign against Air Products and Chemicals, Barington Capital Group in its campaign against Macy’s and Jana Partners in its campaign against Lamb Weston, among others. "The question we constantly ask ourselves is whether we are able to achieve maximum impact," Managing Partner Jonathan Gasthalter tells Observer. "There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and that is how we train our people.” gasthalter.com "We’re firm about never lying to or trying to spin a journalist, and if a potential client’s values don’t align with ours, we’ll walk away. We always try to understand the pressures others face and where they’re coming from. This may sound corny or trite, but it's key to our business and success." — Founder Richard Dukas In a landscape where many agencies focus on keeping clients out of the headlines, Dukas Linden (DLPR) ensures they own them. Over the past year, the firm has expanded its blue-chip roster, securing as well as growing major accounts with Raymond James, Citizens Bank, Neuberger Berman and Evercore, while the firm’s growing partnership with the Private Equity Women Investor Network (PEWIN) underscores its commitment to shaping financial industry narratives. DLPR works closely with PEWIN leadership to elevate the organization’s visibility and provide strategic communications training for female executives in private equity, venture capital and private credit. DLPR’s longstanding relationships speak volumes: It has helped steer Neuberger Berman’s public perception for seven years, transforming its reputation from a wealth manager to a diversified asset giant with $450 billion in AUM. The firm also manages the high-profile communications strategy for ARK-Invest, ensuring Cathie Wood’s innovation-focused firm remains dominant in market conversations while mitigating brand misconceptions. Additionally, DLPR has led messaging for Raymond James Investment Management, seamlessly integrating corporate rebranding into media, executive positioning and thought leadership initiatives. "We faced an unusual challenge when Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC," Executive Vice President Stephanie Dressler tells Observer, reflecting on how the firm approached one of the most unique challenges in the last year. "Several of our clients simultaneously launched funds, along with other, much larger firms, including BlackRock. Since DLPR creates dedicated teams for each client, we were able to implement differentiated launch strategies for each and avoid client conflicts." As a bonus, DLPR boasts a four-person executive management team with an average tenure of 13 years. Five other executives have been with the agency for an average of a decade, and five more have been at DLPR for an average of seven years, founder Richard Dukas tells Observer. dlpr.com "A company we worked with was navigating a Chapter 11 case and needed to announce going-out-of-business sales for many stores without creating the impression they were liquidating entirely. Instead of sticking to the usual playbook, we took a bold, proactive approach. We planned ahead, preparing the CEO to deliver the story. The message was clear: the company had a solid plan, real value and a future worth investing in. This narrative shifted perceptions and paved the way for a successful sale. Today, the company is thriving—a testament to the power of decisive leadership, creative storytelling, and rethinking traditional approaches." — Founder & CEO Jon Henes C Street Advisory Group, the boutique firm launched by Jon Henes in 2021, has rapidly become the go-to for companies navigating financial distress, reputation crises and political headwinds. In 2024 alone, the firm secured 40 new clients—including Bed Bath & Beyond, David’s Bridal, Ted Baker Canada, National CineMedia and Barnes & Noble Education—bringing its total to 67 new clients in just 24 months. The firm’s momentum earned it Communications Firm of the Year from M&A Advisors and a top ranking from The Deal for its strategic work in Chapter 11 cases and out-of-court transactions. C Street also deepened its public affairs practice while expanding its footprint to include New York, Chicago and Toronto. "Creativity and results go together," Managing Director Luke Wolf tells Observer. "It’s not about being creative for its own sake but about driving meaningful, measurable outcomes." "Teamwork is in our DNA," Managing Director Whitney Fogelberg adds. With 16 new hires last year—including the addition of Michael Frishberg as President—C Street is scaling fast. And 2025 is already off to a strong start, with five new clients signed in January alone. For a firm built on discretion and high-stakes strategy, its rise has been anything but quiet. thecstreet.com Bad news in business is good for Kekst CNC, which this year handled high-profile situations like Franchise Group’s Chapter 11 filing―its brands included Vitamin Shoppe―as well as bankruptcy communications for Party City, True Value Hardware and others. It wasn’t all doom and gloom, though. Kekst oversaw comms for Landbridge’s IPO; shares in the energy-development company surged on their first day of trading. The firm also opened its first office in Saudi Arabia and developed an A.I. tool with Oxford University to analyze the impact of how executives speak. kekstcnc.com Crisis Reputation Management is the art of spinning disaster into a mere “unfortunate misunderstanding.” It’s about knowing when to deny, when to grovel and when to throw an intern under the bus (joking!). The right crisis team can turn a corporate meltdown into a “bold new direction,” a CEO’s scandal into a “deeply personal journey of growth,” and a brand boycott into a limited-edition marketing opportunity. It’s less about truth and more about timing—knowing which journalists will play ball, which headlines can be buried and when to pivot from “no comment” to a tearful redemption tour. "Our most unconventional approach? Working with the media rather than avoiding them." — Founding Partner Ed Hammond Just 18 months after its founding by an A-team of comms pros and a former journalist, Collected Strategies has served more than 100 clients, outperforming expectations despite a slow M&A market. Founding Partners Scott Bisang, Jim Golden, Jude Gorman, Nick Lamplough, Ed Hammond and Dan Moore recently hired the firm's 20th employee (senior CNBC producer Patrick Manning) and capped 2024 by ranking in the top five of Bloomberg’s IR/PR Advisers for U.S. companies facing shareholder activists and in the top 10 of The Deal M&A League Tables. Among recent headline-making assignments: Masonite’s $3.9 billion sale to Owens Corning, Cigna’s $3.7 billion sale of its Medicare Advantage business, Sekisui House’s $4.9 billion acquisition of MDC Holdings, HireRight’s go private to General Atlantic and Stone Point Capital for $1.7 billion and Ambrx’s $2 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. In the hostile M&A world, the firm counseled Vanda Pharmaceuticals and Teoxane. In activism, Collected Strategies worked with dozens of companies facing private and public pressure against top activists like Trian, Starboard Value and Elliott Management, and is currently helping Matthews International against Barington Capital in a proxy contest. In restructuring, they advised on the bankruptcies of Red Lobster, Curo Group Holdings Corp. and CareMax. "Relationship building is such an individual pursuit, but our general rule is to stay engaged and do it honestly," Lamplough tells Observer. "You'll get found out and burned out trying to fake it." The firm's ongoing strategic advisory work—managing crises, reputational challenges and raising company and executive profiles with investors and the media—features big names like Lucid, Pernod Ricard, Hershey’s, Affirm, RingCentral, Exact Sciences, Carter’s, Genuine Parts, Top Rank Boxing, Bluestone Equity Partners and Element Solutions. collectedstrategies.com "We 'leaned in' instead of 'leaning out,' as conventional crisis communications wisdom recommends. We crafted an open letter to guests, a transparent, social-first strategy that clarified the restructuring process, reassured loyal customers, and countered misconceptions about the brand’s future—all without traditional media engagement." — Founder & CEO Michael Kempner “We’re in a reputation economy and a state of permacrisis,” MikeWorldWide founder and CEO Michael Kempner tells Observer. Both have been good for this formidable independent firm in its 35th year. Among MWW’s developments in 2024: A burgeoning corporate reputation practice (whose clients, not surprisingly, insist on anonymity), proprietary developments in A.I., a soon-to-open Mexico City office and expansion in London. Ongoing clients include Deloitte Global, StubHub, Subaru and the International Council of Shopping Centers. So far in 2025, MWW has been named the agency of record for Mattress Firm, and its campaign for Red Lobsters's Chapter 11 filing was shortlisted in the PRWeek Awards for "Best in Crisis." Kempner credits starting with the fundamental audience questions ("Why should I trust you? Why do you matter to me?") is how MWW creates imaginative, purpose-driven campaigns. "Reputation is everything," Kempner tells Observer, stressing the firm's ultimate mission to be "trusted stewards internally for a culture of innovation and accountability." Among 2024’s hires: Former R&C PMK exec Alisa Granz as MWW’s head of brand, and Sarah Moloney joined as UK managing director from KWT Global. Kempner himself remains a key figure in Democratic politics; The New York Times cited him in a July story on Biden donors. mww.com “Almost every client relationship now includes a crisis plan." — Founder & CEO Amy RF|Binder With a team of 75, founder and CEO Amy RF|Binder’s firm may be smaller in size than some corporate agencies but has serious sway, guiding major clients through our bumpy business landscape. In 2024, RF|Binder marked a standout year with the acquisition purpose/sustainability agency Taft Communications and fintech-focused Peaks Strategies. Between continued industry accolades and a third consecutive Crain’s Best Places to Work nod, the firm also made a commitment to sustainability through 1% for the Planet, donating one percent of revenue to address urgent environmental issues. “Business can, and should, be a force for good," RF|Binder explained. "Business leaders and brands have the power and the responsibility to take on initiatives that improve society at large." RF|Binder tells Observer that the firm's proprietary "ClarityLens" has driven measurable results since its 2023 release. The strategic comms framework ensures RF|Binder is "aligning a client’s business and communications strategies, showcases the firm’s commitment to maximizing impact and delivering data-driven insights," Binder says. Binder also coined the term “controlled media”―a sharper term for what other firms call owned platforms. Business wins in 2024 include US Money Reserve, Yum China, Advocate Health, Flack Global Metals, QXO and USSA International, the U.S. subsidiary of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. RF|Binder|Binder also keeps expanding relationships with key clients like Cargill, Fisher Investments, Welspun Living, Natixis Investment Managers, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Peachtree Group, Paris Baguette and Impax Asset Management. RF|Binder|Binder will mark its 25th anniversary in 2026. rfbinder.com “Working with a global restaurant company whose brand was widely seen as lagging, we got them to revitalize their product line and leapfrog their competitors with a truly dramatic, industry-leading ‘clean label’ commitment. This reinforced the importance of thinking big, having the courage of your convictions, and making sure your persuasion skills were on point.” – Founder & CEO Nick Kalm Reputation Partners founder Nick Kalm is such a high-profile figure in Chicago and D.C. that Politico wished him a happy birthday last year (it’s March 24), which he humbly and kindly downplays to Observer as, "not a big deal at all." Kalm's firm has developed a national reputation as one of the best, with more than 99 percent of all clients over the past 16 years recommending Reputation Partners for its expertise in corporate communications, issues management and client satisfaction. New clients for “special situations” and reputation management—confidential, of course—include a major automaker, a large consumer-goods company and one of the world’s largest retailers, Kalm tells Observer. New PR clients for the 22-year-old firm include event-management giant Encore, German manufacturing behemoth Guntner and California’s Lynx Logistics. The firm has counseled mall giant Simon Property Group, global restaurant group Darden, the Michigan Health System and Ingersoll-Rand. Internal and external comms around labor issues have long been a specialty. “At its core, our philosophy is a two-way 'no jerks' policy, for ourselves and for those we are supporting or interacting with," Executive Vice President and General Manager Andrew Moyer tells Observer. "You don’t need work to be a family, but you do need it to be a place people are excited to go to, and you need the team to be one people want to work with. Take care of the human connections, and the quality work will follow.” It should come as no surprise that, in 2024, Reputation Partners welcomed their sixth “boomerang” employee back to the company. reputationpartners.com "When the media reaches out, they know what guides us and that we will be honest, tenacious and reliable—just as we are for our clients." – Founder & CEO Risa Heller In 2024, Risa Heller Communications expanded westward, launching an LA office under the leadership of Netflix alum Erika Masonhall, a veteran of Facebook, NBC News and Sen. Joe Lieberman’s press operation. Other key hires include Julie Wood, former New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s Communications Director; Hazel Crampton-Hays, a press secretary to both Hochul and Andrew Cuomo; and Nate Evans, a former senior advisor to the U.S. UN Ambassador and Vice President Kamala Harris—bringing serious political muscle into the fold. Last year, RHC deepened its grip on tech, steering early-stage and pre-IPO companies across digital healthcare, fintech and Web3 through turbulence while continuing to represent industry giants facing regulatory heat like Airbnb, DoorDash and Match Group. Additionally, it continued to expand its client base across media, entertainment and sports. The firm also broadened its work with VCs, private equity leaders and investors on what it calls “sensitive and critical matters” for both the firms and their portfolio companies. The firm’s influence extends far beyond Silicon Valley, of course. RHC is the agency of record for New York’s most high-stakes real estate and civic issues, representing the likes of Howard Hughes, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Prologis and the Real Estate Board of New York. RHC’s PR expertise spans Vornado Realty Trust, Ken Griffin and Rudin's Park Avenue tower, the Met’s contemporary wing expansion and Silverstein Properties’ bid for a Manhattan casino—positioning the firm at the center of New York’s most transformative development and policy decisions. At the same time, the firm continued to represent prominent higher and lower education institutions as they navigated increased scrutiny related to the new federal landscape, contentious campus issues and high-profile stakeholders. And when it comes to labor disputes, RHC has established itself as the go-to operator, spearheading the U.S. Maritime Alliance’s response to a three-day union strike and managing other workplace issues with surgical precision. From Wall Street to Hollywood, from boardrooms to City Hall, RHC isn’t shaping conversations but deciding who gets to have them. risaheller.com Visual Arts PR is about myth-making. A well-placed profile can turn an emerging artist into a market darling overnight, while the right whisper campaign ensures a gallery’s latest wunderkind is suddenly “one to watch.” It’s the unseen hand shaping auction trends, museum acquisitions and which Instagram-friendly installations end up flooding your feed. From choreographing billion-dollar Basquiat sales to ensuring the right critics fawn over a mid-tier retrospective, PR in the art world is less about promotion and more about perception—because in this business, value isn’t just in the work but in the narrative. "When you work with clients for the long-term, success looks different year-on-year, and creativity comes from being nimble, responsive and by bringing people together to tell stories that matter." — President & Managing Director Jennifer Joy It’s been a busy year for this very plugged-in agency. New clients included Hong Kong Tourism Board, Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit, National Gallery of Athens, Sharjah Art Foundation, The Contemporary Austin, Skarstedt, Toledo Museum of Art, Wexner Center for the Arts and the Wellcome Trust—plus U.S. representation of Art Basel and the launch of Art Basel Paris in the Grand Palais. Two long-term museum clients celebrated milestone anniversaries, with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in D.C. celebrating 50 years and The Bass in Miami Beach turning sixty. Sutton also launched the Little Village arts hub in Detroit, the inaugural Atlanta Art Fair and Widening the Lens: Photography, Ecology and the Contemporary Landscape, a podcast from Carnegie Museum of Art hosted by tennis champion, entrepreneur and arts advocate Venus Williams. Founded in London by Calum Sutton and led in the U.S. by President and Managing Director Jennifer Joy, Sutton also operates from Paris, Singapore, Hong Kong and Miami. Over the past year, Sutton has promoted Allison Thorpe to Senior Vice President and also hired freelance writer and essayist Shaquille Heath as an Account Director. "Creativity is our compass," Thorpe tells Observer. "We’re all about big ideas and connecting through culture to inspire not just our clients but also our team. We know how to mix work with a good time; fun fuels us. But make no mistake: we’re pros at delivering. This defines our culture and keeps our relationships thriving." suttoncomms.com "I like to walk a mile in a client's shoes. We curate exhibitions. We publish books. We organize lectures, and sometimes we give them. We throw parties just because. You can’t relate to creatives if you don’t take creative risks yourself." — President Adam Abdalla Adam Abdalla's Cultural Counsel has always operated at the intersection of art, ideas and power, but in 2024, the firm’s influence extended beyond the art world to shaping entire cities. With engagements from the Mayor’s Office in Boston, the City of Miami Beach and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Cultural Counsel is now defining how municipalities position themselves as cultural capitals. At the institutional level, the firm delivered national press for the Art Dealers Association of America’s collaboration with Henry Street Settlement and spearheaded media strategy forThe Great Elephant Migration, an awe-inspiring conservation initiative sending 100 handcrafted elephant sculptures across the country, from Blackfeet Nation to Art Basel Miami Beach, securing high-profile coverage in The New York Times, CBS Sunday Morning, Vogue and NBC. For Theaster Gates’ blockbuster exhibition at CAMH, Cultural Counsel landed him a T Magazine cover, while its campaign for Counterpublic’s transfer of Sugarloaf Mound to the Osage Nation applied national pressure for the final parcel of land to be returned. The firm’s reach was equally evident during Art Basel Miami Beach, orchestrating a Pérez Art Museum Miami presentation featuring Kate Capshaw, director Franklin Sirmans and Miami barber Sergei Grant. Meanwhile, it led the media push for the American Academy of Arts and Letters’ public launch and the Columbus Museum of Art’s first solo show for painter Robin F. Williams. Harmony Korine’s EDGLRD tapped Cultural Counsel for its launch and the rollout of AGGRO DR1FT, a neon-drenched cinematic experiment that has become an underground phenomenon and the firm managed the publicity blitz for Making Their Mark, the Komal Shah and Shah Garg Foundation’s ambitious exhibition highlighting 84 women artists, curated by Cecilia Alemani. "The quality of your work is characterized by your broader frame of reference," Abdalla tells Observer. Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Cultural Counsel has cemented itself as the firm that bridges artists, institutions and the broader cultural discourse. culturalcounsel.com "Don’t be gimmicky. Tell your client’s story before it gets distorted by other engines of information. 'No comment' is not a strategy; it allows clickbait warriors to fill the void." — Founder John Melick Blue Medium has long been a powerhouse in art, design and architecture, but 2024 marked a defining year with the addition of major new clients—including superstar artist KAWS and Australia’s leading First Nations art gallery, D’Lan Contemporary, with locations in Melbourne, Sydney and New York. Founder John Melick’s agency continues to shape the cultural landscape, representing the Andy Warhol Museum, the Outsider Art Fair, Mystic Seaport Museum, Andrew Edlin Gallery, Greensboro’s Weatherspoon Art Museum and the Shelley & Donald Rubin Foundation, alongside an expanding roster of institutions such as MCA Australia, the Kallir Research Institute and the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, which champions Puerto Rican and Latinx artists. The firm’s design and architecture practice remains just as formidable, with clients like Beyer Blinder Belle, the Rhode Island School of Design, the Miami Center for Architecture and Design and Friedman Benda, one of NYC’s premier design galleries. Blue Medium helped the American Australian Association launch the Beverley Art Writers Travel Grant—which supports American art writers looking to explore Australia’s art scene—further cementing its role as a bridge between cultural spheres. Looking ahead, the firm is sharpening its focus on international expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, where Melick hails from. With its partner agency, Bower Blue, Blue Medium is also doubling down on digital content, ensuring its clients’ narratives aren’t just well-placed but well-told across platforms. Melick's guiding philosophy? "Become deeply familiar with the editorial direction of an outlet, and then get to know, personally, the individuals who dedicate their careers to covering our spectacular communities." bluemedium.com “We needed to make sure that over 30 visiting journalists could experience artwork at a new biennial spread across 15 sites in the greater Toronto area in one day. So, we hired a bus and provided boxed lunches on board with the curators, who shared details about the various projects and were available for questions at and between sites. It’s an indication of the respect we have for journalists’ time, what they each want to focus on, and how we can best deliver useful information to them to craft their stories." — Principal Heather Meltzer Based in New York and Toronto, Heather Meltzer and Libby Mark's tiny boutique firm punches above its weight with clients including Toronto’s Contact Photography Festival, Nashville’s Frist Museum, the Friends of Florence Foundation, UCI Jack and Shanaz Langson Institute and Museum of California Art, Asian Cultural Council, Toronto’s Gardiner Museum, Toronto Biennial of Art and the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens, a world-class botanical research and conservation institution in Sarasota, Florida—where long-awaited exhibition George Harrison: A Gardener’s Life opens this spring. The first net-positive energy botanical garden in the world, Selby Gardens blends sustainability and architectural innovation and expands public access to its renowned collection of epiphytes. Also on the horizon is the opening of The Wanlass Center for Art Education & Research at the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art at USU and the exhibition Venice and the Ottoman Empire opening at the Frist Art Museum in May. As to how the team balances creativity with a pressure to deliver results? "That really depends on the client and their appetite for exploring new ideas and different ways of doing things," Mark tells Observer. "Sometimes it’s a matter of offering options." "Having worked together for over 12 years as a team with either Libby or me taking the lead with each project, we know that this model gives our clients the support needed to promote their institutions and newsworthy moments,” Meltzer adds. bow-bridge.com “The arts and culture sector is facing pressure from every direction during this particularly volatile moment. Over the past few years, we’ve seen an increasing need for support in crisis communications, issues management, change communications, and internal communications. We anticipate that this critical, behind-the-scenes work will continue to be a major focus in 2025, in tandem with our work to advance audience engagement and impact.” Founder & President David Resnicow It took four years for Michelangelo to complete the Sistine Chapel, but only one year—2024—for this dynamic firm to win a dazzling display of new business, including returning client the Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Academy in Rome, Gladstone Gallery, National Gallery of Art, Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, John Michael Kohler Arts Center and SCOPE Art Show. They join a powerhouse list of current clients, including the Rubell Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Frick Collection, Park Avenue Armory and the San Francisco Ballet. For the U.S. Pavilion at the 2024 Venice Biennale, the firm led an 18-month media blitz around the space in which to place me, Jeffrey Gibson’s groundbreaking solo exhibition—the first by an Indigenous artist to represent the U.S. in Venice. With 11 international cover stories and over 760 pieces of coverage, R+A catalyzed a global conversation on Indigenous art’s place in contemporary culture. This marks the ninth time in 14 years that R+A has represented the U.S. Pavilion, a streak that speaks for itself. Back home, R+A played a critical role in shaping the public narrative around The Apollo’s 90th anniversary season, securing major coverage for a milestone-packed year—The Apollo’s first-ever expansion, the 90th anniversary of Amateur Night, Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ Walk of Fame induction and its history-making Kennedy Center Honor. The result? National and international attention, including CBS Sunday Morning, CBS Mornings and a four-page Washington Post feature. Capping off five consecutive years of record-breaking growth, R+A hit its highest revenue in 2024 and expanded to a team of 39. With a focus on its digital practice and team, R+A hired digital coordinator Lila Tulp. Director Claire Hurley returned to R+A after four years at Pace Gallery, where she worked closely with leading contemporary artists as well as major foundations and estates on campaigns. In the world of cultural communications, R+A remains the firm to beat. resnicow.com We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: 5 New Presales Set to Explode in February as Michael Saylor Breaks Forbes in Two
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/5-new-presales-set-to-explode-in-february-as-michael-saylor-breaks-forbes-in-two/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T16:55:37Z
Full Content:
MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has made it to the cover of Forbes, with the magazine giving him the title “The Bitcoin Alchemist.” The title’s fitting, to say the least. After all, this is a man who was quick to identify Bitcoin’s potential, as he started accumulating it ever since he stepped foot in the market five years ago. His company, MicroStrategy, went all in on BTC after the pandemic. Then came the SEC’s approval of Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Donald Trump’s seemingly pro-crypto presidential campaign. Long story short, BTC skyrocketed, and so did MicroStrategy’s and Michael Saylor’s fortunes. The company’s stock jumped over 700% last year, and Saylor’s net worth rose $1.9B in 2024 to a whopping $9.4B in January 2025. This is just one of the many crazy stories inspired by BTC’s meteoric rise in the last few years. However, none of this is to say that a tale like this can’t be replicated. In fact, with Bitcoin close to a new all-time high and with Donald Trump making one crypto-friendly announcement after another, the crypto economy is ripe for a serious rally. You can capitalize on the upcoming bull run by investing in early-stage, high-potential cryptos, such as the 5 new presales we’ve handpicked for you in this guide. Knowledge is power, and Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) aims to provide retail crypto traders insider information so that they can crush the crypto whales, who manipulate the market and give little to no chance for the average Joe to make a profit. $WEPE’s presale performance has been nothing short of breathtaking. At the time of writing, it has crossed the $65M mark and now looks set to sail past $70M, which would make it the biggest presale ever, ahead of Pepe Unchained’s $70M raise before listing. Another noteworthy point is that $PEPU jumped 37% in the past 24 hours, meaning it’s safe to say that a very large presale number has helped it remain viable longer-term. This could also apply to $WEPE, which is currently available for $0.0003665. If this will be your first meme coin presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy $WEPE for more information about the buying process. If you’re after the best crypto presales on the market right now, Solaxy ($SOLX) should undoubtedly be one of the first you consider. It has been built with a special purpose, i.e., to get rid of Solana’s limitations and help it become a cryptocurrency giant. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the Solana network, Solaxy will combine the strengths of Ethereum (vast liquidity) and Solana (lower fees) to solve issues of limited scalability, failed transactions, and network congestion in a class-leading manner. Speaking of $SOLX’s presale, it has been well received by crypto enthusiasts. With close to $17M in presale funding, interested investors can join the bandwagon by getting Solaxy for $0.00162 each – here’s how to buy $SOLX. However, you should hurry up, as prices increase in the next 16 hours. In a crypto economy that’s, honestly speaking, quite fraught with risk, Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers a beacon of hope for conservative investors who don’t want to miss out on the potential of crypto but don’t want to take on excessive risks either. $MEMEX is a basket of the best meme coins, means it allows you to diversify your risk, Additionally, it offers four meme index baskets, each with a different degree of risk, reward, and volatility. For instance, the Meme Frenzy Index offers the highest potential for ginormous gains, but it’s equally risky. The Meme Titan Index, on the other hand, is a much ‘safer’ basket, seeing as it contains the top 10 coins of the industry. The $MEMEX presale is currently underway, having already raised over $3M so far. You can get 1 $MEMEX for $0.0157183 if you get in now. Additionally, early adopters will also benefit from $MEMEX’s 714% staking rewards. Here’s how to buy $MEMEX. What if we told you that you could turn back time and invest in $TRUMP right before it blew up and generated over 300% returns in less than two weeks from launch? Although we don’t have a time machine, we can’t point you towards YourTrump ($YTP), which, in principle, is exactly like Official Trump. YourTrump, too, is based on Donald Trump’s popularity. To be more precise, the token’s price depends on the number of followers Trump has on the social media platform X. His follower count currently sits at a whopping 99.8M. 1 $YTP is currently available for $0.0572, and if the estimated listing price of the token on YourTrump’s official website is anything to go by (it’s currently $7.2767), $YTP’s presale investors can make some mind-boggling returns. Rexas Finance is a one-of-a-kind crypto project that wants to offer token holders the ability to tokenize real, tangible assets, such as art, gold, real estate, and commodities, as well as intellectual property. $RXS’s presale numbers are only behind Wall Street Pepe. It has sold over 443M tokens and raised more than $44M as of now. Additionally, Rexas Finance has caught the favor of whales, as there have been sizable purchases of $179K and $158K on January 15 and January 22, respectively. This could be great news for early adopters of the project, who can get it now for just $0.2 per token. Having rounded up the top new crypto presales to invest in right now, it’s important we mention the importance of only investing an amount you’re comfortable losing. This is because even though the meme coin market is destined for long-term growth, it’s not without its ups and downs. Also, none of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.

Title: QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM): Generative AI Meets Automotive Innovation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Coatue’s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against Coatue’s other most important AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI’s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail. Investment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI’s outsized appeal to investors. Companies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new “super cycle” in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles. Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry’s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace—MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade—AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms. The growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI’s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Some investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI’s long-term potential. AI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today’s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership. Some investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue’s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive. As inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI’s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue’s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

January 31, 2025 08:45 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "China Mutual Funds Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2020-2030F" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The China Mutual Funds Market was valued at USD 8.47 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 2.77 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.80% The China mutual funds market has experienced significant growth, driven by a surge in household investments, increasing disposable incomes, and the growing adoption of diversified investment portfolios. With the equity fund segment dominating the market due to its higher returns and popularity among retail investors, other segments like bond funds and money market funds are gaining traction due to their stability and lower risk.Institutional investors, such as insurers and pension funds, play a pivotal role in driving growth through large-scale investments, while distribution channels like direct sales from mutual fund companies and professional financial advisors facilitate seamless access for investors. The market's growth is further fuelled by favourable regulatory reforms, increasing financial literacy, and digital innovation in fund distribution. As competition intensifies, fund managers are introducing innovative products tailored to various investor needs, ensuring robust growth prospects for the market up to 2030. Sustainable InvestingThe growing global focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors has significantly influenced China's mutual funds market. Investors are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, making ESG-focused funds a critical trend. Asset management companies are integrating ESG criteria into their fund strategies, responding to demand for socially responsible investment options. These funds not only cater to the environmental and ethical concerns of investors but also offer long-term financial benefits by targeting industries and businesses with sustainable growth prospects. Regulatory bodies in China are actively encouraging ESG investing by introducing guidelines and reporting standards.For instance, funds now frequently disclose their sustainability goals and their alignment with international frameworks, such as the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment. This transparency fosters trust among investors. Additionally, ESG funds appeal to younger investors, who are more inclined to align their financial decisions with their values. The success of ESG-focused funds demonstrates a shift in investor priorities and highlights the role of sustainable practices in shaping the future of mutual fund portfolios.Personalized ServicesAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics are revolutionizing personalized investment solutions in China's mutual funds market. Fund managers and financial institutions are leveraging these technologies to provide tailored recommendations that align with individual investor goals, risk tolerance, and time horizons. For example, robo-advisors analyze vast amounts of data, including market trends and investor profiles, to create customized portfolios that optimize performance while minimizing risks.Personalized services have also increased investor engagement by making the investment process more intuitive. Mobile applications and online platforms offer features like goal-based planning, dynamic portfolio adjustments, and real-time performance tracking. Such innovations not only enhance customer satisfaction but also encourage long-term participation in mutual funds. The ability to deliver highly individualized solutions is rapidly becoming a competitive differentiator for asset management companies in China.Money Market Funds ExpansionMoney market funds have emerged as a cornerstone of China's mutual funds market, driven by their stability, liquidity, and suitability for short-term financial goals. These funds are particularly appealing to first-time investors and those seeking low-risk options, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. The simplicity of money market funds, coupled with their ability to deliver predictable returns, has made them an attractive alternative to traditional savings accounts.In recent years, innovations in digital distribution channels have further fueled the growth of money market funds. Platforms such as Alipay and WeChat have integrated these funds into their ecosystems, making them easily accessible to millions of users. This convenience has contributed to the rapid adoption of money market funds among retail investors. As China's economy continues to stabilize, money market funds are expected to maintain their prominence, serving as a gateway for investors transitioning to more complex mutual fund products.Segmental InsightsBased on Fund Type, Equity funds are the leading segment in China's mutual funds market, driven by strong performance and their appeal to investors seeking capital appreciation. These funds primarily invest in stocks, offering higher growth potential compared to other fund types. As China's economy expands and its stock market matures, equity funds have emerged as an attractive avenue for wealth creation. The segment's growth is fueled by the increasing participation of retail and institutional investors, drawn by the robust returns often associated with equity markets. Furthermore, regulatory reforms aimed at promoting transparency and corporate governance have boosted investor confidence in equity investments.Sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy are popular choices within equity funds, aligning with China's economic priorities and offering strong growth prospects. Equity funds also benefit from digital platforms and fintech innovations, which have simplified access and attracted younger, tech-savvy investors. Personalized tools, such as robo-advisors, make it easier for individuals to invest in equity funds tailored to their goals and risk tolerance. While equity funds carry higher risk due to market volatility, their potential for long-term returns makes them a cornerstone for portfolio diversification, ensuring their continued dominance in China's mutual funds market.Regional InsightsThe East region was the leading area in China's mutual funds market due to its robust financial infrastructure and economic development. Major financial hubs like Shanghai and Shenzhen are in this region, making it a key driver of investment activity. These cities are home to a significant number of financial institutions, asset managers, and brokers, which contribute to higher mutual fund adoption. The East region also benefits from a high level of urbanization, with large and affluent populations, which translates into a greater investor base for mutual funds. Moreover, investors in the East tend to be more financially literate, having greater access to information and advisory services, further driving the growth of the mutual funds market. Additionally, Eastern China enjoys a strong middle class with disposable income that increasingly seeks diverse investment options, making mutual funds a popular choice.

Title: Foremost Meme Index Presale to Skyrocket as SEC Approves New ETFs

Time Published: 2025-01-31T10:30:32Z

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked Bitwise’s application for the third Bitcoin-Ethereum exchange-traded fund ($BTC-$ETH ETF) in the US. The regulator hasn’t yet approved the ETF but might do so soon, which would allow Bitwise clients to gain indirect exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies at once. While institutional investors are dipping their toes in crypto through ETFs, the degen community is discovering traditional investment vehicles like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) could pioneer this new trend. Bitwise cleared the first resistance on the path to its ETF approval – the 19b-4 form. Now, the issuer awaits the approval of the S-1 form for the fund to hit the market. Earlier this week, Tuttle Capital also filed for ten altcoin ETFs, including meme coins $TRUMP, $MELANIA, and $BONK. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart points out that ETF issuers are probing the SEC’s boundaries. The SEC has already greenlit Canary Capital’s $LTC ETF, so the question is – where will regulators draw the line? The rapid growth of the $BTC ETF sector is a good case in point. The first spot $BTC ETFs by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale were approved in January 2024. A year later, there are 12 US $BTC ETFs with total cumulative inflows of $40.18B. Yesterday’s $BTC ETF inflows alone amounted to $588M, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leading the charge ($321M). US $ETH spot ETFs also recorded $67.77M inflows yesterday, bringing the total inflows to $2.73B. Partly due to the accelerated institutional adoption driven by ETFs, $BTC rose 143% year-to-date and now trades at $$104K. If the SEC were to approve altcoin ETFs, the entire crypto market would surge due to added legitimacy and accessibility. While the Wall Street guys explore crypto through ETFs, degen traders tap into stock market products like indexes. Meme Index ($MEMEX) resolves the two main hurdles of meme coin investors – finding promising coins and managing risk. It introduces four meme coin indexes that cater to different risk appetites: Titan (the least volatile), Moonshot and MidCap (mid volatility), and Frenzy (high-risk, high-rewards assets). The meme coin market cap amassed $100B. New tokens enter the arena every day, and the leaderboard can change in the bat of an eye. That’s why putting all your hard-earned money into one project isn’t the best strategy. By investing in eight tokens instead of one, you spread risk and offset potential losses, thus enjoying higher average returns. Early adopters have already invested $3.1M in the $MEMEX presale and staked 139M tokens at a 718% dynamic APY. Beyond providing access to Meme Index baskets, the $MEMEX token gives its holders governance rights to steer the project’s direction. The lines between old-school finance and crypto are blurring. The SEC’s warming up to crypto ETFs – it has already said yes to $BTC and $ETH, so altcoins and even meme coins could be next. This means Wall Street is finally taking crypto seriously. And with projects like Meme Index, we see degens embracing the tried and tested investment strategies. All of this means one thing – there’s no way of stopping the crypto train. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any project. Even the broader bull run and strong project fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's 15 Best European AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Iberdrola, S.A. (OTC:IBDRY) stands against Morgan Stanley's other European AI stocks. In August last year, investment bank Morgan Stanley released an investor note highlighting that even though the chaos around prominent AI firms had somewhat subsided, an AI rumbling in Europe was just about to begin. Analysts at the investment firm compared the AI buzz to historical similarities in the mid-1990s, just before the internet craze. According to Morgan Stanley analysts, European semi stocks were experiencing a tactical correction and would hit new highs in the coming months. The note further detailed that a basket of these equities, handpicked by these experts, and nicknamed AI winners, had returned close to 45% on average since January 2023, the beginning of the AI revolution. These firms had outperformed the 14% jump recorded by the MSCI Europe benchmark, per the research. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In the months since, European AI stocks have experienced significant volatility, most recently influenced by global developments and investor sentiment. A notable event was the introduction of a low-cost AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which raised concerns about the profitability of existing AI companies that rely on expensive chips and infrastructure. This led to a sharp decline in European tech stocks, with the European tech index dropping 5.8%, marking the worst decline since October 2024. However, the market showed resilience shortly after. European shares reached a record high, driven by gains in retail and utilities stocks as tensions in the tech sector subsided. European stock pickers are exploring established sectors such as utilities, professional data providers, and even copper miners to tap into the next wave of AI advancements. This approach reflects a strategic shift towards industries that can support and benefit from AI infrastructure and applications.

(OTC:IBDRY) is a Spanish firm that engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, and supply of electricity in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France, and Australia. Iberdrola's financial performance demonstrates significant growth, with a reported net profit of €5.5 billion and an EBITDA of €13.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024. This success is partly attributed to the company's strategic investments in AI to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement. Collaborating with AWS, Iberdrola is developing generative AI applications to optimize energy production. AI data centers have created a need for power that is likely to drive utility firms towards the upgradation of their existing capacities to accommodate rising demand. Overall IBDRY ranks 11th on our list of Morgan Stanley's European AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of IBDRY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trump’s crypto order could ‘break Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle’ – Bitwise predicts trillions in new capital
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/trumps-crypto-order-could-break-bitcoins-4-year-cycle-bitwise-predicts-trillions-in-new-capital/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T08:00:43Z
Full Content:
Is Bitcoin’s infamous four-year cycle coming to an end? Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes that President Donald Trump’s latest crypto executive order could upend the long-standing four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined the crypto market for over a decade. According to him, this regulatory shift can challenge the widely accepted market pattern, potentially altering how investors approach digital assets. With growing speculation about Trump’s influence on the crypto industry, this move could mark the beginning of a new market dynamic. It might diverge from historical trends and reshape expectations for the future of cryptocurrencies. Remarking on the same, Hougan wrote in a note to clients on 29 January. The note said, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto,” “We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” Historically, Bitcoin [BTC] has followed a predictable four-year cycle, with three years of strong gains followed by a significant correction ranging from 58% to 74%. According to Hougan, this pattern has held true, with 2023 and 2024 delivering impressive returns, setting expectations for another strong year in 2025. However, he believes that investors are beginning to question whether 2026 could bring a market reset. While many attribute the cycle to Bitcoin’s halving events, Hougan claimed that broader market psychology and speculative behavior play a more significant role, shaped by key industry events such as exchange launches, major collapses, and regulatory crackdowns. He added, “If we were following the classic four-year cycle, 2025 would be a great year for crypto. And I think it will be: We’re on the record predicting that bitcoin’s price will double this year to above $200,000, driven by flows into ETFs and bitcoin purchases by corporations and governments. That may turn out to be conservative.” According to Hougan, the current mainstream crypto cycle emerged from the market turmoil of 2022, marked by the collapse of firms like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius. The turning point came on 10 March 2023, when Grayscale secured an initial victory in its legal battle against the SEC, paving the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their launch in January 2024 attracted institutional investors, driving Bitcoin’s price from approximately $22,000 to over $100,000 within a year – Signifying crypto’s shift into the mainstream. Worth pointing out, however, that Hougan sees the timing as the biggest challenge ahead. While regulatory shifts and political developments in Washington favor long-term crypto growth, their full impact may take years to materialize. In fact, if these effects are only felt by 2026, Hougan questioned whether another “crypto winter” in 2025 would align with past market cycles. He said, “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While the crypto market is evolving, Bitwise’s CIO believes the traditional four-year cycle is not entirely behind us. As the bull market progresses, increasing leverage could still lead to corrections. However, with the industry’s growing maturity, he expects these downturns to be less severe and shorter in duration, compared to previous cycles. While volatility remains a factor, the resilience of the crypto space may help cushion future pullbacks, marking a shift in how market cycles play out. In conclusion, he put it best when he said, “As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Paul Costelloe: ‘I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain'

He will be 80 in June but veteran Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe shows no sign of slowing down. He continues to show at London Fashion Week, which he has done for the past 40 years as well as designing homewares, womenswear and menswear lines for Dunnes Stores. Last September, he launched his first bridal collection called Primavera, 15 dresses inspired by his couture collection. He also has a rake of profitable licenses including a jewellery and accessories collection for the American QVC shopping channel. We meet at his Monkstown home, bought in 1984, a beautiful Regency building which, after he moved to London in 1999, was rented to a French family. Adjoining it is a converted coach house where his mother-in-law resided until recently. On this brief visit to Dublin, he is staying there with his wife Anne and their son William, design director of the company, a gifted artist who trained at the Chelsea School of Art. Dressed casually in a blue hoodie and jeans, Costelloe reflects on his early career over coffee in the kitchen, recalling his first fashion presentation in London in the early 1980s, with Northern Irish financial support, at the Hyde Park Hotel, along with John Rocha. “I was worried about making money because I had children. A journalist told me I needed to be more adventurous, and I remember feeling I was not as adventurous as I should have been. Now I am too adventurous,” he grins. Having trained in the Grafton Academy and worked in Paris with fashion designer Jacques Esterel, followed by two years in Milan with Rinascente and four in New York, he was invited to show at the inaugural British Designer Show (precursor of London Fashion Week) in Olympia in 1984. He told Vogue that he had wanted to be the Irish Ralph Lauren. Recalling that period, he mentions Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher that year. “Fashion made statements then,” he says admiringly. “Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” Youngest of a family of seven himself, he attributes the trait of pride to his late father, from whom he also inherited a love of textiles. “He was an industrious, courageous manufacturer in Dublin, a self-made man from Limerick with a glamorous American trophy wife from New York. Having American culture and Irish culture in those days was very extreme, but it produced plenty of interesting people though maybe not the happiest,” he concedes. Cosmetics and perfume is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside. The high points of his long career, he says, are easy to remember and he does not include, somewhat surprisingly, being the personal designer for Princess Diana, with whom he has always been associated. He lists them as follows: “winning the Caltex Art Competition for under 16s when I became something of a hero in Blackrock College for maybe a day or two. Designing the British Airways uniforms and travelling by Concorde to Hong Kong, Brazil and Argentina. The collaboration with Wedgwood on ceramics and porcelain in the north of England. Getting married two days before Christmas and having the car washed before we went into the church”. The Wedgwood tableware sold well in the US but not in Japan, so it was a disappointment. “I think big and I design big, but I didn’t consider the Japanese market so it slumped there,” he says. He also has memories of working in New York for four years designing lingerie for Larry Sunshine (“no sunshine and very ruthless”) on the 85th floor of the Empire State Building and designing a wedding dress for Tricia Nixon (Richard Nixon’s daughter) in 1971. Back in Ireland, he launched his first collection in 1978, remembered for its spectacular and tailored use of Irish linen from Strelitz and Moygashel in Northern Ireland and building the business to the point where he had concessions throughout the UK and free-standing stores. It was in one of these, in Windsor, where a lady in waiting for Princess Di first saw his work in 1983, opening the door to Kensington Palace. “Linen is my birthright for some reason,” he says of his regular use of the fabric. His first runway show in London a year later called Witness, based on the Harrison Ford Amish movie, featured those romantic linen dresses. A collaboration this year will bring that focus on linen full circle, but he is reluctant to divulge details. “As a designer I always looked for collaborations which are now quite common, but in those early days designers had to survive on their own merits. I prefer to use other people’s money to exploit my creativity. I always see financial advantage over good taste and that is how I have managed to give my children a decent education. It is about compromise and for a designer that’s not the best,” he says with a shrug. Which brings us to his long association with Dunnes and he is predictably enthusiastic, describing it as “an amazing company”. He explains how it started 15 years ago after Debenhams had launched a “Designers at Debenhams” brand introducing Jasper Conran and John Rocha. “I hadn’t been approached, so I contacted Margaret Heffernan and we met up and agreed to collaborate on homewares, which is still the foundation of the Paul Costelloe brand. I deal with Margaret directly – we have regular conversations and meet for coffee in the Herbert Park Hotel. I have a lot of respect for her and her daughter Ann (Heffernan), a doctor who looks after food and niece Sharon [McMahon], who is head of textiles.” He deals with and travels with Dunnes’ buyers. “My son William is just back from China and Hong Kong, where the [Dunnes] buyers wrangled the best products at the best prices. We go to India in the spring. We started womenswear in 2011 on the success of the homewares – menswear was slow to start because, typical males, they don’t move. Men are consistent – boringly so at times – but once you win them over, they really get enthusiastic, and I find that a lot more fun than women who say ‘why are you not making in my size?’” [ Our fashion designers make waves globally, so why don’t we value their cultural contribution here?Opens in new window ] Men’s wear, now in its 10th year, is stocked in 50 stores across the country and he gets accurate sales figures on a monthly basis on each collection. Though Dunnes does not publish accounts, Costelloe’s design management company has been posting profits since 2016, a year after his association with Ireland’s retail giant, though the latest accounts, to the end of August 2023, show a loss of €152,055 in 2023, down from a profit in 2022 of €511,410, a bumper year for the company. The loss trimmed accumulated profits at Paul Costelloe Design Management Ltd from €2.2 million to just over €2 million, according to a report in The Irish Times in June. He pays tribute to his financial director Gerry Mescal (a distant relative of the actor Paul), whom he dubs “Mr Cautious” and who has “looked after us for 40 years”. Costelloe’s advice to aspiring young fashion designers is always to have a good accountant. The catwalk shows have changed in their purpose since he first showed at London Fashion Week. “Before, the catwalk was the commercial vendor of the brand, so it was important that people buy into it. Now, it is a couture collection of one-off pieces which keeps up consumer brand awareness outside the UK and Ireland because [the show] gets covered all over the world, so it’s like an art gallery and not a collection. “People will say we saw your show on the TV in Hong Kong. It keeps it international, so it is worthwhile as we sell a lot online – handbags and other accessories, and that is growing.” Runway shows are expensive to stage – the last two in London cost €500,000. “That’s compared to the Italian shows, which cost a couple of a million each. But they have cosmetics and perfume and that is where the money is. I have tried that, but without success, so it keeps me humble. You are always prepared for the downside.” Free from the imperative commercial constraints of his first shows and for the high-street market, his London fashion collections are more spirited, flamboyant and colourful with that mix of tailoring and what the French call flou very much his signature. Left-handed, he continues to draw and paint and is physically active, with a 50-minute cycle to work every day from his home in Putney to his studio in central London. He plays tennis at weekends when he can. His sons are very supportive, and he works closely with William and loves going with him to Milan to select fabrics at the Milano Unica trade show. They are currently collaborating on a revamped revival of his brand Dressage launched in Brown Thomas in 1988. He retains clothing rights to the name. “Creativity and integrity will always win out and you take on board your past in your designs and we have done a lot over the years, but you don’t look back, we don’t indulge in the past. I look at everything, what people are wearing, what plates, shapes of mugs – you can do so much more with a creative brain,” he says. Painting is easier, he says. “You can sit on a wall and paint the landscape, but to design you must have discipline and know who is going to make your toile [test garment]. Sometimes my lovely drawings get lost in translation. We are hands on, it’s like farming, we work and feel with our hands.” On February 20th, he will once again open London Fashion Week at 9am, which he has been doing for the past 15 years, most recently in the ballroom of the Waldorf Hilton. But “it’s a poisoned chalice” he says with a wry grin.

Title: Will Chainlink (LINK) Overtake Cardano’s (ADA) Market Cap? Unlikely, But This Crypto Might
URL: https://punchng.com/will-chainlink-link-overtake-cardanos-ada-market-cap-unlikely-but-this-crypto-might/

The ongoing market downturn has sparked discussion about which cryptocurrency will hold its group once the bull cycle returns. Crypto investors are wondering if Chainlink (LINK) can surpass Cardano’s (ADA) market value, especially as LINK struggles to rebound from a price drop. While Chainlink may not reach Cardano’s market cap anytime soon, Rexas Finance (RXS), a trending presale token, is set to achieve that soon. Chainlink’s Battle to Overtake Cardano by Market Cap Chainlink’s price drops, and FUD worries the crypto community about its future. At $19.88, LINK’s has dipped 39% in the past month. Its market cap hovers around $12.5 billion, compared to Cardano’s $35 billion. Despite recent encouraging developments like the Chainlink-Blackrock cooperation, LINK is unlikely to reach Cardano’s market worth. Chainlink’s price history, market dynamics, and growth are issues. Analysts estimate favorable market sentiment might push LINK’s price toward $43 or $50 per token in 2025. Chainlink’s rise may boost short-term growth, but it will struggle to match Cardano’s market position, which is backed by steady growth and community support. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Crypto Contender Set to Flip Cardano While Chainlink fights market sentiment, Rexas Finance simplifies tokenizing real-world assets. This move breaks down barriers that have kept investors out of valuable marketplaces like real estate, art, and commodities markets. This move makes Rexas Finance a leader in an industry expected to reach $50 billion by 2025 and $16 trillion by 2030. Tokenizing real-world assets is Rexas Finance’s novel solution to liquidity, fractional ownership, and global investment. Its blockchain approach offers better liquidity and investment options than traditional methods. The ecosystem relies on the utility and governance of Rexas Token (RXS), which the platform uses for liquidity and rewards. One of Rexas Finance’s biggest advantages is its user-friendly platform for tokenizing real-world assets. The Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot let non-coders generate and manage tokens for real-world assets. This accessibility allows startups and major organizations to tokenize assets, democratizing investing and enhancing liquidity. Rexas Finance is also adding innovative features, such as Rexas GenAI, an AI-driven platform that simplifies NFT and digital asset generation, and Rexas AI Shield, which secures blockchain transactions. These new features help the project become a crypto market leader. The project’s focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) also helps it flourish. Rexas Finance is well-positioned to encourage DeFi adoption. Rexas Treasury delivers optimum yield farming options across several blockchains and the Rexas DeFi ecosystem, providing a secure and transparent platform for earning yields on digital assets. To attract both experienced investors and newbies to crypto, Rexas Finance is establishing a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges traditional asset management with the decentralized world. Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of remarkable, with each stage selling out ahead of schedule. Stage 11, which is now 97% complete, has increased the price by almost 6x, with RXS now priced at $0.175 per token. As the presale nears completion, Rexas Finance’s momentum is likely to grow, gaining attention from large investors. Upon the completion of the presale, RXS will debut on at least three of the top 10 global crypto exchanges, a move that will significantly enhance liquidity, push up the price, and extend the project’s market share. This forthcoming exchange debut is a crucial turning point for Rexas Finance. It will promote the token to a larger audience, thus strengthening its market presence. Rexas Finance will capitalize on its early success and grow swiftly in the next few months. Analysts forecast continuous growth and a parabolic price jump after its exchange listings. Conclusion Due to price volatility and market sentiment, Chainlink may struggle to overtake Cardano’s market cap, but Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking the next major crypto. A rising presale, a new approach to real-world asset tokenization, and a future listing on key exchanges position Rexas Finance for market growth. After acquiring a share of the $16 trillion RWA market and launching an exchange, Rexas Finance will be a powerful crypto competitor. With its focus on innovation, security, and liquidity, Rexas Finance may soon overtake Cardano’s market cap, making it an excellent investment for forward-thinking crypto enthusiasts.

This accessibility allows startups and major organizations to tokenize assets, democratizing investing and enhancing liquidity. Rexas Finance is also adding innovative features, such as Rexas GenAI, an AI-driven platform that simplifies NFT and digital asset generation, and Rexas AI Shield, which secures blockchain transactions. These new features help the project become a crypto market leader. The project’s focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) also helps it flourish. Rexas Finance is well-positioned to encourage DeFi adoption. Rexas Treasury delivers optimum yield farming options across several blockchains and the Rexas DeFi ecosystem, providing a secure and transparent platform for earning yields on digital assets. To attract both experienced investors and newbies to crypto, Rexas Finance is establishing a comprehensive ecosystem that bridges traditional asset management with the decentralized world. Rexas Finance’s presale has been nothing short of remarkable, with each stage selling out ahead of schedule. Stage 11, which is now 97% complete, has increased the price by almost 6x, with RXS now priced at $0.175 per token. As the presale nears completion, Rexas Finance’s momentum is likely to grow, gaining attention from large investors. Upon the completion of the presale, RXS will debut on at least three of the top 10 global crypto exchanges, a move that will significantly enhance liquidity, push up the price, and extend the project’s market share. This forthcoming exchange debut is a crucial turning point for Rexas Finance. It will promote the token to a larger audience, thus strengthening its market presence. Rexas Finance will capitalize on its early success and grow swiftly in the next few months. Analysts forecast continuous growth and a parabolic price jump after its exchange listings. Conclusion Due to price volatility and market sentiment, Chainlink may struggle to overtake Cardano’s market cap, but Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a compelling alternative for investors seeking the next major crypto. A rising presale, a new approach to real-world asset tokenization, and a future listing on key exchanges position Rexas Finance for market growth. After acquiring a share of the $16 trillion RWA market and launching an exchange, Rexas Finance will be a powerful crypto competitor.

If approved, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC will serve as the custodian. At the same time, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing will act as the fund's transfer agent, according to a 19b-4 filing submitted Thursday. Grayscale’s XRP Trust is one of several investment vehicles the firm has converted or is in the process of converting amid surging demand for digital asset-based investment offerings. The move follows the firm's successful conversion of its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF on January 11, 2024, and its Ethereum Trust into a spot ETF six months later. Grayscale has also sought SEC approval to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund—holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP—into a diversified multi-crypto ETF. In January 2025, the firm rebalanced the fund, increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s share to 90% while replacing Avalanche with Cardano. Issuers are rushing to gain approval for new crypto-based ETFs after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term in November. Along the campaign trail, Trump promised to shore up US regulations while making the country the crypto capital of the world. Grayscale’s XRP Trust holds roughly $16.1 million in assets under management. Its shares are held by American investor accounts seeking exposure to XRP “without the cost and complexity of purchasing the asset directly,” according to the filing. Investment trusts are closed-end funds that have a fixed number of shares, while ETFs are open-end funds that generate shares based on investor demand. As such, ETFs are typically more suitable investment vehicles to meet demand for an asset such as XRP, though that depends on investor preferences and market conditions. In any case, investor demand for XRP has proved particularly strong in recent weeks, with the token nearly breaking its all-time high of $3.40 earlier this month. XRP is trading at $3.13, up more than 525% in the past year. Investor interest in digital assets has soared in recent months, fueled by the launch of the widely popular spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. from major financial institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Asset managers such as Rex Shares, Canary Capital, and 21 Shares have applied to launch XRP exchange-traded funds in recent months. At the same time, issuers have refiled a batch of previously rejected Solana ETF applications earlier this month. The filings form part of a broader crypto ETF boom under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, with issuers also applying to launch funds tracking the prices of Chainlink, Cardano, and Polkadot, as well as newer meme coins such as Official Trump (TRUMP) and BONK.
