Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America’s conservatives

By JOSHUA GOODMAN and JULIE CARR SMYTH MIAMI (AP) — When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. The Ohio senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement and the highest political ad spending in U.S. Senate race history, was born in Bogota and has brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year and became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades, speaks Spanish with a U.S. accent and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the senate and given his background in Latin America he could be influential on policy.” Moreno, 58, starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. He’ll be accompanied by Terrance Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who is making his first overseas trip since being confirmed by the Senate last month to head the premier federal narcotics agency. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would’ve handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco you might as well say is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Title: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum reached multi-year highs, breaking decisively above the $4,300 level after several days of strong bullish momentum. This breakout marks Ethereum’s highest level since late 2021, fueled by growing institutional demand, ETF inflows, and expanding on-chain activity. However, fresh market data from CryptoQuant suggests that caution may be warranted in the short term. The all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has climbed to 0.68, approaching historical highs and signaling excessive market-wide leverage. While Binance’s ELR sits lower at 0.52, indicating more measured positioning on the world’s largest exchange, higher relative leverage on other platforms points to elevated speculative activity elsewhere. Ethereum’s price is currently testing a critical resistance zone between $4,020 and $4,060—a historically pivotal area that has often determined whether a rally accelerates or faces a sharp pullback. Adding to the short-term risk profile, Binance netflows have spiked significantly above the all-exchange average, suggesting concentrated inflows that may lead to localized sell pressure, possibly linked to liquidations or arbitrage-driven trades. According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum’s mid-term fundamentals remain strongly bullish despite short-term caution signals. Institutional demand is surging, with US Spot Ethereum ETFs recording a record $726.6 million in daily net inflows, driven by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. This has pushed total ETF holdings above 5 million ETH (valued at approximately $20.3 billion), a milestone that underscores Ethereum’s growing role in institutional portfolios. Beyond ETFs, major players are increasing direct exposure. Ark Invest purchased 30,755 ETH worth $108.57 million, while Fundamental Global allocated $200 million to ETH as part of its treasury strategy. This wave of accumulation reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition. On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture. Transaction volumes are hitting new highs, and staking participation continues to expand, locking up more ETH and reducing circulating supply. Regulatory clarity—such as the SEC closing investigations into liquid staking—has further strengthened structural demand for ETH. Upcoming network upgrades, including Pectra and Fusaka, are set to boost scalability and lower costs. This will enhance Ethereum’s appeal to both developers and enterprises. In the short term, high leverage, key resistance levels, and concentrated exchange inflows pose a risk of sharp volatility. However, the mid-term outlook remains intact, supported by sustained institutional inflows, robust network growth, and technological advancements. Even if near-term corrections occur, these factors should help cap downside pressure and maintain Ethereum’s broader bullish trajectory. Ethereum’s 4-hour chart shows a strong breakout above the key resistance at $3,860, which had capped price action in late July. Following this decisive move, ETH surged past the $4,300 level, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rally was supported by strong bullish momentum, as seen in the steep incline of the 50-period SMA (blue) and the price holding well above the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) SMAs. Currently, ETH is consolidating just below its recent peak, around $4,240, signaling a potential pause before the next move. This consolidation at elevated levels, rather than a sharp retracement, suggests that bulls remain in control. The $3,860–$3,900 zone now acts as a critical support, and a retest could provide a healthy setup for continuation. Volume spikes during the breakout indicate strong buying interest, but the reduced volume in the latest candles suggests the market is waiting for fresh catalysts. A sustained move above $4,300 could open the door toward the $4,450–$4,500 zone, while a breakdown below $3,860 would weaken the bullish structure.

Title: Crypto Exchange Bullish Seeks $4.8B Valuation in Upsized IPO Backed by BlackRock and Ark Invest

Crypto exchange Bullish has raised the size of its initial public offering to $990 million from $629 million, as the company looks to take advantage of a hot market for crypto firms. CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Bullish. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Bullish is aiming to sell 30 million shares at a price of $32 to $33 each, or $990 million and a valuation of $4.8 billion at the top of the range. In a previous filing on Aug. 4, the company had planned to market 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, or about $629 million and a $4.2 billion valuation at the top of the range. Bullish is one of many crypto companies hoping to take advantage of a booming IPO market in the space as the industry is starting to profit from a clearer regulatory framework and investor interest, not to mention sharply higher prices of late for leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was among first to go public in June and has seen its share price skyrocket 93% since. In an earlier filing with the SEC, Bullish disclosed that funds managed by BlackRock and Ark Investment Management have expressed interest to buy $200 million worth of shares of the company at the IPO price. The company, which would trade under the ticker “BLSH” also disclosed that it had posted a net income estimate of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter after reporting losses for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024.

Title: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not?

The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has broken its silence on whether it intends to file for an XRP ETF. This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world’s largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager’s statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC’s filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes “zero” sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock’s statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world’s largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be “real” demand for the spot funds. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year. BlackRock’s failure to file for this ETF now and opt to do so later could prove costly since the pending applications could have the first-mover advantage. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, there is a 95% chance that the SEC approves these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.26, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard’s Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will “redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives.” Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as “a blueprint for a hope-filled future,” while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could “ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most.” Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock, Target, and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, “Heroic Accounting,” we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting’s core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an “extremely high” risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI’s methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world’s poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues “We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits.” But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager’s employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI’s approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm’s measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country’s robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania’s low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI’s method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. “Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous,” write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. “Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment.” Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, “Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, ‘It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.’” Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian’s wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don’t need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Business Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.82 billion after upsizing its initial public offering on Monday, underscoring sustained investor interest in digital assets. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel-backed Bullish's raise, still well below its $9-billion valuation target in a failed 2021 blank-check merger, showcases the expanding role that crypto companies are playing in the momentum built by the IPO markets. "In many cases the initial price range is set well below a company's last private valuation or below what the company had originally hoped for," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX. The crypto sector's recent climb to a $4-trillion market value has boosted public market sentiment.

IRELAND HEAD COACH Scott Bemand has named a 32-player squad for the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup in England. Munster hooker Beth Buttimer is the one uncapped player included, having impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series. Ex-England players Ellena Perry and Nancy McGillivray, and Connacht’s Ivana Kiripati, who were all capped in the warm-up games, also make the final squad. IrishRugby TV / YouTube Christy Haney misses out with a hamstring injury, while Dorothy Wall and Erin King had previously been ruled out with long-term setbacks. Aoife Wafer is named as Ireland continue to sweat on the fitness of the 2025 Six Nations player of the championship. Co-captain Edel McMahon also makes the plane having emerged as an injury concern last week. Advertisement In all, the squad is comprised of 18 forwards and 14 backs and is captained by McMahon and Sam Monaghan. Alex Codling, Denis Fogarty, Larissa Muldoon, James Scaysbrook and Gareth Steenson make up Bemand’s coaching team. Uncapped U20 hooker Beth Buttimer. Ben Brady / INPHO Ben Brady / INPHO / INPHO “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Ireland face Japan in their opener on Sunday, 24 August at Franklin’s Gardens, Northampton. They also meet Spain and New Zealand in Pool A as they return to the showpiece tournament for the first time since hosting in 2017. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us,” McMahon added. “Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought for ever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us — it’s the spirit we carry onto the field. Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind.” Edel McMahon and Scott Bemand.

Title: Ireland name one uncapped player in World Cup squad

Time Published: 2025-08-11T09:02:15Z

Only time will tell if Aoife Wafer’s selection by Irish women’s rugby coach Scott Bemand was a calculated risk or not. Perhaps Ireland’s most influential player, Wafer has been included among the 18 forwards and 14 backs selected ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England, which begins for Ireland in Franklin’s Garden in a few weeks. The 22-year-old, who underwent knee surgery in July after sustaining the injury against Wales, has been central to the Irish team and hopes to be fit for the World Cup Pool C opener against Japan on August 24th. An outstanding backrow, Wafer was named 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship, but missed Ireland’s two recent warm-up games against Scotland and Canada. Clearly the Irish medics believe she can play a role at some point in the tournament. After Japan, Ireland play against Spain on August 31st and title holders New Zealand on September 7th in the remaining pool games. Japan are ranked 11th and Spain 13th to Ireland’s fifth on the world table. Defending champions New Zealand are ranked third in the world behind first placed England and Canada, who beat Ireland 26-47 last weekend in Belfast. Wafer’s power game has been a critical aspect of Ireland’s play as highlighted in scoring four tries in the Six Nations. But she missed the last game of the championship against Scotland and has been unavailable since then. Edel McMahon, who co-captain’s the squad with secondrow Sam Monaghan, is also among the 32 names. The backrow also injured her knee and did not feature against Scotland or Canada. [ Scott Bemand happy with how Ireland are shaping up for Rugby World Cup despite Canada defeatOpens in new window ] Backrows Dorothy Wall (Achilles) and the dynamic Erin King (knee) also miss out on selection due to injury as does Christy Haney. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury, and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for them since 2020 and satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations. She is Irish-qualified via a grandparent and plays with Neve Jones and Monoghan at Gloucester. Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, is another of the selected players, who was named in England squads in the past but was never capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She became available to make the switch after her England contract expired in June. Ireland will undoubtedly miss the injured players. King started at openside flanker in Ireland’s opening three Six Nations matches. Wall had involvement in all five games, playing in the secondrow and backrow, while Haney came off the bench in all the matches. Bemand has also picked one uncapped player, hooker Beth Buttimer as well as two players with one cap, Perry and McGillivray and one player with two caps, forward Ivana Kiripati. [ Ivana Kiripati: ‘I am a Samoan girl, born in New Zealand, doing life in Ireland – how cool is that?’Opens in new window ] The overall look of the side tends towards inexperience when compared to the England squad, who have a couple of players with over 100 caps and several more approaching that number. No Irish player selected has yet reached 50 caps with just five players with 30 or more. But Ireland travel with hope and some momentum, having come from behind to beat Scotland and then finished strongly in the second half of their match against Canada after trailing 33-7 at the interval. “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Co-captain Monaghan added that having missed out on qualification for the last World Cup in New Zealand, the energy and hope within the group remains high. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us – it’s the spirit we carry on to the field,” she said. “Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us. Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought forever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country.” In an expanded 16 team competition, countries are divided into four pools of four teams (pools A to D). Teams in each pool will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ireland are eyeing a knockout position in Pool C, which means winning the pool or finishing second. The favourites to top the pool are New Zealand.

Michael Glennon RTÉ Sport Journalist Aoife Wafer and co-captain Edel McMahon have been named in the Ireland squad for the Rugby World Cup, however, Christy Haney misses out through injury. Six Nations player of the tournament Wafer underwent knee surgery last month but the back row has been included in the 32-player squad for Pool C games against Japan, Spain and New Zealand in England, starting on 24 August. Flanker McMahon missed both of Ireland's warm-up games with a knee injury but is also included. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada in Belfast. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for the Red Roses since 2020 and is Irish-qualified via a grandparent. Similarly, centre Nancy McGillivray, whose father is Irish, makes the cut having switched from the England set-up recently. The Exeter player (below) scored on her international debut against Scotland nine days ago. Flanker Ivana Kiripati, who won caps against Scotland and Canada, also makes the cut but there is no place for Deirbhile Nic a Bháird. There is one uncapped player in the squad, with Munster hooker Beth Buttimer, who impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series, getting the call-up. Forwards Erin King and Dorothy Wall had already been ruled out due to injuries picked up in the Six Nations. Head coach Scott Bemand said: "When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Timeline to $500 Outlined by Experts, But This Play Could Yield Superior Returns In The Interim

Solana price looks primed for a surge in the next few weeks as recent price patterns show it responding to new demand pressure. However, another project is unfolding into the spotlight with the potential to steal the shine from the Solana price prediction. Solana’s standout performance this year has attracted hundreds of whales, driving price growth that could see it at 2x this year. Whereas, while Solana price prediction suggests an incoming 2x before year-end, this other altcoin is projected for 30x in the same time frame. Here is the whole gist on why this could happen even before November. The price action indicates that the SOL price is rapidly recovering from its earlier correction a few months ago and is now poised for a significant breakout. According to the analysis, the Solana price prediction is set at around $500 this year as renewed ETF sentiment fuels institutional demand. The trending Solana price prediction sees the ongoing ETF calls as a catalyst that could see the coin double in price before the year’s end. There is an aggressive accumulation currently ongoing in the Solana ecosystem as new fundamental factors add to its visibility. New utilities such as the Solana PayPal stablecoin integration are boosting demand today. In addition, top brands like Blackrock and Fidelity keeping Solana in their reserve have further renewed hope of Solana’s continuous growth. Solana price prediction speculates a $500 growth this year as it continues to hold a position above the 200EMA. This reflects a long-term bullish momentum that could drive the SOL price to a new high by September as it reclaims old resistance. The price has maintained a position above the $165 resistance in the past few weeks, even in the face of a market drawdown. A breakout of the SOL price beyond $200 this week might see it returning to $294 as new support. Furthermore, the Solana price prediction could be achieved this year if it can hit $350b by early September. This move could fuel a new FOMO rally that can help the Solana price hit $500 as early as November. While Solana price action shows strong bullish potential, analysts say Remittix could hit 30x easily this year. This is because Remittix’s crypto-to-fiat and low-cap potential show promise to drive a strong bull run before December. The last few weeks have seen Remittix become the favourite new entry, raising $18.7 million in a short period. Analysts are saying this fast climb is showing strong market confidence in Remittix utility and could be prime for 30x before December. Remittix growth factors this year include: These catalysts have been fueling a high demand lately as anticipation grows for the Remittix breakout.

Title: LendingClub CEO Warns Americans Underestimate Credit Card Interest Costs

Highlights LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn says that the personal loan market is at its highest TAM ever as consumers face rising interest rates on credit card products and rising prices on everything they buy. LendingClub is moving from lender to a comprehensive financial ecosystem amid rekindled marketing efforts. Sanborn tells Karen Webster that new products like LevelUp Checking offer cash back on essentials and loan payments, while LevelUp Savings incentivizes consistent savings behavior. LendingClub’s latest quarter showed robust originations and profit growth, and marketplace support by heavy hitters like BlackRock.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said more than half of consumers don’t know the interest rates on their credit cards. Among those who claim to know their rates, half underestimate what they’re actually paying. The findings come from LendingClub’s internal research, as credit card interest rates have risen to the high-20% range while essential expenses continue to outpace income growth over the past two decades. Credit card revolving balances have reached record levels during this period. “Add in the inflationary pressure, which doesn’t seem to be going away as fast as anyone would like,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster during a Monday Conversation session. “It’s putting pressure on consumers, who are managing…but things are tight.” Sanborn said the conditions have created the largest total addressable market for personal loans that the company has seen. LendingClub estimates that 52% of Americans are currently carrying credit card debt at historically high interest rates. LendingClub began as a peer-to-peer lending platform in 2006 before acquiring Radius Bank in 2020. Sanborn said the bank acquisition was a key strategic move to empower consumers to make what he called “smart financial decisions” and transform the company’s operations into a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Following a strong second quarter reported at the end of July, the company reactivated key marketing channels that had been curtailed during interest rate shifts and the 2023 banking crisis. These channels include online advertising, display ads, paid search, and direct mail campaigns. “Our early results came in stronger than we expected,” Sanborn said, attributing the performance to the significant interest rate savings LendingClub can offer to consumers carrying high-rate credit card debt. LevelUp Checking launched just over a month ago with features designed to reward responsible financial behavior. The account offers 1% cash back on essential purchases, including gas, groceries, and pharmaceuticals, plus 1% annual percentage yield on account balances and 2% cash back for customers who make on-time loan payments. The cash back on loan payments effectively reduces the interest rate customers pay on their loans. Since the product launch, sign-ups increased sixfold compared to previous account opening rates. Approximately 60% of new checking accounts have come from existing borrowers who are setting up direct deposits and automated loan payments, indicating strong cross-selling success between LendingClub’s lending and banking operations. LevelUp Savings has attracted $2.7 billion in deposits in what Sanborn described as a short period. The savings product offers higher interest rates for customers who maintain consistent saving behavior over time. “These offerings are good for the consumer, better than the competition, and best when they’re used together,” Sanborn explained, referring to the integrated approach across checking, savings, and lending products. The banking product growth is being supported by what Sanborn called robust momentum in the company’s core lending businesses. Second-quarter loan originations rose 32% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this growth to strong credit performance among existing loans and high demand from institutional loan buyers. LendingClub has maintained what Sanborn described as “a pretty cautious credit stance” that has contributed to more than four years of outperformance relative to competitors. The company’s current approval rates are approximately one-third lower than the levels maintained before inflation began affecting borrower finances. When the interest rate environment first shifted upward, asset management companies that had been buying loans from LendingClub’s marketplace moved to the sidelines because their cost of capital increased dramatically. “So we pivoted to banks,” Sanborn explained. “And we went upstream in terms of credit we were sourcing, because that’s what bank buyers want.” This pivot toward higher-quality borrowers proved beneficial when the 2023 banking crisis occurred. “Luckily we were ‘up’ credit at the time when inflationary pressures were also hitting borrowers,” Sanborn said. “That really benefited us and we’re selling that higher quality credit now to both banks and asset managers.” The conservative underwriting approach has enabled LendingClub to maintain strong loan performance even as economic conditions have created stress for many borrowers across the industry. In its core business of refinancing credit card debt, LendingClub directly pays off customers’ existing card balances rather than providing cash to borrowers. This process ensures the funds are used as intended for debt consolidation and prevents customers from accumulating additional debt on top of their new personal loan. “If you tell us you’re going to pay off your credit card debt, we say, great,” Sanborn explained. “Here are your cards…we will pay those directly for you.” This approach helps consumers reduce their overall cost of debt while maintaining the same total debt level, consolidating multiple credit card accounts into a single point of interaction through the LendingClub platform. LendingClub recently announced a significant partnership with BlackRock that includes a structured certificate product with an investment-grade rating from Fitch Ratings. Sanborn described BlackRock as a “blue chip counterpart” for the partnership. The BlackRock deal includes up to $1 billion in forward flow commitments for future loan purchases, initially targeting lower-cost capital sources such as insurance companies. This partnership is designed to help power LendingClub’s online marketplace for loan sales to institutional investors. Sanborn said these partnerships distinguish LendingClub from what he called “episodic entrants” in the lending market who “come in with guns blazing using inferred bureau models” without the depth of experience that comes from extended market presence. He noted that LendingClub has two decades of operating experience, dozens of internal credit models, and $100 billion in loan originations over 17 years of operations. This track record, according to Sanborn, provides advantages over newer competitors that rely primarily on standard credit bureau data and models. The company is developing what Sanborn called a proprietary “dynamic application” system that will control LendingClub’s full mobile technology stack. Unlike most banks that rely on third-party technology solutions, LendingClub’s internally controlled system is intended to enable more data-driven, customer-focused experiences. Additionally, the company is building a mobile marketing platform to support customer acquisition and engagement efforts. These technology investments are part of LendingClub’s broader strategy to differentiate its customer experience from traditional banking and lending competitors. “We’re really pleased with the progress we’re making,” Sanborn told Webster. “We’re very bullish on the future of LendingClub and we’re running ahead of our own expectations, which is great.” The company’s strong second-quarter performance and successful product launches have exceeded internal projections, according to Sanborn, positioning LendingClub for continued growth in what the CEO sees as an expanding market opportunity driven by consumer financial pressures and limited awareness of debt costs.

IRELAND’S LATEST RISING star in athletics, Conor Kelly, has confirmed he will follow in Rhasidat Adeleke’s footsteps by attending the University of Texas. Kelly collected his 400m gold medal at the European U20 championships today, having stormed to victory in yesterday’s race, clocking a new U20 national record of 45.83 seconds while he was at it. Speaking today to Athletics Ireland after stepping off the podium, Kelly said, “I couldn’t stop smiling, it was incredible. I was probably up a little later than I should’ve been. I woke up a little late, not much sleep…This is the last week before I go to Texas (for college) so I better get a good goodbye in.” Advertisement Kelly raced alongside Adeleke in the mixed 4x400m at the world relay championships in May. Today marked the final day of the championships in Tampere, Finland, with Sean Cronin (1500m) and the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team finishing eighth in their respective finals. Racing in a stacked, tactical 1500m final. Clonliffe Harriers clubman Cronin dug deep down the home straight to cross the line in 3:50.80. “I’m really proud of how I ran that race. I think I got as much out of it as I could have,” he told Athletics Ireland. “I’m delighted with the progression I’ve made this season, I think I’ve really stepped up. I’ve not just trained harder; I’ve trained smarter and done all the little things right in between.” An hour earlier, the Women’s 4x100m relay team of Fatima Amusan (Leevale AC), Molly Daly (Kilkenny City Harriers), Leila Colfer (St Laurence O’Toole AC) and Precious Akpe-Moses (Blackrock AC) clocked a time of 45.17 seconds in finishing eighth in their relay final, which was faster than their heat time. Akpe-Moses – who was racing at these championships for the eighth time, having made the finals of both the 100m and 200m – reflected on her performance and that of the team with pride. “It’s been a long championship,” she said. “We made it to the final, did what we could do, and we’re satisfied.” After a long two days of competition, Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) finished 17th in the Women’s Heptathlon with 4693 points. Silkena was in action in the Long Jump (5.63m), Javelin Throw (39.48m) and 800m (2:30.19) today. Seamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) was unable to finish the final of the Men’s 10,000m Race Walk due to injury.

Title: Ethereum surges with $461M ETF inflows – Will ETH break its ATH?

With BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the buying spree, Ethereum’s breakout looks increasingly credible. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum as institutional ETF inflows surpass Bitcoin. Bullish metrics and rising open interest point to growing confidence in ETH, bringing it within an achievable distance of a new all-time high. Ethereum [ETH] just stole the spotlight from Bitcoin [BTC]. ETF inflows have flipped the usual script, on-chain trends are pointing up, and big players are quietly piling in. But will ETH be able to sustain this breakout and go further? ETFs are snapping up more Ethereum than Bitcoin, with a recent single-day haul of $461 million in ETH products compared to $404 million for BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence. Source: Arkham Intelligence The surge was led by institutional titans – BlackRock scooped up $250 million worth of ETH, Fidelity added $130 million, and Grayscale followed with $60 million. In fact, this was one of the strongest single-day institutional buying waves ETH has seen this year. Glassnode data revealed a sharp rise in first-time buyers and momentum traders, pushing new demand higher. Source: Glassnode Having said that, conviction buyers – those raising their cost basis despite elevated prices – also grew, signaling deeper market commitment. On top of that, this mix of fresh inflows and seasoned holder conviction could set the stage for an aggressive leg upward if buying pressure sustains. At press time, Ethereum’s derivatives market is heating up, with Futures Open Interest sitting at $51.61 billion – near a yearly high. Source: CoinGlass Price action remained strong despite a minor pullback, with ETH trading at $4,190, above its 9- and 21-day EMAs. Momentum indicators added to the bullish bias: RSI hovered just below overbought territory at 69.8, while MACD remained firmly positive. Source: TradingView With less than $700 to reclaim its $4,891 all-time high, ETH’s current structure suggests a shot at price discovery this year. Of course, profit-taking could slow the climb before any decisive breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Inside the mind of Lyn Alden: Bitcoin, AI, and the unstoppable deficit train

Renowned macro analyst Lyn Alden shares her views on fiscal deficits, 'sticky' inflation, Bitcoin cycles, and the remarkable 20-watt human brain. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Lyn Alden is an exceptional human. Broadly recognized as one of the top minds in macroeconomics, during a conversation with Lyn, you can feel some of her vast intellect rubbing off on you; I swear my IQ increased several points by the time our chat was over. Even navigating heavy topics like the fiscal deficit and the onset of AI, she does so with a smile on her face and more eloquence and poise than an Olympic gymnast executing a triple backflip. Founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy and general partner at venture firm Ego Death Capital, alongside other industry heavyweights like Jeff Booth and Preston Pysh, Lyn has earned her stripes over the years as one of the most respected macro analysts in the space. She’s also one of the most solicited for interviews, thanks to her razor-sharp insights and depth of market knowledge. As a prolific content creator, Lyn offers a free investing newsletter and frequents the virtual corridors of Crypto Twitter daily, amassing three-quarters of a million followers who rely on her timely commentary and finely-edged wit: beyond the undeniable words of wisdom and investment advice, Lyn’s something of a master when it comes to memes. Lyn is perhaps best known for her book Broken Money, which provides a comprehensive view of the history of money and a well-illustrated critique of the global monetary system. She’s also highly vocal about her thesis on the U.S. fiscal deficit, AKA, ‘Nothing stops this train’. Sky-high levels of U.S. spending are rising at a pace that far outstrips the government’s ability to pay for it, creating what Lyn dubs a “slow-motion runaway train.” She explains: “Large U.S. fiscal deficits are going to continue for the foreseeable future, five, 10 years, any sort of investable time horizon. There are a bunch of reasons why, and a lot of them have to do with political polarization. It’s very hard to either massively raise taxes or massively cut spending in a very polarized situation, as well as mechanically the kind of debt levels they find themselves in.” The total amount of money the U.S. government owes to its lenders currently amounts to an eye-watering $36.9 trillion, representing over 120% of GDP, and growing by around $1 trillion every quarter. Even the most highly skilled ringmaster with smoke and mirrors would struggle to obfuscate such an alarming level of federal debt. With a diminishing ability to pay it off, I wonder, if nothing stops this train, can anything slow it down? She replies: “There are plenty of things that can slow it down a little bit. Tariffs are one of the things that can slow it down because they bypass some of that polarization. Tariffs are basically really big tax hikes that go around Congress because of an emergency authorization executive order, so they temporarily bypass some of the frictions against them.” While tariffs may serve to fill the government coffers a little higher, Lyn says the numbers don’t add up enough to make a significant impact: the deficit is around $2 trillion, and the income from tariffs at the current level only equates to roughly a quarter of it at around $500 billion a year. Plus, “we’re already seeing exemptions.” She adds: “The last line for the ‘Nothing stops this train’ view is that the U.S. is very financialized, meaning that our government’s tax receipts are very correlated with asset prices. Any attempts at austerity at this point tend to fail to address the problem because you either slow down the stock market or slow down the economy. Therefore, with a lag, you weaken your other tax receipts and make deficit reduction on a sustained basis hard.” I nod, contemplating the enormity of the situation and the inevitable collision course the economy is on. She continues: “Just structurally, it’s growing above target almost without any way to stop it.” We turn the conversation to last week’s market slump following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that triggered former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes to sell off a chunk of his crypto holdings. I ask Lyn how significant the jobs report is and whether she echoes Hayes’ bearish near-term views on global liquidity. She frowns, pointing out that Hayes is more of a frequent trader than she is, however: “The jobs report was pretty significant. It was the biggest downward revision in quite a while, and it’s corroborated by other things as well. The ISM Purchasing Managers’ indices are also showing a similar directional weakness.” The ISM Manufacturing PMI is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy as it signals the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at U.S. factories. Lyn continues: “Now, whether that affects Bitcoin and broader crypto, I’m more hesitant to say. While it can slow down earnings that can impair the economy in various ways, it also generally means more Fed dovishness, which, around the margins, is good for Bitcoin and crypto.” Despite not making short-term trading decisions like Hayes, Lyn gives some credence to his outlook over the coming quarters based on a couple of parameters: Tariffs may make a dent in the deficit and serve to take the wind out of crypto’s sails (“slightly slower the train for a couple of quarters”), and the treasury is attempting to refill its general cash account (the TGA) after the debt ceiling was passed. That means sucking liquidity out of the system, which can negatively impact risk assets. Lyn explains: “Ironically, debt ceilings, when they’re an issue, are actually good for liquidity because they force all these pockets of liquidity to go back into the market, but then afterward, when they refill their cash levels, they’re pulling cash out of the system. They [the treasury] expect to do that through the rest of this quarter, to Arthur’s point, which is historically not amazing for asset prices across the board.” In contrast, Lyn isn’t too worried about a broader tightening of global liquidity. She says: “I would say liquidity’s in a middling place because the dollar is no longer falling as it was earlier this year, and the dollar is a really big variable for liquidity, generally. A falling dollar is overall good for global liquidity. At the other end of the spectrum, China’s credit impulse is on the upswing, which is good for global liquidity. So it’s kind of neutral at the current time.” While it’s not the perfect setup for a million-dollar Bitcoin, things could definitely be worse. Lyn affirms: “I don’t think this cycle’s over yet. I think we’re going to see higher highs in Bitcoin this cycle. That could be later this year. That could be early next year. There are lots of little variables that can affect that, but so far, we don’t see any indicators that look like a multi-year top.” In fact, she explains that we’re “nowhere near multi-year tops” based on various indicators that track market value compared to on-chain cost basis, a “kind of a measure of euphoria.” “I think liquidity still looks decent, maybe not great for a quarter, but it’s not an acute headwind per se, in my opinion, and going into next year, I still think we’re going to see most likely higher Bitcoin prices.” How high is that? Lyn pauses and says she has no firm view. Unlike other personalities in the space, she doesn’t win over more followers by making outlandish predictions. Instead, she simply says: “I think we’re going over $150k this cycle. Now the number could be much higher than that, but I always try to start conservatively, and it depends on market conditions at that time.” She believes that Bitcoin cycles are changing, and we should expect this one to be longer and “maybe less extreme” than previous runs. We should also prepare to see strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” “If you look at what used to be called FANG stocks, and now it’s the Mag7 stocks, basically large-cap U.S. tech stocks, they kept grinding up longer than people thought. Value investors were always shocked that these things just kept growing. “Sometimes they get over their skis and have a 30% correction, sometimes worse. Sometimes they have a flattish, choppy year, but then they keep grinding higher after they work out some steam. I think Bitcoin could resemble that model to some extent. Maybe it’s still more volatile than that, but I do think we should expect maybe longer and less extreme cycles on average.” For anyone who’s been flushed out by a Mt. Gox, China ban, or FTX-style black swan event that abruptly reversed most of Bitcoin’s gains, Lyn’s prediction may provide some relief. But is there any potential catalyst for the end of the cycle quietly chirping away like a canary in a coal mine? Bitcoin treasury companies, for example? Lyn points out that now that Bitcoin is a multitrillion-dollar asset, it’s inevitable that smart money flows in. She says: “There’s no world in which only individuals own Bitcoin and magically no large pools of capital want to own it. That only makes sense when Bitcoin is a tiny market.” She’s not concerned about the centralization threat to Bitcoin posed by entities like Strategy gobbling up BTC like it’s going out of style (Strategy’s BTC holdings currently stand at over 628,791, just shy of 3% of the entire supply). She simply shrugs and says it’s no different from previous cycles: “At one point, Mt. Gox supposedly had over 800,000 coins, and there were fewer coins back then. So that was a bigger percentage of coins than, say, BlackRock or Strategy has now. So while there’s always some degree of centralization concerns, it’s really not worse now than it was at periods of times in the past. So, no. I’m not really worried about that from a centralization perspective.” What is important to be on the lookout for, Lyn explains, is the amount of leverage in the system, since “any degree of euphoria and leverage is what causes the next downward cycle.” Bitcoin needs upward volatility to go from zero to trillions of dollars of value and become relevant on a global scale; and upward volatility, Lyn warns, breeds euphoria and leverage. “That’s when you get over your skis and you get consolidations and downside volatility. There are obviously other liquidations that happen from time to time, so they certainly could feed the next downturn, but I don’t view it as fundamentally different from prior cycles, and the current leverage in the treasury space is not that high. MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We’ll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we’ll see a washout. We’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.” It was sometime during the COVID lockdowns that Lyn began discussing the persistent inflation that would stem from shuttering the world and inflating the money supply. She would later characterize the 2020s as the decade of inflation, as governments struggle to rein in rising costs. Does Lyn expect this trend to continue? “To some extent, I mean, we’re in 2025. We’re still above the way the Fed measures inflation. We’re still above their official target even though it has come down. Now, whether or not we have another dramatic spike comes partially down to whether energy is constrained or not. It’s pretty hard to have major inflation without energy suppression, so anything that keeps the supply of energy high is a way of keeping inflation down.” Unlike previous decades, she says, where we were able to print money and offset it with productivity gains from automating manufacturing, she sees the 2020s as “stickier” in terms of average inflation; unless we realize a major productivity increase through a technology such as AI, although even that won’t bring down the cost of store-of-value assets. She says: “The things that are truly scarce, like waterfront property, gold, fine art, high-quality stocks, and things like that, all go up dramatically because it’s hard to increase those things. So I think going forward, AI making, say, white collar types of services cheaper can suppress in some way CPI and certain wages and expenditures that people have. This could be offset by ongoing money printing, higher gold, higher Bitcoin, higher prestige properties, and just truly scarce things. So I do think that we’re still in a sticky inflation environment, even though it’s hard to get dramatic inflation without energy shortages.” Since she’s brought up AI for its productivity gains, I ask if she’s concerned about job losses and whether she believes it’s a net positive for humanity, being something of an AI skeptic myself. Lyn’s markedly more optimistic. Just like the runaway fiscal deficit train, she says AI is inevitable. “At this stage, if you try to ban it in one country, another will do it, and it will be open-sourced in some capacity. Like any technology, it can be disruptive when it hits; a lot of people can lose their jobs at once.” She likens AI to social media in the way the latter disrupted social interaction, and warns that it must be used carefully to avoid doing more harm than good. I recall reading an MIT study, to her point, that found AI to be a great learning tool; as long as people didn’t become so dependent on it that their intelligence drained away like blood from an open wound. Lyn continues: “It’s a good thing that we find ways to make repetitive white-collar work cheaper and more affordable because that allows those people or future generations to do other types of work, which is true for any time we automated textiles or farming with tractors and hydrocarbons and things like that. It’s the same thing except it’s quicker.” She points out that portable AI is different from data center AI and marvels at the mechanics of the human brain: our ability to process complex thoughts and emotions, “very high bandwidth senses,” and “self-healing” capability run on just 20 watts of power. She enthuses: “It’s remarkable. It’s less than an incandescent light bulb. The equivalent amount of processing in a data center runs on megawatts of power, so millions of watts of power… I don’t think we’re anywhere near the level where there’s nothing humans could do to add value over silicon. I think it’s more a case of disruption that then puts more people into doing other things.” I nod, wondering whether my metaphorical lightbulb requires as much energy as Lyn Alden’s giant brain. With persistent inflation, societal disruption, and broken money, to boot, this era bears all the hallmarks of a fourth turning, and I struggle to feel positive about where it all ends. I wonder what Lyn thinks. Is this a good time to be alive? She ponders: “I think so. Fewer people die from avoidable things than almost ever before globally. It’s not an accident that the population bubble is happening now… For the most part, I consider it good, but it goes through waves of getting too much, like when people get cut off from social connections. People have way more depression now than hunter-gatherers, even though in most capacities, we live longer and are less likely to die from something random… Technology is polarizing because, in some ways, it becomes like a winner-take-most, and to the extent that we get through this whole thing successfully, I think we have to learn to use technology in a more natural way than be so reliant on it. I think eventually that will be the case.” Lyn also believes that AI won’t continue to develop and improve ad infinitum, but will eventually hit a plateau, just like aviation did: progress within that industry has been fairly stagnant for years, following its mind-blowing takeoff in the 20th Century. She says: “We went from the Wright brothers to people on the moon in one human lifetime. But then, once we hit the 70s, we slowed down. We still don’t have a jet faster than the Blackbird. We still don’t have commercial aviation faster than the Concorde. We don’t even have that anymore… I think in time, similar things will happen to electronics where we’ll reach certain densities that are hard to keep dramatically improving on, and it will allow us more time to absorb what we already have.” Follow Lyn Alden on X or check out lynalden.com for in-depth analysis and insights.

Title: Futures-Based SOL & XRP ETFs Take In $1 Billion Capital Since Launch — Spot ETFs Next?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/futures-sol-xrp-etfs-take-in-1-billion-capital/
Time Published: 2025-08-10T15:30:52Z

The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago—around March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares’ Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July—where they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. In a second post on X, Geraci reiterated his belief that BlackRock would be looking to expand its crypto ETF portfolio. “And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?” the ETF expert said, referring to the attention being enjoyed by the future-based version of the XRP exchange-traded fund.

Title: U.S. Spot XRP ETFs: Five Possible Reasons Behind BlackRock’s Hesitation to File for One

BlackRock has made bold moves into bitcoin and ether ETFs, but on Friday, the asset manager said it had no immediate plans to file for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), dashing the community’s hopes that its entry could help extend XRP’s 2025 rally. This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock’s absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community’s anticipation of a demand-driven price surge. First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a "long tail" of other crypto services. "I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum," he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22. Second, BlackRock’s strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. The firm’s conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token’s spot price. Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application. Fourth, the XRP community’s expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock’s data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP’s smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF. Finally, BlackRock’s global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP’s trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock’s ETF presence is less dominant. At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.

Title: BlackRock Says XRP And SOL ETFs Not In The Cards Despite Long-Running Ripple-SEC Case Officially Ending

The conclusive end of Ripple’s nearly five-year-long lawsuit indicated the possibility for Wall Street titans such as BlackRock to file to introduce a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. BlackRock, however, has clarified that it has no immediate plans to offer a potential XRP ETF or Solana (SOL) fund. “At this time, BlackRock does not have any plans to file an XRP or SOL ETF,” a BlackRock representative reportedly told The Block on Friday. The clarification came shortly after NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually foray into the XRP ETF market as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple have officially ended their five-year legal battle after jointly withdrawing their appeals in the XRP case. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the filing, with both parties bearing their own legal fees. According to Geraci, it’s hard to justify overlooking crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock avoids issuing other crypto ETFs, they’re basically stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” the pundit added. Geraci noted in a follow-up post that futures-based SOL and XRP exchange-traded funds went live in March and April, respectively, and have since pulled in more than $1 billion in new investor money. While less impactful on price than a spot fund, he believes this is a sign that spot XRP and Solana ETFs, once approved, will attract “real demand.” And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?Ok. Asset managers, including ProShares, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary, and Bitwise, have all submitted paperwork with the SEC for a potential XRP ETF. In June, analysts at Bloomberg upped their odds of spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano ETF approvals getting launched before the end of 2025 to 90%. Meanwhile, Canada is a step ahead. 3iQ’s spot XRP ETFs, XRPQ and XRPQ.U, started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in mid-June, swiftly accumulating roughly $50 million in assets under management, the company proclaimed in a post on X.

Title: What investing in private equity and crypto means for your 401(k)

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Your 401(k) options could change soon. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to clear the way for Americans to invest their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets. It’s a big win for the asset industry — giving financial managers access to some of the $12.2 trillion in Americans’ 401(k) and related retirement plans. Private assets can also be more lucrative, and the Trump administration said they can give retirement savers more opportunities. “The theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,” said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool. But there are higher risks — and not necessarily higher rewards. Critics say it could put people in danger of losing a huge chunk of their retirement savings. “There is a lot less transparency and liquidity in private markets,” said Brokamp. “There’s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments — especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.” Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% — while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%. Right now, private equity is technically allowed in retirement plans, but it’s rare — though some companies like BlackRock are planning new offerings. There are ways people can invest in crypto through their 401(k)s, too, but it’s also not common. And many 401(k) recordkeepers don’t support private equity funds yet. The executive order could change that. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. And it tells the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider ways to facilitate access to alternative assets for plans like 401(k)s. “I think this is going to open the floodgates,” said Schiffrin. “I think up until now, you’ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.” Employers would have to decide to offer the plans — and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. However, with updated guidance from the government, employers may feel more comfortable adding these alternative assets into their 401(k)s. Many experts say that might not be a good thing. SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there’s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. She said she would not advise anyone to make this kind of investment unless they fully understand the risk of losing that money entirely. “It could be detrimental to less-informed investors whose only investment account is their 401(k),” said Tran. “Without proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.” Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses. “I think in practice, there’ll be many fiduciaries who ignore this directive because they understand precisely what will result from it,” he said, referring to Trump’s executive order. “The result will be a massive train wreck where many people are seriously hurt. Their retirement accounts will be annihilated.” And cryptocurrencies come with their own dangers. “It’s not clear what, if any, protections investors are going to have when it comes to investing in crypto,” said Better Markets’ Schiffrin. “So that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.” Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers. “As more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class,” Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of SIFMA, said in a statement. “Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.” He continued: “Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments — appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules — could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.” Experts believe it could take months to see any changes. For now, they say education and safeguards are key — especially for younger investors and people without access to professional financial advice. “There must be transparency, education and limits in place to prevent widespread harm,” said Tran. “Otherwise, we could be setting the stage for not only ﬁnancial loss, but broader economic and social consequences.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Bitcoin Bulls In Control: $120,000 Test Could Trigger Run Toward ATH

Bitcoin (BTC) prices are currently hovering near $118,000 after a modest price recovery in the last week resulted in a 4.17% price gain. With a new week ahead, a top market analyst with X username KillaXBT shares some technical insights on the present Bitcoin market structure and also discusses potential price developments. Related Reading: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details In an X post on August 9, KillaXBT gives a weekly analysis report of the Bitcoin price’s movement for the first week in August while also sharing future projections. In their observations, the market expert notes that Bitcoin started the month on a strong technical footing, flipping the monthly open at $115,752 into support, a move traders often interpret as a bullish signal. However, KillaXBT explains that Bitcoin historically tends to wick either up or down in a new month, forming one side of the monthly candle’s wick in a pattern sometimes referred to by traders as the “monthly open trap.” Therefore, the current setup has market watchers closely monitoring for either a sustained uptrend or a liquidity-driven retracement before continuation. In terms of liquidity, the crypto analyst has also observed that significant 2-week BTC liquidations are building above the $120,000 mark. This zone is also aligned with the previous weekly open ($119,414), creating a high-probability target should bullish structure remain intact. At present, BTC is testing a lower-timeframe (LTF) downtrend line. KillaXBT explains that a confirmed break above this trendline could pave the way for a decisive move toward $120,000 and beyond, while traders remain wary of potential liquidity hunts that could briefly push price lower before resuming the uptrend. Two main scenarios are now emerging for traders. First, BTC could maintain its bullish structure, continuing the climb toward the $120,000 liquidity pool and potentially targeting the $123,186 monthly high (ATH). This path aligns with the current technical structure, which shows no immediate signs of bearish continuation. Alternatively, Bitcoin could fail to break higher, instead forming a lower high and slipping back under $115,700. In such a case, the next major support lies in the $110,000–$112,000 range, marked by the monthly fair value gap (FVG) at $111,955. Presently, KillaXBT believes scenario one appears more likely as the market is holding bullish momentum, and with absent clear bearish signals, the analyst expects BTC to attempt higher highs in the coming days. However, traders should also expect BTC could briefly dip early in the week, particularly Monday or Tuesday, to clear overleveraged long positions before rallying. In rounding off, the market expert states a sustained pattern of higher highs and higher lows on intraday charts would further validate the bullish outlook, while a failure to hold these levels could quickly shift sentiment toward the bearish alternative. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,792 following a 1.11% gain in the last day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Confirms No Current XRP Or Solana Spot ETF Filings

BlackRock has confirmed that the company is not currently pursuing spot ETFs for Ripple’s XRP or Solana, despite market rumors. While the XRP and SOL communities may be disappointed by the lack of immediate action, the acknowledgment from BlackRock validates their relevance in the broader crypto market. In a recent update from The Block, BlackRock has clarified that the company currently has no plans to file for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ripple’s XRP or SOL. This aligns with BlackRock’s cautious approach, as reflected in earlier comments from executives like CEO Larry Fink and CIO Samara Cohen. Both have emphasized their focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. According to MartyParty, the world’s largest asset manager noted that they are actively exploring assets like SOL and XRP for potential future offerings rather than spot ETFs. However, the industry speculation, fueled by analysts like Nate Geraci, suggests that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP Ripple spot ETFs by an October 2025 deadline. This potential move is believed to be driven by mounting competitive pressures in the crypto ETF space and recent regulatory developments. These include the SEC’s approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms, which enhance the efficiency of ETF operations. Furthermore, no official filings have been made yet, and any decision to proceed would likely depend on regulatory clarity. While the ongoing speculation that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP, an analyst known as Web3BPP has also revealed that Ripple has officially closed its nearly five-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Web3BPP stated that the court has confirmed that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. According to the expert, this news has sent the altcoin’s price up by 11% reaching $3.33, capping off a remarkable 31% monthly gain and an impressive nearly 500% increase over the past year. Analysts are now setting their sights on $8 short-term price target for XRP, while some long-term forecasts envision prices soaring as high as $1,000 by 2030, due to their belief that BlackRock could consider filing for a spot XRP ETF by October. A move expected to bring in billions of dollars in fresh institutional capital. The expert also drew attention to Ethereum, which has gained 7% this week, reaching $3,908, driven largely by whale buying and expanding adoption by corporate treasuries. This surge reflects growing confidence in ETH as both a store of value and a strategic asset for businesses. Market experts are bullish on ETH’s future, with many projecting a price target of $5,000 by the end of the year. This rally is expected to be supported by interest in ETH-based ETFs and upcoming network upgrades designed to enhance performance and security. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock To File For XRP ETF After Ripple-SEC Settlement? Market Expert Answers

Ripple Labs and the US SEC have finally closed the book on their high-profile lawsuit after almost five years of legal back-and-forth. According to a joint filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, both sides agreed to drop their appeals, making Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling final. The resolution has already been factored into XRP’s price surge above $3 again. It has also led to an interesting speculation from market expert Nate Geraci, who suggested that BlackRock may now look to file for an iShares XRP ETF. The end of the case immediately prompted discussion about whether BlackRock, Wall Street’s biggest asset manager, will launch a Spot XRP ETF. Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared on X that he believes BlackRock may have been waiting for this moment before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. “Makes zero sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth,” he wrote. According to him, limiting exposure to just Bitcoin and Ethereum would be like saying they’re the only assets that will ever matter. That stance is very questionable given the altcoin’s price performance since last year. Given BlackRock’s success with its Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETF is the logical next step, as the third-largest cryptocurrency. If BlackRock were to launch an XRP ETF, it could be a game-changer for the token’s price performance. At the time of writing, BlackRock holds the largest share of assets in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. The firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has dominated inflows since launch and is currently holding $86.53 billion in net assets. Furthermore, its iShares Ethereum Trust has quickly become the leader among Ethereum ETFs with $12.35 billion in net assets. Polymarket now puts the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 76%, although it reached as high as 88.7% on August 8. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas is leaning on the cautious side. In response to Nate Geraci’s post, Balchunas disagreed and noted that the firm is likely satisfied with its existing crypto offerings. He doesn’t expect one to be filed this year, but the longer-term outlook is harder to call. It appears BlackRock is in no rush to expand its ETF lineup for now. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block on Friday that the company currently has no plans for a spot XRP ETF, or one for Solana. However, that doesn’t mean the door is closed forever. XRP’s price jumped more than 11% on the news of the settlement. Its price went from $3.04 and jumped to $3.36 in just a few hours after news of the settlement broke out. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $3.32. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tokens that are designed to be digital twins of stocks have subtle differences that make them less identical and more fraternal to the securities they're supposed to replicate. Tokenization was theoretical when BlackRock chief Larry Fink publicly discussed it in early 2024, but has landed in the real world via popular trading platforms including Robinhood (HOOD), Kraken and Coinbase Global (COIN). While they haven't cleared regulatory hurdles for U.S. investors' yet, rollouts of stock tokens in Europe started in June, ratcheting up the competition between trading venues that offer, or plan to offer, them to their customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who unveiled the crypto exchange's tokenization ambitions in late July, quantified the business case for it: Just 3% in equities trading market share would double the current crypto market. "We've always said we're updating the system and building the bridge to bring equities on to crypto rails is the next phase of our strategy," he said. Anything can be made into tokens, from mortgage contracts representing real estate to shares in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that reference the price of the underlying assets—whether they are publicly traded stocks or stakes in private companies, the latter of which made headlines when Robinhood unveiled OpenAI and SpaceX stock tokens. Robinhood chief Vlad Tenev, during the company's recent earnings call, said that the true opportunity in tokenization is in inaccessible assets like private market assets, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. He also said there was a "very positive" reception to stock tokens. "It's clear customers want this," he said. "They not only want it in Europe but they want it in the U.S. as well." OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, has publicly said that it was not associated with the OpenAI stock tokens launched by Robinhood. The private-asset "stock tokens" weren't technically equity, but derivative contracts. Kraken, the U.S.'s oldest crypto exchange, has taken a different tack to tokenization. It partnered with a company called Backed to roll out xStocks. They trade on Solana and BNB Chain, but will likely show up on other blockchains as the so-called xStocks Alliance, a network of exchanges and decentralized finance protocols, grows. Kraken's consumer business chief Mark Greenberg, in an interview with Investopedia, said that the exchange's stock tokens aren't derivatives, but "actually backed by real stocks." As Greenberg explained it: Its partner Backed runs an SPV in New Jersey that holds stocks, and for each stock an investor buys, they mint a corresponding token, which they destroy when the underlying stock is sold, and the cash value given to the user. They are not technically equity but debt instruments that grant their holders the right to the cash value of the underlying shares, but not the shares themselves. Kraken hopes to eventually enable XStocks holders to redeem the underlying assets rather than their cash value, Greenberg said. Coinbase may come up with a whole different model, but the crypto exchange has not yet set a timeline. That said, U.S. securities regulators appear to be more receptive to them than they were in the past.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has seen its price rocket higher this year, topping an explosive 2024 that saw Wall Street charge into crypto—though some are predicting the bitcoin price bull run could be just getting started. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year, with the crypto market looking “eerily similar” to the situation last summer that catapulted bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies including ethereum and XRP higher. Now, as JPMorgan suddenly flips on what could be a bitcoin price game-changer, U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will make it easier for bitcoin, crypto and other alternative assets like private equity and real estate to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts—which hold a combined $12.2 trillion. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits," a White House fact sheet read. Trump signing the long-rumored order has boosted the bitcoin price, pushing it toward $120,000 per bitcoin for the first time since last month, while ethereum has surged 21% this week, breaking back above $4,000 per ether for the first time since December last year. XRP, one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies over the last year with a near 500% gain, has climbed 12% this week, helping the combined crypto market top $4 trillion. “This could mark a major milestone in bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial infrastructure, opening the door to long-term adoption by everyday Americans,” Anthony Agoshkov, cofounder of Marvel Capital, said in emailed comments. The order gives the Department of Labor 180 days to review rules with any changes not expected to be seen immediately in bitcoin and crypto markets. “The Trump executive order opening the door to the inclusion of crypto and private assets in 401(k) retirement plans opens the way to greater choice and gives investors more options," Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at Sygnum Bank, said via email. “It is another bullish driver for the crypto market as the relatively small market capitalisation means fund flows can have a significant impact on price." In May, the Department of Labor scrapped guidance from 2022 that urged "extreme care" before any investment companies added crypto to retirement account options. “The announcement has fueled optimism around future institutional inflows, especially given the size of the U.S. defined contribution market, which totals around $10 trillion," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. "A more favorable regulatory tone is taking shape in Washington. The Trump executive order follows a series of signals from lawmakers aimed at establishing clearer guardrails around digital asset classification and access.” While there is currently no prohibition on retirement plan operators adding these types of investments, the order is expected to result in a more diverse range of options for people. “This order isn’t about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.’ It’s about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said in an emailed note. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The latest bullish signal out of the Trump White House—following Trump dismantling Biden-era crypto restrictions on Wall Street, Trump ordering the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile that’s expected to include ethereum and XRP among others, and the passage of the Genius Act stablecoin bill—are helping to “shift sentiment” among traders, but have yet to translate into meaningful price moves. “Trump’s latest moves—from expanding 401(k) access to crypto, to pushing gold into the spotlight—could shift sentiment, but so far the response has been muted,” 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said in an emailed note. “Ethereum, meanwhile, is flashing record address activity and surging prices, yet much of the move appears narrative-driven rather than grounded in fundamentals. Both assets are now pressing against key technical boundaries where momentum could either accelerate or stall sharply." Bitcoin and crypto market watchers remain bullish for the rest of 2025, however, some are warning the bitcoin price and crypto market could crash next year. “My view is that once we complete the bull cycle at circa $140,000-$145,000, we will see a corrective bear market in 2026, but I am not looking for a deep correct, but likely a move to $90,000 to $100,000,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, said in emailed comments, adding: “I know this goes against the popular view that we are going to hit the extreme prognosticator’s views of $250,000, $500,000, or even $1 million in 2025 or 2026." Meanwhile, Trump also signed a separate executive order targeting the “debanking” of people and businesses on political grounds, which will “ensure that Federal regulators do not promote policies and practices that allow financial institutions to deny or restrict services based on political beliefs, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, ensuring fair access to banking for all Americans.” The "digital assets industry has also been the target of unfair debanking initiatives," according to a White House fact sheet, with Caitlin Long, the chief executive of crypto-focused Custodia Bank, cheering the addition of the Small Business Administration as an overseer of the federal banking regulators.

For those familiar with the crypto-space, it’s clear that Ethereum (ETH) holds the record as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Better still, it made headlines late 2021 when it reached the ATH of $4,000, making a FOMO to set in as no one, including institutional and retail markets, wanted to be left out. Today, the ETH trades around the $4,000 mark, and many big bag holders are watching keenly as they anticipate the next move regarding Ethereum price projections. They are asking: Where is the next target for ETH? Would such moves affect other Ethereum-based tokens positively or even outperform ETH in the months to come? For instance, one token is attracting increasing attention: Remittix (RTX), an ERC-20 asset designed to address the issue of global money transfers. As Ethereum strengthens its base with spot ETF inflows, gas fee optimizations, and renewed DeFi/NFT activity, some traders believe RTX could emerge as the real breakout payment token in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s a lot of information, but we will flesh it out together shortly. Several major tailwinds have fueled Ethereum’s climb above $4,000: What’s more, different Ethereum price projections are showing that ETH could hit a new ATH if it manages to break through the old ATH and move towards $5,500–$6,000 by Q1 2026, especially should the macro fundamentals agree. However, while ETH remains a huge part of crypto whales’ portfolios, they are also exploring and positioning themselves in other Ethereum-based tokens that could feel the impact of the big ETH bullish move that’s to come. One notable one is Remittix. Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-based token explicitly developed for one use case: cross-border money transfers. The platform bridges crypto and fiat through a remittance model that avoids the costly intermediaries that dominate traditional remittance routes. Here’s why traders are calling it “the future of payments” within the Ethereum ecosystem: Ethereum’s current rally is likely just the beginning. The infrastructure upgrades, ETF exposure, and global DeFi revival position ETH as a long-term winner. But for those aiming to maximize upside potential, assets like Remittix represent a unique opportunity. As the Ethereum price climbs, keep an eye on the tokens it carries with it, and don’t be surprised if RTX becomes one of the most talked-about names before the next altcoin season is over.

Title: Three Revolutions by Simon Hall: Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from an unexpected source

Irish people can be as susceptible as anyone to the charms of a communist dictator. Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera approved a $20,000 loan from Sinn Féin to Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks. Young Bob Geldof distributed 100 copies of Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book around Blackrock College, while President Michael D Higgins paid a warm tribute to Fidel Castro when the “giant among global leaders” died in 2016. As Simon Hall shows in his lively, insightful but disjointed study of how revolutions shaped the 20st century, however, Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from a more unexpected source. Three American journalists played key roles in presenting these tyrants to the West as principled, charismatic and a force for good. Hall frames his episodic narrative around six gruelling journeys that led to either a coup or a scoop. In 1917 Lenin and around 30 other Russian dissidents took a train from Zurich across war-torn Germany to Petrograd’s Finland Station, where his fiery rhetoric inspired the world’s first Soviet republic. That was a cakewalk compared with Mao’s Long March, the 6,000-mile retreat from Chinese nationalist forces in 1934-5 that cost more than 80,000 lives but still established him as the Communist Party’s toughest leader. Castro ended his exile in 1956 by sailing from Mexico to Cuba on what Hall calls “a creaking, leaking leisure yacht”, escaping into the Sierra Maestra mountains and plotting a guerrilla war. The newspaper men profiled here are less familiar, but formidable characters in their own right. John Reed was a bohemian poet who watched Saint Petersburg’s Winter Palace being stormed and penned the Lenin-approved bestseller Ten Days that Shook the World. The goofy, part-Irish Edgar Snow spent three months living among Red Army troops and obediently wrote up Mao’s autobiography. Donnish veteran Herbert Matthews hiked through a dangerous wilderness to secure his star-struck interview with Castro, which caused a sensation when it appeared on the New York Times’s front page. Three Revolutions works best on a storytelling level, full of colourful human details such as Lenin drawing up rules for who could use his carriage toilet. While Hall is clear-eyed about his despotic subjects, however, he goes a little too easy on the newshounds. Journalism may be the first draft of history, but sadly the copy these naive idealists delivered has turned out to need a radical rewrite.

Title: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/harvard-discloses-117m-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-08-09T06:30:01Z

Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a strategic reserve asset, with growing institutional adoption fueling its long-term bullish narrative. The latest major endorsement comes from one of the world’s most prestigious universities — Harvard. In a recent SEC filing, it was revealed that Harvard University’s investment portfolio acquired $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the second quarter of 2025. This move places Harvard among a growing list of influential institutions integrating Bitcoin into their long-term treasury strategies. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, now managing $84 billion in assets under management, has quickly become a dominant vehicle for institutional exposure to BTC. Harvard’s decision highlights a broader shift in capital allocation strategies, where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-conviction growth asset. Institutional participation at this scale not only boosts market credibility but also reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a core asset in diversified portfolios. According to Harvard University’s recent Form 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its $117 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranks as the institution’s fifth-largest investment. This allocation places Bitcoin just ahead of the university’s holdings in major technology giants such as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and NVIDIA. At the end of the reporting period, Harvard held nearly $114 million worth of Alphabet stock, underscoring the significance of its Bitcoin exposure within its broader portfolio. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin over some of the most established names in global technology signals a notable shift in institutional thinking. For decades, elite endowments like Harvard’s have been known for their conservative, long-term investment approach, focusing on assets with proven resilience and growth potential. Including Bitcoin at this level shows that the university views the digital asset as not only a speculative opportunity but also as a strategic reserve holding with long-term value. Harvard’s move reflects a growing consensus among leading institutions that BTC is emerging as a core asset for diversification, inflation protection, and asymmetric upside potential. The fact that Bitcoin now sits alongside — and in some cases above — blue-chip equities in major portfolios highlights its evolution from a niche investment to a mainstream financial instrument. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $116,526, consolidating just below the key resistance zone at $122,077. The 3-day chart shows a sustained bullish structure, with price holding well above the 50-day ($101,725) and 100-day ($96,494) moving averages — both trending upward, signaling strong medium-term momentum. After reclaiming the $115,724 support level, BTC has maintained a steady upward bias, suggesting that bulls are still in control despite recent volatility. The consolidation phase just under resistance indicates market indecision, with buyers accumulating strength for a potential breakout. A decisive close above $122,077 could open the path toward retesting the all-time highs and potentially extending into price discovery. Volume remains relatively stable, but a noticeable uptick on breakout attempts would strengthen the bullish case. On the downside, failure to hold $115,724 could trigger a pullback toward the $110K–$112K range, where additional support and the 50-day moving average converge.

Title: BlackRock rules out XRP and SOL ETFs despite Ripple-SEC case closure

Time Published: 2025-08-09T05:19:29Z

Share this article With Ripple closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, industry analysts anticipate that the resolution will make major fund managers more comfortable offering investment products tied to XRP, Ripple’s native crypto asset. Pro-XRP users, in particular, have been eyeing BlackRock, the asset management giant. But it appears BlackRock has no immediate plans to get on board. A BlackRock spokesperson recently told The Block that spot XRP and Solana (SOL) ETFs are not on the firm’s roadmap for now. The confirmation came shortly after ETF Store President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually enter the XRP ETF market as Ripple and the SEC wrap up their appeals. He said it’s hard to justify ignoring crypto assets apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock really stays away from other crypto ETFs, they’re essentially stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF… I’ll own it if I’m wrong. IMO, makes *zero* sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth. Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold. pic.twitter.com/FtBqMRFpOl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 8, 2025 However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks BlackRock is content with its two existing ETFs, those tied to the two largest crypto assets, and sees diminishing returns in expanding further. I just think they are happy w the two. Law of diminish returns from here on out. But again I’ve nothing to go on but my own spidey sense here. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2025 The analyst is also doubtful that BlackRock will file for an index-based crypto ETF, which potentially includes major assets like XRP, later this year. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, revealed at the Bitcoin 2024 convention that there was ‘very little’ client demand for crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the firm would not launch a Solana ETF in the near term. “We really look at the investor’s ability to see what meets the criteria, what meets the bar to be delivered in an ETF,” Cohen said. “For us right now, both between [investing] ability considerations and also what we hear from our clients… Bitcoin and Ether definitely meet that bar. I think it will be a while before we see anything else.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: A beginner’s guide to orange wine – is it the new rosé?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/drink/2025/08/09/a-beginners-guide-to-orange-wine-is-it-the-new-rose/
Time Published: 2025-08-09T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
Orange wine has been fashionable in wine bars for years and now seems to be taking off elsewhere too. If you are still wondering what it is, think “white wine made like red wine”, as one producer explained it to me. White grapes are crushed and left in contact with the skins, and sometimes pips and stalks too, for a period ranging from hours to days to months. Sometimes called skin contact or amber wine, it was the traditional way to make white wine in many areas before modern technology arrived. It has been made in Georgia and neighbouring Armenia for thousands of years and still is today. More recently it has been revived by winemakers in Slovenia, Friuli and now elsewhere too. In Georgia orange wine is usually macerated, fermented and/or aged in clay amphorae or qvevri, although producers in other countries sometimes use stainless steel or wood. It runs from pale gold to deep brown in colour. Some are a little cloudy, too. Producers are now playing with different hues to create light, fruity summer wines, sometimes called sunset wines because of their pinkish, reddish orange colour. The term can also include rosé and light pale red wines that are served cool. As the juice has been in contact with the skins, orange wines can be lightly tannic, which makes them good with food. They should be served cool or at room temperature rather than chilled as this will highlight the drying tannins in the wine. Provided your fellow wine drinkers like orange wine, it is a great all-purpose party wine that will happily match with all kinds of food, from spicy Indian to grilled red and white meat to salads, pickles and dips. They make nice aperitifs, too: a little bit fruity with a touch of astringency. Fresh and floral with citrus peel, white fruits and a dry, lightly grippy finish. A great introduction to orange wine.

By John Gruber Dekáf Coffee RoastersYou won’t believe it’s decaf. That’s the point.20% off with code: DF A list of various related news items and clips from this, and recent, weeks: Apple Newsroom, on Wednesday — “Apple Increases U.S. Commitment To $600 Billion, Announces American Manufacturing Program”: Apple today announced a new $100 billion commitment to America, a significant acceleration of its U.S. investment that now totals $600 billion over the next four years. Today’s announcement includes the ambitious new American Manufacturing Program (AMP), dedicated to bringing even more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Through AMP, Apple will increase its investment across America and incentivize global companies to manufacture even more critical components in the United States. Separately, also from Apple Newsroom Wednesday — “Apple and Corning Partner to Manufacture 100 Percent of iPhone and Apple Watch Cover Glass in Kentucky”: Apple and Corning today announced a major expansion of their long-standing partnership to make precision glass for Apple products. Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce all of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. This means that 100 percent of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units sold worldwide will be made in the U.S. for the first time. Corning is creating the world’s largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line at the Harrodsburg facility. Corning will now dedicate this entire facility to manufacturing for Apple, which will help increase Corning’s manufacturing and engineering workforce in Kentucky by 50 percent. From inside the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, a 3.5-minute video of Trump’s introductory remarks, then Tim Cook giving Trump a trophy of sorts, with an Apple-logo top made from glass produced at the Corning facility in Kentucky, and a base made from 24-karat gold (perhaps left over from Apple’s decade ago foray into $20,000 “Edition” Apple Watches?). This video is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever witnessed, for everyone involved. (Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.) From the same press event in the Oval Office, a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks. Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and jumped over 5 percent immediately after Wednesday’s announcements. Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades”: In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East, the White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of many U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number of shots at Mr. Cook. During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month after Mr. Cook had lobbied and won an exemption from a 145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the United States. April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour: The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm offensive, according to The New York Times. His goal was to change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a conservative country dependent on oil money where women are treated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants Americans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive investments in growth markets like technology. October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, was brutally assassinated — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since. President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. Per ABC News: President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a “major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the Middle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday. Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was released that concluded that the crown prince approved the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership and friendship. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that, don’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him too much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like you too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia. Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, per CNBC: “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge. So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” [...] But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff exemption, were not immediately clear. There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay. So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”. My take remains somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook have to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.1 But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly illegal and unethical ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power. It’s not even a case of “kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment”. It’s more a case of “kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say supposed because the TACO hypothesis, thus far, has panned out.) Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among other things) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket. I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. Targeted spiteful tariffs, bogus investigations by the Justice Department, personal vilification in MAGA media. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted. Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to accepting as a gift (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar. If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite his long-professed heroes — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole. It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig. But the alternative is more disturbing. What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values. US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That ruthless practicality is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party have already succeeded in corrupting the system. That the corruption isn’t happening, but happened. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice. The White House has long been called the People’s House. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us. Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has. ↩︎ Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2025 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

The Harvard Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the university, has a $116 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, a 13F form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. Not one to be left out, Brown University—which first bought exposure to Bitcoin in May—upped its position in BlackRock's ETF and now holds $13 million worth of shares, a similar filing shows. Neither Brown nor Harvard immediately responded to Decrypt's request for comment. The filings are the latest examples of traditional institutions seeking exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto ETFs like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust—which trades as IBIT—allow investors to buy exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to own and store the digital coin directly. BlackRock’s IBIT is the most successful crypto ETF: The fund has received more cash than any other crypto ETF and currently has $86.3 billion in assets under management. Other major institutions have bought exposure to Bitcoin, once an arcane and obscure asset, since the January 2024 approval of the ETFs. A flood of capital has entered the crypto space since the funds started trading, with investors previously too intimidated by things like storing digital coins in crypto wallets now able to easily buy a position. Pension funds and U.S. states have all bought exposure to Bitcoin via the ETFs over the past year, along with more traditional investments like tech stocks and other U.S. equities.

August 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future” or the “Company”) today announced that it plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “EGM”) on September 19, to seek approval for proposals aimed at supporting the Company’s strategic initiatives and long-term growth. The Company urges all stockholders to vote FOR all proposals. Proposal Highlights： 1. Share Authorization ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 65,225,672, from 167,245,313 to 232,470,985, representing a 39% increase, and increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock, by 5,031,000 shares, from 12,900,000 to 17,931,000, so that the total number of authorized shares, including Common Stock and Preferred Stock, will increase from 180,145,313 shares to 250,401,985 shares. The proposal does not affect the current number of outstanding shares but reflects the Company’s continued adherence to a prudent, disciplined, and relatively low-percentage new share issuance strategy. Having additional authorized shares of Class A Common Stock will help the Company meet its existing obligations including the recent $105 Million financing commitment and be well-positioned to pursue future opportunities, including capital raises, acquisitions, stock dividends or splits, stock issuances under employee benefit plans, and other proper corporate purposes. This increased share capacity is also critical to funding the Company’s ongoing operations and executing its business strategy and facilitate the rapid execution of the Second Chapter of the Bridge Strategy, in alignment with its long-term vision of becoming a leader in the AI-driven EV era and demonstrating the Company’s dedication to putting stockholders first. 2. Private Placement ProposalApproval of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock to holders of certain convertible notes and warrants in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). This measure ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while enabling the Company to honor its obligations to holders of certain of the Company’s convertible notes and common warrants, which is crucial for the Company to obtain funds to support the production of vehicles in the future. 3. Name Change ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Charter to change the Company’s name from “Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.” to “Faraday Future AI Electric Vehicle Inc.” The new name aligns with the Company’s vision to lead the intelligent electric vehicle (EV) industry and highlights its commitment to innovation in AI-driven solutions and smart transportation ecosystems. Additionally, the new name aligns with the Company’s new ticker symbol, FFAI, reinforcing a unified brand identity. 4. Amended 2021 Plan ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan by an additional 9,500,000 shares. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure the Company can continue offering long-term equity incentives as a competitive alternative to cash compensation. This change is critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining top talent, which is essential for executing our business strategy and driving long-term stockholder value. 5. Adjournment Proposal Approval of one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting by the Company from time to time to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if sufficient votes are not represented at the Special Meeting to approve one or more Proposals at the time of such adjournment or if otherwise determined by the chairperson of the Special Meeting to be necessary or appropriate. Recent Key Business Progress with Continued Stockholder Support Powered by ongoing stockholders' backing, our Bridge Strategy has driven comprehensive progress, strengthening both operational and capital fundamentals: "Our Bridge Strategy continues to attract global users, investors, and partners. FF's dual improvements in operational and capital fundamentals are directly attributable to stockholders' long-standing support," YT Jia, Founder and Co-CEO of FF, said. "We're now in the final phase before the year-end rollout of the first FX Super One vehicle in the U.S. market, while simultaneously implementing a major upgrade to our Bridge Strategy that positions FF for accelerated growth. At this critical moment, we've submitted key proposals to advance our business. We urge stockholders to vote FOR all proposals – your decision will determine the company's future!"

Title: AI neo-colonialism: How Big Tech is strip-mining the Global South for data

Time Published: 2025-08-08T19:58:41Z

By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence The new colonial frontier isn’t restricted to mineral-rich Congo or oil-drenched Venezuela. It’s digital, invisible, and everywhere. From the shantytowns of Nairobi to the barrios of Manila, smartphones hum with the raw material of the 21st century: data, all sorts of data. And just like spices and slaves once sailed westward in imperial galleons, metadata now travels quietly to the cloud servers of Palo Alto and Shenzhen. This isn’t development, it is digital extraction. Welcome to the age of AI colonialism. Big Tech firms from the US, and to a lesser extent China, have turned the Global South into a massive open-pit mine for behavioral data. Under the pretense of “AI for Development,” they build infrastructure, donate connectivity, and sponsor pilot programs but the returns flow in only one direction. Voice samples collected in Ghana become training fodder for Western voice assistants. Facial data gathered in Nigerian policing trials end up fine-tuning surveillance software in San Francisco, where western models have had protracted problems in identifying and tracking darker-skinned individuals. Agricultural data scraped from Filipino farmers help power predictive analytics for agribusiness conglomerates that will hardly benefit the Philippines. This is not a partnership. This is colonial pillage dressed in TED Talk lingo. AI is marketed as a miracle equalizer that will help developing nations leapfrog into the future. We were told AI would bring precision agriculture, predictive healthcare, and smart urbanism, among numerous other utopian transformations, to even the most under-resourced regions. These Davos fantasies were regurgitated for nearly two decades. But where is the proof, the showcase project or evidence that even a fraction of those promises was delivered? The only real revolution happening is the outflow of data that were supposed to power these breakthroughs. Big Tech servers abroad now function like the colonial warehouses and banks of yore. Nor are intellectual properties of individuals and SMEs in the Developing World safe from this new brand of predation. Models, patents, ideas, and profits quietly migrate north while the Global South is left with nothing but pilot programs and PowerPoint decks. Worse still, these tools are increasingly used against the very populations providing the raw material, or should I say, raw data. In Kenya, facial recognition technology was introduced as a policing tool under the guise of modernization. In practice, it has disproportionately targeted political activists who, in turn, are also resorting to AI to level the political battlefield. Who ultimately benefits from this internecine clash? Isn’t this the latest incarnation of the old imperial “divide and conquer” dictum? In India, AI-driven fraud detection systems have misclassified thousands of rural poor, unjustly cutting them off from vital government benefits. Imported algorithmic governance – often designed without regard for local context or cultural nuance – compounds the problem. Ironically, while these systems penalize the most vulnerable, India has emerged as a global hub for sophisticated online scams. It is a digital paradox where the poor are relentlessly surveilled, while the real fraudsters flourish with impunity. Nothing exemplifies AI colonialism better than the biometric boom. Tech firms, often in partnership with NGOs or global financial institutions, are racing to digitize identities across the Global South. Fingerprint scans, iris recognition, voiceprint registration have all been justified as ways to “include the unbanked” or “streamline public services.” But these efforts rarely include meaningful consent or data protection frameworks. In many cases, biometric systems have been imposed without community consultation or independent oversight. One of the most egregious examples is Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that offered small payments in exchange for biometric iris scans. Its largest user base? Young people in low-income African nations like Kenya who served as a convenient population to experiment on, far from the regulatory spotlights of Brussels or Washington. (Note; Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT). Once collected, this data becomes part of opaque and often proprietary AI systems whose inner workings are unknowable to the very people they affect. Local regulators are usually outgunned, underfunded or more likely, politically compromised. As a result, entire populations are subjected to surveillance and scoring regimes that they neither understand nor control. The worst culprits in this saga are not Big Tech but local politicians and “technocrats” who sell out their nations at bargain basement prices, couched under the double-speak of “best practices” and UN institutional recommendations. Silicon Valley is the global epicenter of thenew East India Companies. These entities are vested with quasi-sovereign power and backed by vast capital reserves, lobbying muscle, and a veneer of corporate benevolence. Where the original East India Company extracted tea and textiles, today’s digital extractors siphon up location metadata, online behavior, biometric identifiers, and social graph mappings. Consider Meta’s “Free Basics” initiative, which offered zero-rated internet access in dozens of developing countries. What seemed like a humanitarian gesture was, in reality, an attempt to create a captive ecosystem – one where Facebook was the internet. It was banned in India in 2016 but continues in other countries, quietly conditioning the digital habits of hundreds of millions of users. An expanded Meta Connectivity is now used by an estimated 300 million people across many countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Critics warn that these platforms could be exploited for surveillance, IP harvesting, and geopolitical intelligence – often without the knowledge or consent of local populations. No one really knows what is happening. Besides, these services are not entirely free either. Pakistani users of Meta’s tech philanthropy were allegedly charged $1.9 million per month. India, once hailed as a rising digital superpower, now serves as a showpiece for AI neo-colonialism. Its vast IT industry, once brimming with promise, is today little more than an outsourced arm of Western conglomerates. Here is a reality check: how many individuals outside India have even one Indian-made app on their phones? There was a brief window when Indian tech seemed poised to lead. In the late ’90s, a major US tech firm allegedly commissioned two parallel teams – one in Silicon Valley, the other in an Indian city – to build a next-generation operating system to challenge Microsoft. The Indian team delivered. The US team could not. Around the same time, Indian innovators like Sabeer Bhatia gave us Hotmail, which arguably accelerated the decline of the traditional postal system. For a brief moment, the digital future seemed multipolar. That was until Big Capital arrived. Rather than reward innovation, Big Tech consolidated. Rival platforms that didn’t serve the globalist surveillance machine were quietly buried. Competition was replaced with shareholder-sanctioned “coordination,” led by the likes of BlackRock and its predecessors. From that point on, Indian IT firms would be reduced from potential innovators to mere subcontractors. And who better to manage this global digital plantation than a new class of compliant Indian C-Suite executives? These are not the disruptors. They are the taskmasters of digital “kanganis,” running the same extractive labor models once perfected by the East India Company. The dream of an “Asian Century” powered by Indian software and Chinese hardware has curdled into a reality of Chinese software, Chinese hardware, and Chinese AI. Indian tech talent has been reduced to glorified middleware, at best. For all the online chest-thumping about Indian-origin CEOs in the US, where is India’s own Jensen Huang? Where is the Indian-founded equivalent of NVIDIA, OpenAI, or even Palantir? There isn’t one. India produces engineers by the millions but owns almost none of the gilt-edged platforms. It trains the talent, but not the trillion-dollar tech. The colony codes and the empire profits. A similar theme is being played out in the US Ivy League system. But is the tide turning? Nigeria has applied brakes on foreign-backed digital ID programs. Kenya has suspended iris-scanning initiatives after massive backlash. A growing chorus of activists, lawyers, and technologists are calling for data sovereignty: the idea that countries should have the same rights over their data that they claim over oil, water, and land. A few pioneering efforts have emerged. In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law has begun to shape public discourse. In South Africa, local AI research groups are working on open, transparent models rooted in African languages and cultural norms. The African Union has even begun early-stage deliberations on a continental data governance framework. But it is an uphill fight. Western governments, in tandem with corporate lobbyists, continue to push for “data liberalization” which is nothing but a euphemism for open access-mediated exploitation. Aid packages, development grants, and tech investments are increasingly tied to these demands. It echoes the structural adjustment programs of the 1980s, where loans came with strings that hollowed out national control. Only now, the strings are coded in algorithms. The Global South needs a coordinated pushback against Silicon Valley’s digital hegemony. This would involve not just resisting predatory data practices but investment in alternative infrastructures such as sovereign cloud storage, ethical AI standards, community-owned data cooperatives, and open-source platforms. This is how a new digital non-alignment paradigm can be achieved. The Global South has been colonized before. But data, unlike oil or sugar, is invisible, infinitely replicable, and easily stolen. That makes the fight harder but also more urgent. In this new age of algorithmic empires, control over information isn’t just about profit, it is about power, freedom, and the right to define your own future.

Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Allow Crypto into 401(k)

US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order into effect that will allow American 401(ks) to invest in digital assets and related financial instruments. This could be a massive move for the entire digital currency market, as 401(k)s, also known as retirement funds, collectively hold a massive $6.12 trillion in assets and could invest significantly in them. However, the new presidential proclamation isn’t crypto-specific but a massive overhaul of retirement plan options available to American residents. It includes private equity, real estate, and other alternative investments as well. The move has opened the way for asset managers to tap into trillions of dollars worth of potential investments. According to the wording of the executive order: “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”. The document then tasks the Labor Secretary and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement this directive and make it easier for Americans to invest in these disruptive assets. It also asked federal agencies to ensure clarity in the current rules to facilitate the ownership of these assets, but stopped short of asking for specific actions in this regard. Executive orders are one of the primary tools at the disposal of the President’s office in the USA. However, they can be challenged in courts, and the latter have a long precedent of delaying and even striking down orders that don’t line up with the constitution or established precedents. The US pensions market is set to reach a whopping $10 trillion by 2030 with an annual CGR of 9%. The Trump executive order is a major deal for crypto investors in the USA, as previously, federal agencies and executive authority had heavily discouraged crypto in retirement accounts. The move was particularly welcomed by elite asset managers like BlackRock, which was reportedly behind the lobbying of this particular use of presidential power by President Trump. Users on X (formerly Twitter) also chipped in immediately, with one analyst commenting: According to Blackrock’s senior retirement asset manager, Jaime Magyera: “Expanding access to investments long out of reach will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings and address the practical considerations of DC plan fiduciaries,” The move follows years of lobbying by crypto users and asset managers to improve the process of including crypto in 401(ks). It remains to be seen just how much of a major impact it will have on Bitcoin’s price index, which is currently trading around the $117,000 valuation.

With Ethereum surpassing $4,000, prediction platforms see a bullish sentiment, forecasting potential price targets up to $60,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) surged past the $4,000 mark on Aug. 8, hitting its highest level this year after a sustained market rally that saw it gain nearly 50% in the past month. Data from CryptoSlate shows the asset peaked at $4,047 during US trading hours. Notably, the last time ETH traded above $4,000 was in December 2024, when optimism around Donald Trump’s election victory fueled a wave of pro-crypto sentiment in the US. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data reveals the latest rally caught bearish traders off guard. Short positions against ETH suffered losses totaling $134 million in the past 24 hours as prices defied expectations. Ethereum’s breakout comes amid a surge in institutional interest in the digital asset for their treasury reserves. Over the past month, major firms such as SharpLink and BitMine have accumulated significant ETH holdings and announced multi-billion-dollar purchase plans. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, these entities collectively hold over 3 million ETH—about 2.5% of the total supply—valued at more than $12 billion. BitMine leads with 833,100 ETH, worth approximately $5.2 billion. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has expressed a cautious optimism regarding the increasing corporate interest in ETH. While he welcomed the adoption, Buterin cautioned firms against overleveraging their ETH holdings. According to Buterin: “If you woke me up 3 years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that they turned into an overleveraged game.” In addition to these firms, the Ethereum network has also seen a surge in adoption via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a record $5 billion in inflows recorded in July. According to SoSo Value data, the trend has continued into the new month, with the nine funds registering just two days of outflows in August compared to four days of outflows experienced by their Bitcoin counterparts. Additionally, traditional financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Robinhood have expanded their activities around Ethereum, focusing on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Looking ahead, market optimism continues to rise along with expectations of Ethereum’s continued price growth. Crypto bettors on Polymarket, the leading decentralized prediction platform, believe there is a 60% chance that ETH will exceed $5,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 36% of traders believe it could reach $6,000, and 24% predict a rise to $7,000. Notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is more bullish about Ethereum’s price hitting $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, BitMine’s projections suggest a much higher potential, estimating ETH’s implied price at $60,000. At the time of press 8:22 pm UTC on Aug. 8, 2025, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 5.63% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $488.37 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $46.05 billion.

Title: Meta’s $29 Billion Deal Marks Pivotal Moment for Private Credit

(Bloomberg) -- The heavy hitters of private credit have been waiting for this moment for years. Major lenders, which often cater to companies with dented credit, talk endlessly about the opportunities in investment-grade debt and in financing the breakneck growth of artificial intelligence. They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana. That transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge. “Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.” The biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years. For Meta, Pimco is planning to arrange $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. The bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Morgan Stanley advised Meta on the deal but isn’t leading the financing. It is the largest funding package related to a specific AI data center by a mile, with others involving xAI Corp. or Coreweave Inc. well below $10 billion. Microsoft Inc., BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle are teaming up to raise $30 billion of private equity that can be leveraged to $100 billion, with Nvidia Corp. and xAI also joining in, but that money is for a series of data warehouses and energy infrastructure rather than an individual project. The most recent debt deal of any kind that’s even near the size of Meta’s was a $26 billion bond sale to support Mars Inc.’s purchase of rival food-maker Kellanova in March. A group of banks put together the financing, which was funneled through to their typical investors in the syndicated market. Dry Powder Private credit firms have about $450 billion of dry powder to invest, according to Preqin data, and are clamoring for this kind of business. The corporate acquisitions that often fuel private credit deals are practically at a standstill. And these firms aspire to more fully become rivals to traditional Wall Street banks — handling everything from advising companies to structuring their debt to providing some of it themselves. Expanding further into investment-grade deals could help make private credit a $40 trillion market, according to an estimate from Apollo. “This ecosystem of private investment-grade is a massive market with a huge tailwind,” Michael Zawadzki, the global chief investment officer at Blackstone’s credit and insurance unit, said last year. Representatives for Apollo, Meta, Pimco, Blue Owl, Brookfield, Blackstone, Ares and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Those for KKR and xAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. KKR and Energy Capital Partners last year agreed to a $50 billion partnership to accelerate the development of infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz has compared the AI craze to the Gold Rush: though lenders aren’t out there digging for treasure, they can provide the “picks and shovels” that technology firms need. “In this case, it takes the modern version, the data centers,” he said during a conference call on July 31. “And we are the best placed firm to help develop and to help fund those data centers.” --With assistance from Laura Benitez and Kurt Wagner.

Title: Ken Paxton Took Victory Lap Suing Woke ‘Cartel’ He Quietly Invests Fortune In

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:37:26Z

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is taking a victory lap for spearheading a multi-state lawsuit taking on the world’s largest asset managers, but is quietly sitting upon thousands of shares of mutual funds managed by one of the targets of his complaint, according to recent financial disclosures. Paxton cheered a Texas judge’s ruling on Aug. 1 denying a petition from the investment juggernauts — BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the attorney general and ten other Republican states. Though Paxton had then cast Vanguard as part of an “investment cartel” who works to “squeeze more money out of everyday Americans,” his holdings in five Vanguard mutual funds have largely flown under the radar. (RELATED: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’) “I just secured a major win against Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street,” Paxton wrote in an Aug. 1 post to the social media platform X — after a judge green-lit his antitrust lawsuit, arguing the money managers illegally conspired to slash coal production under the guise of a left-wing climate agenda. “These financial corporations created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets, and today’s victory represents an important step in holding them accountable.” Paxton is running to unseat Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn in a primary contest that is shaping up to be one of the most brutal races of the midterms. Though Paxton has taken an early lead in polling, Cornyn — with the backing of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm and several outside spending groups — is mounting a concerted effort to close the gap. President Donald Trump, who said in April that he likes both candidates, has not yet issued an endorsement. The attorney general submitted a personal financial disclosure for his Senate run on June 16 — reporting thousands of shares in six Vanguard mutual funds valued between $1.6 million and $6.25 million. The amounts on financial disclosure forms are reported in ranges making Paxton’s net worth derived from the Vanguard shares difficult to pin down. Cornyn’s backers are criticizing Paxton’s investment holdings in Vanguard funds, noting the attorney general has repeatedly slammed the investment firm for allegedly bleeding Texans’ pocketbooks dry by illegally conspiring to drive up energy prices. “The fact that Paxton profits off the very practices he condemns shows he’s more interested in personal gain over principled leadership,” pro-Cornyn super PAC Texans for a Conservative Majority executive director Aaron Whitehead told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If he truly believes this firm is hurting Texans why is he investing his personal money with them?” WASHINGTON, DC – AUGUST 01: Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) (L) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) speak in the hallway between votes at the U.S. Capitol on August 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) “You can always count on Crooked Ken Paxton to act unethically, dishonestly and selfishly, as he has done here. Texans can’t trust Ken Paxton, something he proves on a daily basis,” Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak told the DCNF. Paxton’s investments in Vanguard, a pioneer of ultra-low cost investing, are a mixed bag of passively managed index funds and actively managed portfolios. He reported holding between 3,100 and 12,495 shares spread across five Vanguard mutual funds, according to a financial statement filed with the Texas Ethics Commission in June for the 2024 calendar year. Paxton has invested between $1 million and $5 million in Vanguard’s Institutional Index Fund (VIIIX), representing the largest investment holding on his Senate financial disclosure form. The low-cost index fund is passively managed by the firm and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, which seeks to mirror the performance of the nation’s largest stocks. The attorney general has also invested between $100,000 and $250,000 in Vanguard’s Primecap Fund (VPMCX), an actively managed “large-growth” fund offered by the firm, which touts outperforming the S&P 500 by an average of 2% annually. An additional Vanguard fund listed on Paxton’s disclosure is held by his wife, Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. She has invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a Vanguard index fund that matches the performance of the overall stock market, according to Paxton’s Senate financial disclosure forms. Angela Paxton filed for divorce in July after 38 years of marriage, citing “biblical grounds.” Spokespersons for Paxton did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment. “I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy,” Paxton said regarding his lawsuit against Vanguard and other asset managers on Aug 1.

Title: XRP gains legal clarity in US after Ripple settles SEC case

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:18:58Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission reached a decisive conclusion this week, triggering a sharp rally in XRP’s price and trading volume. The settlement confirmed that Ripple’s past programmatic and institutional sales of XRP were lawful, removing a major source of uncertainty that had weighed on the token since the lawsuit began. Within hours of the news, XRP surged 5.21% to $3.22, while trading volume climbed 164.43%, signalling renewed confidence from both retail and institutional traders. Analysts say the ruling could reshape market perceptions of XRP and potentially pave the way for future institutional products tied to the asset. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan announced that the legal dispute over Ripple’s previous programmatic and institutional XRP sales has been resolved with the SEC. The clarification confirms that these sales were compliant under US law, establishing that XRP itself is not a security. This development follows years of litigation that placed XRP under intense regulatory scrutiny, with Ripple and its community consistently challenging the SEC’s stance. The resolution has been widely interpreted as a significant turning point for the asset, particularly in the United States market. Analysts note that the combination of legal clarity and increased liquidity could drive more institutional participation in the months ahead. The latest ruling has bolstered expectations that large financial institutions may reconsider their stance on XRP. Some market commentators have even suggested that asset management giant BlackRock could explore an XRP exchange-traded fund, a move that would broaden access to the token for mainstream investors. While no official ETF filing has been made, industry experts believe XRP’s regulatory clarity gives it a competitive advantage over other digital assets still facing classification uncertainty. This could help position XRP as a viable option for both cross-border payment solutions and investment products. The settlement has reignited debates between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. Bitcoin-only advocates have continued to brand altcoins as securities, with MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor repeatedly asserting that only Bitcoin qualifies as a commodity. Morgan pushed back against these claims, highlighting XRP’s performance since its launch, which he calculated as exceeding 50,000% growth. He also responded to recent criticism from Bitcoin maximalists such as Adam Livingston, who alleged that Ripple could use banks to offload XRP onto retail investors. Traders are now monitoring whether XRP can sustain its upward momentum. The recent surge, combined with the removal of legal uncertainty, has given the asset a stronger market position. However, the cryptocurrency landscape remains highly competitive, and community sentiment continues to influence market moves. If institutional interest materialises, analysts expect XRP could see further demand growth, especially if new investment products are introduced. The ruling may also spark fresh regulatory conversations around the status of other digital assets, potentially influencing the broader crypto market.
