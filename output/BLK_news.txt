The cash assassins set their sights on Europe’s biggest economy. If there’s one major European economy that did not get the memo on moving swiftly away from cash to digital payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is Germany. Though cash use has declined in recent years, physical notes and coins are still the main payment method. In 2023, 51% of all transactions were still being made with cash, with debit cards in a distant second place at 27%, according to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s annual payments survey. [1] In the same year, Foreign Policy magazine described Germany as “hopelessly addicted” to cash: Germany is not the only country standing athwart the global trend toward cashless payments. In Austria, cash is so popular that the Austrian chancellor has claimed it should amount to a constitutional right. Yet in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, cash will account for just 6 percent within a decade, and in the Netherlands only 11 percent of transactions were made in cash last year. In other bigger economies, the pace of the decline is even faster. While in China 8 percent of point-of-sale (POS) transactions were made in cash, in India, cash use has declined from 91 percent in 2019 to 27 percent in 2022. But in Germany, an obsession with [NC: as opposed to “concerns about] privacy, mistrust of big-tech and fintech in general [NC: probably warranted], and worries about political and financial crises depleting bank balances overnight—an experience rooted in history as well as a cultural desire for control—all contribute to the country’s love for cash… On average, Germans carry more than 100 euros in their wallets—much more than their counterparts in many other developed nations. Since the euro was introduced, the Bundesbank has issued more cash than any other member in the 27-nation European Union, and according to the Bundesbank report, even though cash use was down from 74 percent in 2017, as high as 69 percent of respondents expressed their intention to continue to pay in cash. Even as Germany has suffered wave after wave of ATM bombings, providing banks with a perfect pretext for closing even more branches and ATMs, and local and federal authorities have made it increasingly difficult to pay in cash for basic services such as public transport or registering a driving license, as the German financial journalist and cash advocate Norbert Häring has documented (in German), most Germans have continued to cling to cash. In a survey conducted by the European Central Bank, 69% of Germans said that cash is either important or very important to them. As Der Spiegel International noted, with a gentle dash of PMC arrogance and derision, in its article last April, “Cash’s Last Stand”, this is particularly true of “older people and people with low incomes and education levels.” Enter the Cash Assassins But the country’s financial institutions, together with payment processors, are now taking matters into their own hands. As Häring reports (in German), big banks are joining forces with large credit card companies in an attempt to force cash out of the market through cartel pricing and unfair competition: The new initiative “Germany pays digitally”… is not an “initiative”, but a cartel. It consists of Commerzbank (Commerz Globalpay), Deutsche Bank, Volks- and Raiffeisenbanken (VR Pay), Mastercard, Visa, Flatpay, Unzer and SumUp. Further cartel members are expressly welcome to join. The aim is to displace their main competitor, cash, and the cash service providers through dumping prices. I can’t judge whether it’s a legal cartel, but it seems legally questionable to me… This is because cash causes costs that are often lower for small merchants than the costs of digital payments, but not zero. Here’s how it will work: the cartel will be offering small merchants and retailers with up to €50,000 in annual turnover free installation of a payment terminal and free use of it for all transactions for up to one year. No fees, no commissions. Those will obviously kick in during the second year. As Häring notes, the cartel members are willing to accept temporary losses in order to incentivise small businesses to accept digital payments instead of cash. The irony is that two of the banks involved in the scheme, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, are also directly involved in Deutsche Bundesbank’s recently established National Cash Forum, whose stated mission is “to preserve cash as a cost-effective and widely used means of payment in Germany.” One would be hard-pushed to find a better example of the fox looking after the chicken coop. As Häring notes, the central bank’s cash forum is clearly a facade intended to give the impression that the central bank and commercial lenders are taking measures to protect cash while doing the exact opposite. As for Visa and Mastercard, it should hardly come as a surprise that they are involved in this cartel-like attack on cash. Both are members of the Better Than Cash Alliance (BTCA), a coalition of governments, financial firms, IT companies and philanthro-capitalist foundations that have been pushing back against cash use worldwide, primarily in the Global South, for over a decade. The state sponsors of BTCA include Germany’s federal government. For payment companies like Mastercard and Visa that generate fees from facilitating money transfers between banks accounts, cash is their ultimate rival. In 2010, the then-CEO of Mastercard (and current president of the World Bank), Ajay Banga, openly declared war on cash: “In today’s terms, only 3% of retail spend in India or in China are through electronic payments. The rest is cash. I have declared war on cash; I believe MasterCard will grow by growing against cash. If you keep looking at 3%, everybody’s a rival; if you look at the remaining 97%, everyone’s a partner. Both Mastercard and Visa have played arguably the biggest role in demonising cash over the past decade or so. As Brett Scott documents in his book Cloud Money, the payments industry has “consistently cast card payments as being safer, cleaner and higher status than cash, thereby slowly associating the latter with crime, disease and low status.” The demonisation campaign hit a whole new level when cash became erroneously associated with COVID-19 infections. In early March 2020, a WHO spokesperson said: “We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses … when possible it’s a good idea to use contactless payments.” The WHO would later walk back its statement, stressing that it was not advising people to abandon the use of cash. But by then media outlets, payment card companies, fintech start-ups and big-box retailers had seized on the original comments and magnified them, sparking fears over the safety of cash. At the same governments and central banks around the world loosened the limits on contactless card payments. For Mastercard this was nothing new. The company has been stoking the global public’s fear of cash as a vector of bacteria and disease since at least March 2013, when it sponsored an Oxford University “trial” into the germ loads found on the banknotes of a selection of global currencies. Mastercard reserved the exclusive right to present the findings of the trial as well as the results of a highly misleading survey on public perceptions of the health risks of cash, which it did in gaudy glory around the world. “A Roaring Success” In most countries in the so-called collective West, the Global War on Cash has been a roaring success. As shown in the map below, by the the second year of the pandemic cash had already been eclipsed in most of the economies of Northern and North-Western Europe. Granted, it was a different story in other parts of the continent, particularly Central and Southern Europe. It is also true that some countries, including the UK, France, and Spain, have seen a moderate recovery in cash use since the lockdowns of 2020-21. Where in Europe is cash still the most common payment method? In Australia I’m never ever using cash and always experience a culture shock when going back to Germany. Source: https://t.co/wcrj4LkPTL pic.twitter.com/7t8M0Is3Ko — Simon Kuestenmacher (@simongerman600) July 2, 2021 The mass abandonment of cash has been driven by a host of factors such as generational shifts and technological advances, including the rise of e-commerce and seamless contactless payments. Payment card companies, banks and big retailers knew from the get-go that contactless payments would not only offer higher transaction speeds and lower cash handling costs but also encourage compulsive consumption. Now, the payment card companies and banks want to move away from cards to biometric payments. But the notion that this is all part of an organic bottom-up process is swiftly debunked by this example of cartel-like behaviour from German banks and global payment processors. The War on Cash continues to escalate, particularly in countries countries where cash is still King, albeit a rather diminished one, such as Germany, Spain and Austria. Unless access to cash and the ability to use it as a means of payment are protected by law, ideally through constitutional amendments, its future is far from guaranteed, especially with the European Central Bank and the European Commission desperate to accelerate the rollout of the Euro Area’s proposed central bank digital currency, the digital euro. So far, to my knowledge (and I invite readers to correct me), only two EU countries have actually taken that step since the pandemic: Spain, which in 2022 passed a reform of the General Law for the Defence of Consumers and Users that ensures that all businesses have the obligation to accept cash as a means of payment [2]; and Slovakia, which in 2023 introduced a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to pay for the purchase of goods and services in cash. In doing so, it earned itself a stiff rebuke from the European Central Bank. “The ECB respectfully suggests that the provision of the constitution is outside of the competence of a member state whose currency is the euro,” said ECB president Christine Lagarde. The governments and central banks of Sweden and Finland, two of Europe’s most cashless economies, have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the dangers of abandoning cash too quickly, even describing their over-dependence on digital banking as a potential threat to national security. As a recent Guardian article notes, “in the context of today, with war in Europe, unpredictability in the US and the fear of Russian hybrid attacks almost a part of daily life in Sweden, life without cash is not proving the utopia that perhaps it once promised to be.” However, neither Finland nor Sweden, as far as I can tell, have taken legislative action to protect access to cash or its use as a means of payment. In Denmark, by contrast, the use of cash is already protected by law. Businesses there must accept notes or coins between 6 am and 10 pm unless the transaction is online or at an unstaffed outlet such as a self-service petrol station. Norway, which is not an EU member, brought in legislation in October last year that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they do not accept cash. The government has also recommended that citizens “keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”. This is one of the many paradoxes of the current situation in Europe: even as the continent’s most cashless economies warn about the risks of going too cashless, especially at a time of intensifying IT outages, escalating cyber attacks and other forms of hybrid war, the cash assassins continue to escalate their War on Cash in other more cash-friendly countries — for their own interests, of course. Meanwhile, the ECB is trying to fast track the digital euro into existence even as other central banks express their reservations. In cash-loving Austria, the central bank has taken an unusual step to protect citizens’ access to cash as banks increasingly shutter branches and remove ATMs. The Oesterreichische Nationalbank has decided to install 120 new ATMs in rural communities that it itself will operate. To avoid banks taking advantage of this move by closing down even more ATMs in remote communities, the Association of Municipalities has negotiated an agreement with the banks in which they commit to refraining from dismantling ATMs by the end of 2029. This example goes to show that if central banks and governments really want to protect cash as a public good, there is a way. But it is one that is unlikely to be adopted by the Deutsche Bundesbank or the incoming Merz government, led as it is by a man with intimate ties with Germany’s banking sector and the US investment manager BlackRock. [1] “Measured in terms of turnover, debit card payments accounted for 32% of total expenditure, placing them firmly in first place, followed in second place by cash (26%),” reported the Bundesbank. Compared with the 2021 study, the share of payments settled in cash sank from 58% to 51%. Contrast this with the UK where card transactions in 2023 represented 61 per cent of all payments in the UK, making up almost 86 per cent of the total value of retail transactions. Also worth noting: as the Visa-Mastercard duopoly has increased its market share in recent years, so too have the processing fees they charge merchants, roughly equating to an added £170 million cost per year for UK businesses. [2] At the same time, Spain has one of the lowest limits on cash payments in the EU (1,000 euros). Not strictly on message but, if I give my postal address code (only) to a retailer during a Debit (Mastercard) card transaction, it is not unusual for me to receive an advert from the retailer into my email inbox shortly thereafter. This would only have been possible if Mastercard had shared my personal data with others. Did I give them permission to? Did they pay me for this ‘service’. No. Is this ‘strictly’ legal? Or arguably not? That’s one of the main benefits of cash – transfer is anonymous. Even the Govenor of the Bank of England (in my case), who ‘guarantees’ my payment on the back of tax receipts, doesn’t know about it (and doesn’t get a fee or commission from it). Perhaps the banks should charge a fee for issuing cash, and make cashless transactions free of charge. Paypal offers Mastercard that gives 3% cashback on purchases. Except when it doesn’t. After noticing my purchases at certain large and powerful retailers like Walmart and Chewy ignore instructions to purchase thru Paypal (and thus PayPal Mastercatd) so I can get the 3% and instead charge my bank account 100% directly (so that Walmart gets the full 100% instead of 97%), I transferred my purchases to Sam’s Club Mastercard which offers different but similar cashback. When I contact PayPal asking why they ignore my payment instructions, they at first denied it happened. But one service rep who knew a bit more then most eventually did mention their serive terms allow then do anything they want (not those exact words). The Point? The discounts being offered in Germany will vanish when the credit cards want them to. Presumably when cash is no longer an option. Cash is how I pay my help. As far as I’m concerned, this is a private transaction and none of the government’s business. I suspect this is a common belief, not shared by the fascist government/bank axis, and the reason they are trying to get rid of cash. Anyway, up theirs. Even if they manage to reduce the supply of cash, silver dollars and gold oz’s have always been and will always be cash. I’m stocking up. Not surprised that Germany and Austria are conservative with money and want to use cash as both countries experienced hyperinflation a century ago and memories can be long. You know what people there should do? Start a Use Cash movement. Tell everybody that when the Russians come, they will hit their power centers like they do in the Ukraine so that all those cards will be useless. Cash is vital to national security then and if the government tries to say anything, tell them that is what the government is telling the people all the time – that the Russkies are coming. And then ask the government if they told the truth there or were they just lying. Hoist them on their own picard. I live in San Diego, CA. I do not do business with anyone who does not take cash. “both countries experienced hyperinflation a century ago and memories can be long.” That idea that Germans have been so traumatized by the hyperinflation of the early 1920s that its memory still informs their economic decisions nowadays is very popular outside Germany, but not prevalent in Germany itself. Other countries that experienced hyperinflation at that time were, as you mention, Austria, but also Poland, Russia, and Hungary — this country being actually the historical champion with a second bout of hyperinflation in 1946, exceeding the much-touted Weimar inflation by… 15 orders of magnitude (Weimar inflation divided the value of money by 1000 billions; the post-WWI one in Russia by 50 billions; the Hungarian inflation of 1946 by 400 billions of billions of billions). Do Russia, Hungary, and Poland also have a (comparatively) much higher propensity to use cash? Do those (truly exceptional) events that affected the great-grandparents (or just their grandparents, as in Hungary) of the current young generations constitute a relevant factor after a century? I strongly doubt it. Yeah I had anecdotes about conferences in Germany going back to mid 1990s so Dad, when doing business there, stocked up on cash beforehand (which he needed). The “protection against hyperinflation or just plain overpaying” was big on my Spanish holidays among Germans. German tourists paid cash a lot more and had much higher tendency to buy food at local supermarkets to cook in their apartments rather than eat out. The occasional Spanish business owner (typically a bar owner), when having had one too many, would complain that UK and Irish customers were best whilst Germans the stingiest. Given the known constraints on the budget in Germany I kinda get this. I strongly suspect underground economies are emerging liking cash…..I have seen this at barbers etc but have no concrete evidence. So colour me curious. Older Austrian here, i provide this observation: The younger generations are more likely to also use non-cash, but not by much. In the capital Vienna about half of the population is either not an Austian citizen, not born in Austria, or the 1st generation descendant of those two groups. The majority of those 50% comes from near/far southeast (Balkans, Middle East, Afghanistan/Chechnia). For some as yet not researched reason that part of the population has a substantially greater affinity to use non-cash than indigenous Austrians. This is very easy to observe at any retailer. So the numbers one reads are quite skewed, and i would assume the situation Germany to be similar, maybe a bit less extreme as the proportion if indigenous germans is a bit higher. Perhaps those near/far southeasterners want to feel like they are being modern and they feel like cashless is a modern way to be modern. One wonders if social scientists could do studies to find out if this is a reason or not. German here. Actually, I read Härings article only yesterday, being a regular at his site. Its interesting to get a broader picture from outside on this topic. A couple of observations: – As to myself, I am using digital means regularly only at fuel stations since I noticed that most of the cash I got went there (I have to do a lot of driving for professional reasons). Rarely, when I run out of cash unexpectedly, for grocery. The convenience aspect of cashless is there, obviously. So it’s more a matter of principle to stick to cash for everything else. The reasons are known: practicability (as in small transactions between neighbours e.g.), anonymity and technical safety. In fact we had a nationwide failure of electronic cash only last summer. Didn’t last long, couple of hours, but I guess this made people aware again of the implications of exclusively cashless payment. btw, the self service fuel station in my village doesn’t like my ec card anymore, so I have to use paper money there now anyway. Part of the deterioration of this country. It would be grotesque to force people to use cashless means under these circumstances. – Lots of people are using their smart phone nowadays for payment. It seems even preferable to cards is my impression. Though, ‘no touch’ is an illusion. And the touch displays or typing pads or pencils one still has to use house worse microbiomes than any coin or paper bill. Employees of the federal and provincial governments try repeatedly to get me to receive my monthly payments from them by direct deposit. But I insist they continue using the postal service to provide me with those payments because I don’t trust them. What I tell them is with direct deposit I am stuck with one particular brand of bank and I want freedom of choice to decide which brand to use which assists me to avoid line ups at any given branch. Besides not telling them I don’t trust them, which I don’t, I also don’t tell them I encourage my clients to provide their payments to me by direct deposit. My tenancy agreement states I am not to run a business out of my residence. It is also none of the government’s business that I have undeclared income from my loan business. All for one, one for all, every man for himself. — The Three Stooges Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

Title: The Six-Figure Nannies and Housekeepers of Palm Beach

Full Content:
This past summer, on a visit to Palm Beach, Florida, I met a nanny named Jovana Capric at a coffee shop at the Breakers, the historic oceanside luxury resort, built in 1926. It was late June, the season when the town’s wealthy residents leave for Nantucket, the Hamptons, or Europe. The used tea sets at the Church Mouse, a local charity shop, had all been picked through; the mansions along Ocean Boulevard were shuttered and dark at night. On the patio, where we sat beneath flower-covered trellises, only a few people lingered, drinking iced coffee in the thick summer air. Capric, who is thirty-three years old, grew up in Port St. Lucie, Florida, about an hour north of Palm Beach. Her career working with children began in high school, while she had a job as a hostess at a Chuck E. Cheese in Boca Raton. “There was someone having his second-birthday party, and the parents just loved how I interacted with their son,” she told me. “And they’re, like, ‘Hey, do you by chance babysit?’ ” The conversation led to a gig as a part-time babysitter for them, and then to work as an assistant teacher at their children’s Montessori school. “Then, when I was a teacher,” she said, “I had families kind of shark me out of working for the school.” The pay was better, fifteen to twenty dollars an hour instead of eleven, so she left, in 2015, to nanny full time for a family with twins and dropped out of Florida Atlantic University, where she had been studying for a degree in psychology. “I could have paid thousands of dollars to get my Montessori certification,” she said, “but for me and in any job that I’ve had, experience trumps anything.” She began deliberately looking to work for more affluent families and found one through a listing on the website care.com. When that contract was up, she said, “I was, like, O.K., I gotta find out how I can find more of these families, and it’s not gonna be through care.com.” Eventually she came across an agency, the Nanny League, that had offices around the country and specialized in placing prospective educated employees with wealthy families. Capric has an associate’s degree, and, to make herself a more attractive candidate, she pursued certifications in subjects such as conscious discipline. “I’m an expert in temper tantrums,” she told me. In 2021, after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Capric, who by then was nannying for a well-to-do family in Houston, returned to South Florida. She was following the money: “These people coming from the Northeast are used to paying a lot.” Palm Beach is an island—known locally as “the Island”—connected to the larger and less posh city of West Palm Beach, on the mainland, by a series of bridges. It was first developed as a winter escape for the wealthy, in the late nineteenth century, by the railroad and Standard Oil magnate Henry Flagler, and quickly became an old-money enclave whose pretentiousness was entwined with antisemitism and racism. (From 1939 until 1986, an ordinance required service workers in Palm Beach to register their fingerprints and carry an identification card, which Garry Trudeau once compared in “Doonesbury” to the pass books of apartheid South Africa.) But Palm Beach and West Palm Beach have seen a transformation since 2020. Financial firms, particularly from the Northeast, have migrated to Florida to form what’s now being referred to as “Wall Street South.” Drawn by the state’s low tax rates, lack of pandemic restrictions, conservative politics, and balmy weather, at least a hundred asset-management firms, according to the Palm Beach Business Development Board’s website, have opened offices in the county since 2020, among them Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge funds such as Ken Griffin’s Citadel, Paul Singer’s Elliott Investment Management, and Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management. Some of the biggest firms share a newly built office building in downtown West Palm Beach, adjacent to a branch of the Wall Street steak house Harry’s. According to one estimate, between 2013 and 2023 two cities in the county, Palm Beach and West Palm Beach, experienced a ninety-three-per-cent increase in the number of millionaire residents, and an estimated sixty-five billionaires now have homes in Palm Beach County. President Trump’s ties to Florida, especially his seventeen-acre oceanfront social club, Mar-a-Lago, have cemented South Florida as a center of financial and political power, and there’s heavy overlap between the list of his boosters and the newcomers to Palm Beach, including Sylvester Stallone, the financier John Paulson, and the technology mogul Larry Ellison. “Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Boca, and Miami—it’s where the big players are,” Capric said. She wore a summery halter dress, and was on a day off from a job she’d had for a year and a half, working as one of two nannies for an affluent family who relocated to Palm Beach in the aftermath of 2020. (Like every household staff member I spoke with, she had signed a nondisclosure agreement, so could not share specific details about her employers.) At the time we met, she was earning a hundred and forty-five thousand dollars a year. She was also getting a housing stipend that covered half her rent, and could expect a year-end bonus. All in all, she told me, her compensation package added up to at least a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year. She has, at times, outearned her husband, who has a master’s degree in engineering. Capric was working as what is called a rotational nanny, doing shifts of two weeks on and two weeks off, swapping with another nanny, although she said that her workload averaged out to about forty hours a week even with the time off. In very wealthy households, “rota nannies” have become the norm, and the family that Capric was with expected full availability when she was on. “This week, I can tell you how much I worked,” she said, looking at an app on her phone that tracks her hours. “Seventy-six hours.” When school is out in the summers, she might work as many as a hundred hours a week. Though the household was fully staffed, with a chef, a personal assistant, and housekeepers, she told me that she has to be prepared for the unforeseen: to do light cleaning if a housekeeper gets sick, to fly to another state on a moment’s notice. “That’s also why I get paid a lot, because my dedication to this family is my life, pretty much,” Capric said. She and her husband do not have children. “There’s no way I could have my own family and do this job.” After we drank our coffees, we did a lap around the beach club at the Breakers, whose initiation fees for membership reportedly skyrocketed after the pandemic, from three hundred thousand dollars to more than five hundred thousand dollars. (The family Capric worked for were members.) It was a Saturday, and there was no indication at the beach club that Palm Beach was in its down season. The children’s pool was especially busy. At the restaurant, pale men in baseball caps and polo shirts lunched with their tanned wives, their kids dressed in matching terry-cloth outfits. Capric surveyed the scene, quietly pointing out families she knew and observing that they are no longer leaving town as soon as school gets out, as Palm Beach has become the place they live and work, instead of a seasonal getaway. Her employers were among those spending more of the summer in town. “This is the longest we’ve been here,” she said. “Normally, we’re here for like two weeks, and then the rest of the summer we’re gone.” In a time of unprecedented wealth disparities, the American economy appears increasingly oriented toward the needs and desires of the richest, perhaps partly because their ranks have grown. A 2024 study by the research firm Altrata found that the number of Americans with a net worth of thirty million dollars or more swelled by thirteen per cent in 2023, to nearly a hundred and forty-eight thousand people. In recent years, income has grown fastest for the top five per cent of earners even as it has stagnated for the rest. But it’s also likely because these earners spend the most. Another study, by Moody’s Analytics, found that, in 2024, almost half of consumer spending in the United States came from the wealthiest ten per cent of households, or those earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year. In cities of concentrated wealth such as Palm Beach, the influence of the richest on the economy takes on almost absurd proportions: on Worth Avenue, there is not only a yacht store but also a store where you can buy antique Japanese naval binoculars for said yacht. What has been called “the new gilded age” has also brought with it a demand for experienced household staff, who, in the face of increased restrictions on immigration, higher professional standards, and a presumption of round-the-clock commitment, are commanding salaries and benefits packages more typical of workers in white-collar professions. When I spoke to representatives at several agencies in South Florida that staff the homes of “ultra-high-net-worth individuals,” as they are known in the industry, the word that I heard most frequently was “discretion.” A nanny, housekeeper, house manager, or personal chef is privy to the intimate lives of their bosses, or “principals,” and these positions’ relatively high compensation comes with an expectation of loyalty. Peter Mahler is the president and founder of Mahler Private Staffing, a firm headquartered in Milwaukee that started serving old-money families of the upper Midwest and now helps place highly trained housekeepers, nannies, butlers, drivers, gardeners, estate managers, and assistants nationwide. The Mahler group also has offices in Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, and, since 2021, Palm Beach. The firm works with around fourteen hundred clients, and maintains a large network of candidates. In exchange for a fee, Mahler Private Staffing, and other agencies like it, will conduct an extensive job search, perform background checks, and help a client put together a compensation offer for a hired candidate in what can be a highly competitive market. They will help a household set up protocols that include cellphone policies, uniform requirements, and which shoes a staff member can wear in the house. When asked, the company will train a new employee on how a client prefers their clothes to be folded and packed before a trip and will sometimes put together a household manual—what British butlers used to call a “drop-dead book”—with detailed information about family allergies, pet routines, or how a client prefers their refrigerator organized. The positions that the firm fills vary widely. A director of estates managing a family’s eight or ten houses might earn three to five hundred thousand dollars a year and oversee dozens of employees and contractors, but even housekeepers, if they possess the right qualifications, can earn more than a hundred thousand dollars a year with benefits, and paid vacation, in certain markets. (By comparison, the median weekly wage of a full-time worker in America adds up to sixty-two thousand dollars a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Mahler, who ran a cleaning service in high school and college and later started a large janitorial company, told me that he learned how to clean from his first client. “She was from the greatest generation of women, who knew that keeping their home was an art form.” He evoked a world of refinement and order, devoid of sweatpants or fast-casual food. As a national provider, Mahler is attuned to where his clients are moving. For the past ten years, Aspen has been one micromarket; Montana has been another; but in recent years few cities in the country have seen as much growth in demand as Palm Beach. He had already been looking to open a Florida office there before the pandemic hit. Afterward, when he resumed the search, he noticed a sudden drop in available commercial real estate. “The competition for space on the island became intense, and that was the first clear indicator that something had changed dramatically,” he said. In the years since, many of the firm’s most significant clients—“people who I would categorize as captains of industry,” he said—have left places like San Francisco, Chicago, and New York to make Palm Beach their primary residence. Several agents observed that the new money in Palm Beach County is notably younger: couples with small children who have fled larger cities to congregate with the like-minded in a pristine place without the irritation of homelessness or, for that matter, encounters with the middle class. With the influx of people, there have been other changes, too: asking rents in Palm Beach County have risen more than fifty per cent for apartments and seventy per cent for single-family homes since May 2019; some private schools now have wait lists. In 2024, the Colony Hotel, a confectionary-pink building off Worth Avenue, paused its customary closure, in late summer—both tourists and locals were still showing up. Once Palm Beach was no longer just a seasonal market, the nature of service there changed, too. “There have always been grand households in Palm Beach that were staffed in the traditional manner with either a majordomo or an estate manager,” Steven Stolman, a fashion designer who owned a chain of eponymous boutiques, including one in Palm Beach, told me. He had lived there for thirty years. Stolman, who now lives part time in California, reminisced about watching the heiress and Broadway producer Terry Allen Kramer serve Thanksgiving stuffing alongside her household staff and wistfully recalled the rules set out in Amy Vanderbilt’s “Complete Book of Etiquette.” “I think that that level of formality is no longer valued or relevant, with the exception of a very few households,” he said. “Now it’s more about fulfilling everyone’s wishes in a very short order.” Wellington, Florida, fifteen miles inland from Palm Beach and home to the National Polo Club, is a mix of sprawling gated communities, golf clubs, and horse farms, and the seasonal gathering place for people who compete in jumping competitions at the Winter Equestrian Festival. “The Bloombergs are here, the Gateses are here,” April Berube, an agent at the Wellington Agency, told me. We met, this past summer, at one of the restaurants of the polo club, where the grounds were closed for the season, and only a couple of people were there, playing tennis on an outside court. The Polo Club is attempting something of a revival, and Berube rhapsodized about the scene the previous winter, when billionaires rubbed shoulders with grooms at the bar, a live band performed at busy brunches, and the fashion label Veronica Beard held a show and luncheon. The club’s director of membership, a former Ford model named Carol Thompson who introduced herself to me as “a grandmother,” came up to say hello. The conversation, as usual, turned to the county’s growth—how bad the traffic is now, how hard it is to get a restaurant reservation even in summer. Thompson said that she had already signed up two hundred and fourteen members to the Polo Club that year. (At thirty-four thousand dollars, its initiation fee is much lower than those of Palm Beach’s Carriage House, the Breakers, or Mar-a-Lago, whose fee Trump hiked in August to a million dollars.) Berube, whose agency placed Capric in her job, had recently been quoted in a CNBC article about the high salaries housekeepers can now earn in Palm Beach. Since then, she said, her agency had been besieged with phone calls from applicants. People have contacted her from Africa, India, and Germany. After one woman was told that she didn’t have the qualifications, her boyfriend came to the office and threatened Berube and her team. The surfeit of interested workers has not alleviated the labor shortage. “We’re begging for housekeepers, but they don’t have the experience, even legals,” Berube told me. On the subject of Trump’s plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, the high-end staffing agencies I spoke with remained comfortably aloof, maintaining that they only work with staff who have authorization to work in the United States. “This can sound however it wants to sound,” Berube said of undocumented people trying to get jobs, “but they’re illegally here, they have no experience, I cannot understand them—and I’m trying to be so nice.” Staffing agencies offer services such as vetting work documentation and conducting background checks. Mahler Private Staffing suggests that the clients perform a second background check for added peace of mind. Berube’s staff have become experts in spotting made-up references. They look at social-media feeds. In job interviews, Lisa Miller, senior search executive with Mahler Private Staffing, will test candidates. “One of the joys of what I do is getting them not to be discreet,” Miller said, of the interviewing process. “I ask them questions and see if they share too much.” The agencies know what kind of demeanor their clients are looking for. I spoke with a former butler, Tim Edwards, who worked as a house manager to a well-known socialite in Palm Beach for sixteen years and now owns a staffing and catering business. He told me that he has recruited cater-waiters from the gym, because they have the right look: clean-cut and presentable. Very few of them make the leap to private service. “It has to be one of those people that wants to be in the back row, not the front row,” he said. It also has to be someone who is not easily provoked by a grumpy boss. “All these private homes are basically businesses,” he said. “It’s a business, but the bosses are humans, too, and if they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and you’re serving them coffee, you’re the first one to be the punching bag.” The ideal candidates need to be tech-savvy. (Luxury homes and appliances have become so high-tech that some families even hire a personal I.T. engineer to maintain their wireless networks and cybersecurity, or a director of home technology to monitor smart systems for climate, lighting, and appliances.) Potential candidates have to know not to open the door for the wrong person or post indiscreetly on social media. They must be cheery, but remain unbothered if relegated to the background. “Who wants to hire someone who is low energy or who walks into a household and is negative?” Berube asked. “There’s a lot of people out there like that, but my clients do not want that.” Housekeepers are expected to have specialized skills in caring for fine art, china, rugs, and designer clothes. Chauffeurs might seek out education at the Rolls-Royce White Glove Chauffeur Training Program, where they are taught to brake gently with a technique called a “champagne stop.” All prospective employees need to be hyperaware of their appearance. Berube told me about a private chef she had positioned who needed to be replaced because the family complained that he was sweating too much. Many candidates benefit from not having families of their own, or from having grown children. “One of the reasons I did so well is I was not married and had no kids,” Edwards told me. “If your child is sick and needs to go to a hospital, that’s another choice to be made.” But household staff also see their commitment returned in kind—I spoke with a housekeeper named Claudia Guzman who had left her car behind to help the family she worked with evacuate their home during flooding in Miami Beach last year. The car was ruined by water damage, but, she said, her employers offered to cover whatever insurance didn’t. In Palm Beach, where Mar-a-Lago forms the beating heart of MAGA society life, staff are expected to be either apolitical or allied with their bosses. Donald Trump’s own valet and body man, Walt Nauta, began serving Diet Cokes in the Oval Office as a Navy petty officer during Trump’s first term and was hired by the President for private service after leaving the military, amid rumors of “fraternization.” (When asked last year about this accusation by the Daily Beast, Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung described it as “a blatant attempt to smear Nauta for political purposes.”) Nauta, a co-defendant in the Justice Department case that charged Trump with the mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, was recently rewarded for his loyalty with an appointment to the board of the United States Naval Academy (the charges were dropped in February after the Department of Justice requested the case be dismissed). “In the nineties, when I started out,” Berube told me, “the big thing was religion.” Now, she said, the agency checks social-media feeds for politically polarizing material. “We’ve got politicians, we have ex-Presidents, we have judges, and they’re asking us these questions.” Although a college degree can help land particular jobs, in many listings higher education is secondary to experience and disposition, including what one Mahler Private Staffing listing called “the Martha factor,” which it defined as “a passion for creating a beautiful, functional, and welcoming home while delivering exceptional service.” Candidates who possess those qualities have found themselves with an increasing amount of negotiating power. I recently spoke with an experienced nanny named Isabel in the middle of a national job hunt. (She asked that I not use her last name.) She is single and childless, and has not dated or had a relationship since finishing her college degree, in interdisciplinary studies with a minor early-childhood education, in 2013. As a “no-screen” nanny, she devotes significant emotional resources to the children in her care—in return, she expects paid vacation, health insurance, and at least a hundred and forty thousand dollars in salary a year. Many high-net-worth families move between multiple homes, and she estimates that at times she has been overseas for eighty per cent of the year, including most holidays, but for her the travel is part of the appeal. “I’ve been to places that I would have never gone on my own or that I never knew existed,” she said. She told me that clients in New York or Boston still seem to offer the highest pay, though Floridians expect the same level of discretion and experience. In South Florida, she continued, “there are some jobs that only pay eighty to one hundred—that’s something I would never take.” Everyone wants to work with a nanny who will teach their children to be in well-mannered conversation with adults instead of glued to an iPad. “The parents want to have the top staff, so they hire the top nannies,” she said. “They’ve been in élite people’s homes, they don’t get starstruck if they see a professional athlete or someone that’s in the White House.” The scrutiny can go both ways. “Working with affluent families can be really tricky,” Capric said. “You, as a professional, have been formally trained on how to communicate with kids, in the sense of learning emotional-regulation strategies.” Some parents, she suggested, don’t have those strategies to teach. “Years ago, my clients used to think they had the upper hand,” Berube told me. Now, she said, an experienced housekeeper might talk to a lawyer before signing a contract. Benefits and paid vacation have become a standard part of an offer. Counter-offers from a candidate’s current employer have become so common that Berube, in advance of putting a candidate on the market, has started checking in with families to make sure that they don’t want to give their housekeeper a raise. The day after meeting with Berube, I visited a housekeeper from Los Angeles named Sandra Bernal, whom Berube had recently placed in a job in Wellington. I met her at her new rental apartment, in Boynton Beach. She had moved in earlier that day and was still waiting for furniture she had ordered to arrive, but the apartment was spotless, with a flat-screen television already hung on the wall. Bernal greeted me in a patterned maxidress, a little white cat nearby. This was Bernal’s second go at life in Palm Beach County. Two years earlier, her employer had sold his house in Brentwood, California, and relocated to Wellington. Bernal had stuck it out for a year, but the job ended up being fewer hours than she wanted and she missed L.A., where she has three adult daughters. When she went back, however, reality set in: the high gas prices, the traffic. She shared an apartment in Redondo Beach with one of her daughters. She got a job in Beverly Hills, a thirty-five-minute drive on paper, but in reality a two-hour commute one way. “I said, No, this is not for me anymore,” she told me. With Berube’s help, it took her only a month to find a new job in Florida. She was glad that she had made the move. Her current two-bedroom apartment is twenty-one hundred dollars a month; in L.A., she said, a place the same size on the West Side would easily cost five thousand dollars a month. Taxes are lower, and except for midsummer she likes the weather. It’s also only a short flight to her native country, El Salvador, which she left for L.A. at fourteen. When she started working as a nanny and housekeeper, in 1989, she was paid in cash, “and it was two hundred dollars a week.” She had always taken pride in the work, and enjoyed it. She had not expected to one day be able to pay her bills by herself. “I’m hoping that this can be my forever job,” she told me of the new position. Later, I spoke with a veteran nanny who had recently retired after a career of more than twenty-five years, many of them in Palm Beach.“I never thought that Florida would pay these salaries,” she said. With her retirement savings, she had bought a home in her native Mexico, and now took on part-time gigs as a newborn specialist. Being a career nanny, she said, had its drawbacks: “All the jets, all the fun, but it’s living someone else’s life, not your own.” Still, she had loved it. “In twenty-six years I worked with more than fifty children. I really put my life out there to take care of children,” she said. “I’m really happy with what I chose.” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated the population addressed by the Altrata study.

Title: It’s a Powerful Force in American Politics. Your 401(k) Depends On It. It’s Complete Nonsense.

Full Content:
This is part of Trump’s Great American Crypto Scam, a series about the catastrophic collision between the second Trump administration and the wild world of cryptocurrency. Read it all here. If you are a person who reads the news, you are a crypto news consumer, because in this new American moment, the people heading the crypto industry are very powerful and never stop talking. More than that, if you are an index fund investor tracking the whole U.S. stock market, you are now a crypto investor, by way of your fractional holdings of companies that have made crypto essential to their businesses. These things were true long before Donald Trump returned for a second term, put crypto buddies in government posts, and issued a flurry of executive directives for which the crypto industry had long been frothing at the mouth. If you don’t care about crypto and have been trying to ignore it, I’ve got bad news: It’s time to pay attention. If you are like me, you may find all of this utterly impossible. I had no trouble comprehending that some people on the internet had developed a coin inspired by a picture of a Shiba Inu, or that it came to be called Doge, or that Dogecoin1 got popular enough to reach a nominal market capitalization of more than $70 billion. (Now it’s worth a mere $40 billion or so.) It is harder to comprehend that there is now a governmental entity called DOGE2, and that it got its acronym because the richest man in the world still has said token on his mind four years after it first took off. I can grasp that there are unelected racist teenagers looting my government, but not that they are flying under the banner of a shit coin that broke containment. How can something so unserious be so mission-critical to living here in 2025? Just by existing in America’s political and financial systems, we and crypto have taken a substantial interest in each other. Our best hope of surviving the deluge is to master the art of separating the serious crypto things from the unserious ones. Lord knows we’ll have time to practice. Less than 1 in 5 Americans has ever directly owned crypto, let alone used it to buy something. In fact, the rate of crypto users among us has barely budged in three years. The predictions of crypto’s true believers—that it would become a common medium for people to buy and sell things, one that could rival fiat currency—remain fantasy. It feels surreal to type out those facts, though, because crypto’s failure to break through as a payment form has not stopped it from becoming culturally inescapable. Crypto backers seem to have a pathological inability not only to stop talking but to stay off the rest of our screens and airwaves. Crypto interests accounted for nearly half of the corporate money spent on the 2024 federal elections, according to progressive think tank Public Citizen. Only the defending champion, fossil fuels, outflanks crypto in rich people’s spending to influence politics. “It’s like the corporate money Death Star,” one of the researchers behind that report told Slate last fall. Bitcoin3 just passed $100,000 for the first time. This is a bit weird, given that Bitcoin does not represent a share of the future cash flow of anything and has no underlying value aside from our collective confidence that someone else will be there to buy it from us. I find this a bit surreal, but it’s been four years since GameStop, and meme stocks are still chugging along as a class, aided by deepening internet delusion. I wouldn’t put my name on a prediction that all crypto holdings will one day crash. Donald and Melania Trump each launched their own crypto tokens in January, which will serve as useful bribery mechanisms for those who’d like to declare financial fealty to the new president and lift the paper value of his holdings at the same time. Anyone who would like to boost the Trumps’ net worth for the sake of it is welcome to do so. But that’s not everyone who bought $TRUMP. Sophisticated traders made a lot of money in a mad dash to own the coin—more on that in a minute—but plenty of traders were out of their depth and lost their shirts. How many are die-hard Trump supporters? We may never know. Meanwhile, the Trump family made something on the order of $100 million in trading fees alone, according to reporting and analysis by crypto experts and a review by the New York Times. Call it what it is: The president and his family are using regular people as a piggy bank, without any of the altruistic pretense required when Trump or his campaign asks them directly for money. Plenty of market actors will enthusiastically make that deal, and plenty cannot possibly afford it. Many crypto industry types thought Trump’s meme coin4 was a betrayal. How dare he take a speculative currency backed by nothing other than other people’s continuing to buy it, then use it to enrich himself? Our president is neither the first nor last person to make this move. (He didn’t even beat “Hawk Tuah” Girl.) But our nation’s anti-corruption laws, not that they’ve had much sway of late, were never meant to contemplate the most powerful person in the country establishing a crypto token in his name. In January, Trump’s meme coin launch caused some of the most severe crypto whiplash that the American public—and certainly its major news outlets—has ever experienced. Trump and his partners created a billion coins, with 800 million of them in the possession of Trump’s own companies. The price of the coin popped, with some people buying it on Jan. 19 for more than $70. Trump, owning 800 million of those coins, found himself minted a “crypto billionaire” in the pages of Axios. Seventy dollars multiplied by 800 million coins is indeed $56 billion. Trump’s net worth, the outlet reported, had increased several times over. That assessment was technically accurate but fundamentally unsound. $TRUMP was a popular token5 that day, with about $20 billion worth of it changing hands. But 80 percent of the coin was never available to the general public, and it was certain that trading would slow down after the first day or two. There was no reason to believe that Trump’s “$56 billion” stake was liquid. If his companies were to actually off-load hundreds of millions of coins in a classic pulling of the rug on his biggest fans, those coins would have sold for much, much less than $56 billion. A version of this problem exists with all large holdings of any investment, because selling big amounts pushes the price down. But the dynamic is more extreme when the asset at hand just does not trade that frequently. Trump’s holdings in the coin are now nominally worth more like $3 billion, as the price of one $TRUMP has dropped below $15. This inadequate presentation of crypto value is a common theme, as the crypto journalist Molly White has detailed. Some coins that barely trade at all have nominal values of many millions of dollars, because establishing a market capitalization for a niche piece of crypto, hoping that it’ll go to the moon, is hilariously easy. For example, Slate could create 1 million SlateCoins, and I, a Slate contributor, could buy one for $10. Slate’s holding of SlateCoins would suddenly have a market capitalization of $10 million—a tremendous but totally fake windfall for our organization. I am exaggerating about how easy it would be, but only a little bit. The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX stemmed from a calculation quite like this made-up one. You will get enough whiplash from learning that all the Bitcoin in the world is now worth almost $2 trillion, a figure that is more or less accurate, because lots of people are always (for now, anyway) happy to buy Bitcoin. No need to add to your bewilderment by paying too much attention to fugazis. There is a company that has long gone by the name MicroStrategy. It opened up shop in 1989, and its Wikipedia page still notes that it is “an American development company that provides business intelligence (BI), mobile software, and cloud-based services.” None of that is why anyone talks about MicroStrategy now, though. In 2020 the business decided to start buying a big pile of Bitcoins. It has spent about $29 billion on Bitcoin, and its big ol’ Bitcoin pile is currently worth about $45 billion. It isn’t quite right to say that buying Bitcoin is the only thing MicroStrategy does these days—its software business turned an $82 million profit in the third quarter of 2024—but I don’t think most people really care about MicroStrategy’s software business. That venture shows up only when you scroll way down the page on the company’s earnings reports. MicroStrategy owns Bitcoin now. That is what it does. And for owning $45 billion of Bitcoin, the company has a market capitalization of about $90 billion. It helps to be good at marketing and have a charismatic CEO named Michael Saylor who can get people so excited about crypto that they’ll pay roughly twice the value of a company’s crypto holdings (which are pretty much all its holdings) to own the company’s stock. Maybe you do not have the appetite to buy the stock of a company whose business plan is “We buy Bitcoin.” But you may very well own that stock anyway. MicroStrategy is now 0.1 percent of Vanguard’s big exchange-traded fund that tracks the total stock market. Coinbase and Robinhood Markets, two companies whose businesses hinge on the trading of crypto, are another 0.14 percent. BlackRock, the asset manager that offers a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin in stock form, is 0.24 percent. These are not huge numbers, but you can take your own guess about whether they will go up or down. You did not plan to stake your 401(k) on artificial intelligence, but now Nvidia alone is more than 5 percent of your portfolio if you own only funds that track the market. Your retirement will have something to do with the performance of crypto even if you own all the nation’s big companies, not crypto. Oh. MicroStrategy just changed its name to Strategy and made its logo look like the Bitcoin logo. The defining value proposition for crypto as a serious currency, from its early days, was that nobody was in charge. It was a truly decentral medium, one beyond the reach of bad actors, be they meddling regulators, authoritarian governments, or an abusive spouse who controls the family bank account. For a while, this was a reasonable point. People had highly personal solutions to hold their Bitcoin. Some kept them in cold storage, on computers or drives disconnected from the internet. Some printed out private keys to access their Bitcoin and stored the paper somewhere safe. (Risky! Don’t lose that paper!) Crypto went from person to person on a blockchain6 rather than through the banking system, and there was nothing resembling a central repository for regular people to put all their Bitcoin. “It’s decentralized, so there’s no country or company that controls it,” Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase and the industry’s most aggressive spokesperson for crypto, told the Hoover Institution in 2024. “It’s a little bit like gold in that sense. There’s no central authority.” Not exactly. Blockchains are inherently decentralized, but the way regular people use crypto is now extremely centralized. They keep it on exchanges like Coinbase7, which has myriad powers over its users and their crypto. Coinbase decides which tokens are listed for sale on its platform, playing a bit of God over which ones get public exposure. Coinbase lives by the same money-laundering and know-your-customer laws that an actual bank does. Coinbase is the custodian of its customers’ holdings, giving it the ability to freeze funds when it believes it has a legal reason (or, in theory, whenever). Crypto purists have argued these points for years. “Not your keys, not your coins,” they like to say. But these people have lost the war. The functional user experience of crypto is now as centralized as anything in finance. And if you don’t like or trust major crypto exchanges but still want to hold some Bitcoin, good news! You can effectively buy it via an exchange-traded fund offered by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $11 trillion under management. You can entertain crypto as part of the world financial system, or you can maintain the pretense that crypto is the countercultural beacon of freedom that its earliest boosters claimed it would be. You cannot do both, but you may be able to buy a lot of TV commercials for a politician who will help you keep up the act. This work is made possible by Slate Plus.

Title: Is Solana Preparing For Rally To $180? SOL’s Social Sentiment Hits Historic Positive Levels

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a key support level amid the recent market recovery, with bullish sentiment seemingly returning to the Altcoin. Some analysts suggested that its momentum could propel the cryptocurrency to the next crucial resistance. Over the past few days, Solana has seen a bullish recovery from last week’s lows, surging 14% from the $121 support. The market’s recovery has propelled the token above the $145 barrier earlier this week, after printing five consecutive green daily candles. Amid this week’s surge, on-chain analytics platform Santiment highlighted that Solana’s social sentiment has seen a massive surge to historic highs fueled by institutional interest, technological advantages, community support, and influencer engagement. “With news of institutions like GameStop and BlackRock are integrating Bitcoin and launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, crypto’s #5 market cap asset is seeing an astounding level of bullish sentiment pouring in on social media,” explained Santiment’s Director of Marketing, Brian Quinlivan. Per the post, social media posts reflect optimism for SOL’s price recovery and a bullish outlook on the broader crypto market. Notably, Solana registers a “nearly unheard of positive vs. negative commentary ratio of 18:1 right now.” Just a month ago, the SOL’s sentiment hit its lowest level in a year. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the sentiment has not been at those levels since Solana reclaimed the $100 barrier in early 2024. It’s worth noting that market sentiment significantly shifted following the collapse of the memecoin frenzy, which fueled SOL’s rally throughout last year. After the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoin launches and the LIBRA token controversy, several community members expressed increasing fatigue from the numerous scams. Subsequently, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped over 50% from its January all-time high (ATH), losing the $200 support zone and hitting a yearly low of $111 earlier this month. Various market watchers noted Solana’s recent performance, underscoring the reclaim of the $136 level on Monday. This level has been a significant resistance for the past two weeks and has also served as a key breakout level during the Q1 and Q4 2024 breakouts. Analyst Jelle considers there’s “a lot of ground to cover” despite the “solid reclaim” of the 2024 range lows. Meanwhile, another market watcher pointed out that Solana broke out an ascending triangle pattern after the price surge. After attempting to reclaim the $140 mark this morning, SOL is currently retesting the recently recovered support, hovering between the $136-$139 price range. A successful breakout confirmation could impulse Solana’s rally toward the next big barrier, at $180. According to Ether Wizz, SOL is “fully ready for its next B I G move.” Once the next crucial resistance is broken, the “next leg up will take us towards $270. Many people are still not ready for this move,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $138, a 2% surge in the weekly timeframe.

Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Exchange Square, which houses the offices of Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The ownership of two key ports along the Panama Canal has become a major flashpoint between the United States and China. At the heart of the showdown is the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings and its subsidiary, Hutchison Ports. Controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison owns two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the canal is “operated by China” and called for the United States to “take back” control. He has even reportedly ordered the U.S. military to explore options to secure “unfettered” access to the canal. To “de-risk” from the geopolitical contention, CK Hutchison reached a $19 billion deal to sell its expansive overseas port businesses to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock in early March. While this deal might make commercial sense for the company, Beijing is reluctant to cede ownership of these ports due to their strategic value and may intervene to stop the deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was enraged that CK Hutchison didn’t seek Beijing’s approval in advance, and Bloomberg has reported that Chinese regulatory agencies have been instructed to scrutinize the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. State-run Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, commonly regarded as a Beijing mouthpiece, published a series of articles accusing the company of being “profit-seeking and unrighteous,” warning that “dancing with” U.S. politicians would lead to “the condemnation of history.” China’s government amplified that messaging when the Chinese Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted the articles on its own website. This backlash reflects Beijing’s increasingly uneasy relationship with Hong Kong’s business elites. Despite the waves of securitization in recent years, the Chinese party-state still lacks formal channels of influence vis-a-vis Hong Kong businesses, and the port sale has only deepened the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s suspicion toward Hong Kong’s capitalist class. While Beijing has long co-opted local businesses to govern Hong Kong – a strategy pioneered by the British colonial government – it has become increasingly distrustful of their autonomy, profit-driven motives, and lack of patriotism. Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to direct Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Is CK Hutchison part of “China, Inc.”? Due to Hong Kong’s weakening autonomy, some Western commentators increasingly view the city as indistinguishable from China. However, enterprises based in Hong Kong and mainland China still fundamentally differ in their susceptibility to Beijing’s influence. Thus, while a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings has operated the ports in Balboa and Cristóbal since 1997, Trump’s claim that China controls the Panama Canal is misleading. Unlike typical participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative or other overseas infrastructure projects, CK Hutchison is not a state-owned enterprise (SOE). It is a private company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its institutional makeup is international. Next to the Li Ka-shing family’s 30 percent share, U.S.-based BlackRock (5 percent), the Vanguard group (2.78 percent), and the Norges Bank Investment Management (1.18 percent) are among its main institutional shareholders. Additionally, its board of directors has a notably international profile, with most members having backgrounds in Anglophone countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Operating by standard international corporate practices, CK Hutchison is more transparent and commercially driven than state-run firms that own or operate the other ports in China’s network. The company’s success story reflects a “Hong Kong” – rather than Chinese – ethos, mirroring the city’s rise as an international business hub during the colonial era. Before Li Ka-shing purchased a controlling interest in 1979, Hutchison was one of the oldest and most prominent British-owned merchant houses operating in the colony, specializing in export trade, dockyards, and shipping. Under Li’s leadership, Hutchison expanded its international footprint, becoming the world’s largest independent port operator, acquiring Husky Oil in Canada, and establishing mobile phone operations in Australia, Europe, and the United States. This trajectory contrasts with that of mainland China-based companies and SOEs, whose success is often tied to close cooperation with the CCP leadership and access to state support. CK Hutchison’s position as a Hong Kong-based company insulates it from the established toolkit used by the Chinese party-state to discipline Chinese companies. For instance, the CCP influences Chinese businesses and SOEs through the party committees embedded in each firm. Under Xi Jinping, the role of party committees has been strengthened and institutionalized, with Xi calling for the integration of party leadership in “all aspects of corporate governance.” The party committee chairman now also chairs the board of directors of SOEs, allowing the CCP to take over many aspects of the board’s functions in corporate governance. Importantly, these changes have been implemented not only in wholly or partially state-owned firms, but also in the private sector. These mechanisms allow the CCP to intervene in Chinese enterprises’ decision-making, ensuring that these enterprises align with the party’s political objectives. CK Hutchison’s governance structure does not have a party committee. As a result, Beijing lacks any direct institutional channels to influence CK Hutchison’s decision-making. While Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the chairman of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, has developed ties with the CCP through his position on the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP’s influence over the company remains weakly institutionalized. Recent reports that China’s highest leadership has summoned Victor Li to discuss the port deal underscore the informal nature of Beijing’s pressure. Hong Kong’s de jure autonomy further complicates Beijing’s ability to pressure CK Hutchison. When China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, it promised to let the city operate with “a high degree of autonomy” and maintain its independent judicial system, meaning that Chinese national security laws do not automatically apply. Until recently, the party-state had preferred indirect means to influence Hong Kong politics, including through ad hoc legal interpretations of the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), political influence via proxies like the Central Government Liaison Office, and the cultivation of strategic partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. Following mass protests in 2019, Beijing institutionalized its control over Hong Kong and localized its national security policies within the Hong Kong legal system by introducing legislation such as the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) and Article 23 of the Basic Law in 2024. Still, these new legal instruments are primarily aimed at dismantling Hong Kong’s civil society and political opposition rather than disciplining businesses. The government has repeatedly assured the private sector they can conduct business as usual. Among the NSL cases brought against companies, pro-democracy media outlets and organizations with significant links with prominent activists were the main targets. As Mark L. Clifford, a former board member of a media company targeted by the NSL, remarked, “It’s one thing to go after Jimmy Lai and Apple Daily, but quite another to go after ‘Superman’ KS Li and his companies, the most successful international business H.K. has ever produced.” The Challenge of Disciplining Hong Kong Capitalists Beijing’s calculus in attempting to induce or coerce CK Hutchison to collaborate with its national security agenda involves two countervailing logics. On the one hand, Beijing and Hong Kong leaders want to avoid a heavy-handed approach to restore confidence in the city’s business environment and woo foreign investment and talent. They want to convince the world that businesses will not be coerced into forgoing commercial interests in favor of national security, especially after the passage of the NSL and Article 23. The Hong Kong government has vigorously campaigned to rehabilitate Hong Kong’s image after its brutal crackdown on civil society and to dispel suggestions that Beijing controls the city. While the NSL’s prohibitions against “collusion with foreign forces” could in theory apply to CK Hutchison, pursuing such charges against a major Hong Kong conglomerate would be unprecedented and highly destabilizing. A potential intervention by Chinese regulatory agencies – along the lines suggested by Bloomberg – would further undermine Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and business confidence, as China does not have formal regulatory authorities over this “purely commercial” deal. The desire to portray Hong Kong as “open for business” explains why Chief Executive John Lee equivocated when asked whether the NSL would apply to the port sale. The fact that China’s central propaganda outlets and government offices have avoided directly condemning the deal – relying instead on fanning public opinion on social media – suggests Xi Jinping is still weighing his options. On the other hand, Beijing does not feel confident entrusting crucial maritime assets to a private Hong Kong company. Since assuming power in 2012, Xi has repeatedly expressed his ambition to “construct a strong sea power,” viewing this as vital to realizing his wider “China dream” of national rejuvenation. This entails not only the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army Navy but also heavy investments in China’s maritime industry. The U.S. Trade Representative recently accused Beijing of seeking to cultivate global trade dependence on China through strategic investments in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While the Chinese government has used SOEs and other proxies in these strategically significant industries to push its maritime strategy, CK Hutchison’s overseas port operation remains a notable exception to the “China, Inc.” approach. According to data collected by MERICS, among the 78 ports with Chinese or Hong Kong ownership or operations, Hutchison operates terminals in 33, outnumbering even China’s SOEs – 26 terminals are operated by China Merchants Group, 19 by COSCO, and 19 by others. The Chinese leadership is rethinking allowing a private Hong Kong company to control such a critical component of its maritime strategy, as well as its broader partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. To stabilize China’s indirect rule in Hong Kong and secure Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub, Beijing has long relied on a ruling coalition formed with local elites, including the business sector. For instance, before the reform of the “patriots only” electoral system in 2021, the functional constituencies (FCs) – elected by members of corporations or registered professional bodies – had constituted half of the seats within Hong Kong’s legislative body. The FCs have served as a reliable counterbalance against democrats in the directly elected geographical constituencies by opposing any attempt to democratize Hong Kong, which they saw as a potential threat to their business interests. However, decades of partnership between Beijing and Hong Kong’s local business elite belie a degree of mutual distrust and suspicion. The Hong Kong capitalists are interested in maintaining close ties with Beijing to exploit economic opportunities in China, but some of them are also wary of China’s more assertive and interventionist approach to the economy. Beijing has been suspicious of Hong Kong businesspeople’s profit-driven motives and “lack of patriotism” as potential obstacles to its political agenda in Hong Kong. The rift between Beijing and Hong Kong business elites became visible in the 2010s. The chief executive election in 2012 was an early indication: within the Election Committee, local tycoons – including Li Ka-shing – backed Henry Tang Ying-yen, the son of a Hong Kong industrialist originating from Shanghai, while Beijing favored Leung Chun-ying, a long-time Beijing loyalist, at the last minute and got him elected. Li in particular has drawn Beijing’s suspicion for “unpatriotic” business decisions and speeches before. Since 2013, Li has gradually moved his assets out of Hong Kong and China, including relocating his flagship company from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands and selling a major commercial complex in Shanghai in 2016. A state-affiliated Chinese think tank viewed his divestment as a betrayal, accusing him of being “ungrateful” for state support in building Hutchison’s real estate business in China and abandoning the country at the first sign of economic trouble in the 2010s. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, Chinese state media singled out Li for not making his stance on the protests clear. At the height of the mass protests in September 2019, Li even publicly appealed to the government to show mercy to the young people. Therefore, beyond salvaging the strategic value of CK Hutchison’s port businesses, the CCP has the incentive to make an example of Li to assert its dominance over Hong Kong’s freewheeling capitalists. This is why Beijing’s mouthpieces have appealed to anti-American nationalist sentiments and ramped up the rhetorical pressure on the Li family, even though the actual strategic costs are likely less acute than the frequent invocation of “national security” by propagandists and Hong Kong’s political figures suggests. The mounting political pressure will serve as a warning signal to Hong Kong’s disloyal business elites. What’s Next? Beijing’s vociferous response to the CK Hutchison port sale has already had a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s business elites. While Hutchison’s port holdings represent a distinct strategic value for Beijing’s maritime strategy, as Xi expands the definition of national security, more sectors in Hong Kong may find themselves in a similar situation. Businesses could feel compelled to align with the political goals of the Chinese leadership, limiting their autonomy in pursuing commercial interests. Any intervention by Beijing not only validates Trump’s allegation about the strategic role of Hong Kong businesses to China, but also sets a precedent for further encroachments on Hong Kong’s private sector. Even if Beijing refrains from directly blocking the Panama ports deal, the underlying issue remains: Hong Kong’s business community still operates with a level of autonomy that Beijing increasingly finds unacceptable. Going forward, China will likely seek to reduce such autonomy, focusing on bringing strategic assets held by Hong Kong firms – including overseas ports and beyond – more directly under Beijing’s influence. The question is no longer whether Beijing will act, but how far it is willing to go.

Title: Canary CEO says firm’s unconventional altcoin ETFs are bet on emerging, overlooked tokens

Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CryptoSlate that the firm's goal is to find opportunities before they become a trend. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said the firm’s recent “out-of-the-box” crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings are a calculated approach to engage with assets that have potential and unmet demand. In a recent interview with CryptoSlate, McClurg explained the rationale behind the company’s filings, ranging from the first Litecoin (LTC) ETF to the first fund to give exposure to a non-fungible token (NFT) collection in the US. He explained: “If you’re a big shop like BlackRock, you can afford to take chances. If you’re a smaller shop like us, we don’t do anything unless we really feel like we can actually get it done. […] We’re pretty conscientious about our time and money, and we want to make sure that everything we’re doing is something that is viable.” On Oct. 16, Canary Capital filed an S-1 form to list the first spot Litecoin ETF, diverging from the trend of filings for spot Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs by other firms at the time. McClurg explained that the decision came after Canary realized that former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler named Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin as non-securities. He added: “Since the SEC had previously approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and we saw a couple of people file for Solana, we decided to look at opportunities that we believed would potentially get approval under the old administration. And we believe that one [Litecoin] had very good odds.” Additionally, McClurg said the firm believed at the time that the LTC token distribution model was unlikely to be classified as a securities offering, strengthening the decision to file for an ETF. On Nov. 12, less than one month after filing the first Litecoin ETF and diverging from the trend, Canary filed the first spot Hedera (HBAR) ETF. Analysts were surprised by the decision since HBAR is not part of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Additionally, Hedera only has $111 million in total value locked (TVL) on the network as of March 27, far lower than major Layer-1 blockchains. McClurg said that Canary filed for the ETF because it identified HBAR as a sound token with demand that had not come under the radar of other ETF issuers. He added that the firm’s goal is to find such opportunities before they become industry trends. In his words: “We want to find the opportunity that exists one year from now, two years from now, because if we are early to the punch, then we will get those flows when everybody else is scrambling to file.” McClurg also said that Canary believed that like LTC, HBAR’s distribution was unlikely to be classified as a security and the filing would “do well” under the former SEC regime. The price of HBAR spiked roughly 470% within a month after the ETF filing, jumping from $0.065 to $0.368 on Dec. 6, 2024, before giving up some of its gains amid the recent market downturn. HBAR was trading at $0.192 as of press time, up nearly 200% since Canary’s filing in November last year. Another of Canary’s moves diverging from major trends was the filing for a spot Axelar (AXL) ETF on March 5. The filing follows a similar thesis of preemptive positioning and has also surprised the crypto market since AXL is not among theough to be included in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. McClurg said that Axelar has received little mainstream attention but it is widely integrated into developer environments and protocol infrastructure. He added: “I was at ETHDenver, I was at a couple of other places, and I started talking to protocols. Every one of them is working with Axelar behind the scenes. I do mean every single protocol I talk to is working with Axelar in some way. And I thought that was quite interesting, that’s pretty high praise.” He contrasted Axelar’s behind-the-scenes interoperability functionality with earlier high-visibility projects like Polkadot (DOT), noting that Axelar appears to be executing more effectively in practice. This forward-looking approach extends to the firm’s views on the broader ETF landscape. Canary is also the first issuer to file for a Sui ETF, the 18th-largest crypto by market cap and the 8th-largest blockchain by total value locked in decentralized applications. McClurg criticized a common reactive strategy among ETF issuers, which tends to follow trends already underway. He said that Canary’s model instead focuses on early identification of demand and the development of products in anticipation of shifting investor focus. Canary also filed for an ETF tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. While McClurg declined to elaborate on that filing, he offered context around the company’s thinking on NFT-based investment products. He emphasized his background in intellectual property investing, ranging from fine art to entertainment rights, and the shift in regulatory stance that opened the door for tokenized digital collectibles. Following public statements from SEC officials indicating that NFTs and memecoins are not to be classified as securities, Canary saw a viable path to introduce NFT-based ETFs. The firm chose Pudgy Penguins over other collections, such as Bored Apes or CryptoPunks, due to its IP expansion beyond digital ownership, including physical merchandise and media content. McClurg stressed that while he has never personally held NFTs, Pudgy Penguins’ structure made it a more viable brand from a liquidity and IP standpoint. “[Pudgy Penguins have] done a better job of developing their brand and IP.” He added that this expansion into retail and animation supports the asset’s inclusion in a regulated investment vehicle.” As the co-founder of asset manager Valkyrie, McClurg worked on the firm’s Bitcoin ETF, which was approved later than expected. He said the experience has made him cautious about the timeline for altcoin ETFs and he is hesitant to make a firm prediction. However, McClurg said he wouldn’t be surprised if up to four single-token altcoin ETFs are approved this year considering the improving regulatory landscape under the SEC’s new leadership. He concluded: “I think a lot of them will probably be approved next year.” Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

Title: BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund raises Bitcoin exposure by 1,810% over 12 months

The amount of IBIT shares raised by 91% between quarters, totaling a $47.4 million Bitcoin exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund increased its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) through its spot exchange-traded fund, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), by roughly 1,810% since the ETF was launched in January 2024. According to a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 2, the fund held 821,664 shares of IBIT as of Jan. 31, valued at approximately $47.4 million. Comparatively, it only held 43,000 shares of IBIT at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The latest disclosure also reflects a broader trend of steady accumulation by the Global Allocation Fund. The fund’s exposure is up 91% since the end of the third quarter of 2024 when it reported 430,770 IBIT shares. The position was worth just over $17 million at the time. Meanwhile, the latest share count is roughly 4x higher than the 198,874 shares recorded at the end of the second quarter. The consistent upward trajectory in the fund’s Bitcoin exposure over the past year indicates a sustained interest in increasing its exposure to Bitcoin. The Global Allocation Fund, which manages approximately $15.8 billion in diversified assets across US and international equities, fixed income, money markets, and short-term securities, now allocates 0.25% of its portfolio to IBIT. Despite the small percentage, this marks a substantial rise from the 0.1% portfolio share reported in October. The ate of increase signals a growing willingness by BlackRock to integrate digital assets into traditional fund structures. Additionally, BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin into its $150 billion model portfolio, with a 1% to 2% target allocation to IBIT. The shift also highlights the expanding role of spot Bitcoin ETFs within diversified institutional investment strategies, particularly in the context of multi-asset portfolios managed by global firms. A recent report by River revealed that hedge funds and registered investment advisors have increased their Bitcoin exposure through ETFs by roughly 357% in 2024 to hit a total of $34.3 billion.

European equity markets finished in the red on Thursday as motor stocks were dragged by US president Donald Trump’s decision to slap a 25 per cent import tax on cars. The German Dax was firmly lower as Volkswagen and other car manufacturers lost value. The Cac 40 ended 0.51 per cent lower for the day and the Dax index was down 0.77 per cent. “The trade war has escalated and, unsurprisingly, German carmakers are leading the declines or are among the biggest decliners today. We saw sharp drops in shares of Porsche, Mercedes and other carmakers such as BMW and VW,” Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index said. Dublin US investment giant BlackRock confirmed on Thursday that it was behind the placing more than a 3 per cent stake in AIB on the market during the week, taking advantage of a surge in the share price so far this year. This brought its holding down to 8.48 per cent, according to a stock exchange filing. The bank’s share price rose 1.25 per cent to €6.07 while rival Bank of Ireland was marginally lower on the day at €11.26. Homebuilders Cairn and Glenveagh were down 3.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively as the Government mulls possible changes to the lending rules for developers in a bid to boost investment in construction. Europe European stocks fell, with weakness in shares of Europe’s top carmakers such as Volkswagen down nearly 2 per cent, while BMW lost almost 3 per cent and Mercedes-Benz slid more than 4 per cent. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 0.5 per cent after falling as much as 1.1 per cent to a two-week low. Euro zone bond yields dropped, with Germany’s 2-year yield hitting its lowest since March 5th. Tariffs and their effect on the global economy, as well as their potential to delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, have weighed on stocks in recent weeks, though they have shown signs of stabilising lately. London British equities closed lower on Thursday, with mining stocks leading declines, after US president Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all foreign-made vehicles and auto parts. Late on Wednesday, Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week, widening concerns about the global trade war he kicked off upon returning to the White House this year. The FTSE 350 automobiles and parts stocks fell 1.4 per cent to their lowest since early January, with luxury carmaker Aston Martin falling 6.7 per cent to an all-time low. The blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 0.3 per cent, while the midcap FTSE 250 index was down 0.6 per cent. Finance minister Rachel Reeves said Britain was working intensely with Washington to secure an exemption from the US, the second-biggest importer of British-made cars, on auto tariffs and could review subsidies enjoyed by Elon Musk’s Tesla to better support its industry. Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta were among the top decliners in the FTSE 100, falling between 1.4 per cent and 6 per cent. On the flip side, Next gained 10.5 per cent after raising its profit forecast for the current year, as the clothing retailer’s earnings topped one billion pounds for the first time. New York Wall Street seesawed between marginal gains and losses on Thursday, as investors grappled with president Trump’s latest trade gambit that sent auto stocks into a tailspin, all while digesting a myriad of economic data. In a late-night announcement on Wednesday, Trump unveiled his plan to implement 25 per cent tariffs on imported cars and light trucks effective next week, while those on auto parts are expected to begin from May 3rd. Trump’s mercurial trade policies have injected a dose of uncertainty into markets, as investors fret over potential disruptions to supply chains, hampered investment, and the specter of inflationary pressures threatening global economic growth. “We believe that he’s using (auto tariffs) as a trade negotiation. The markets are jittery because nobody really knows what’s going to happen and what will come out in future,” said Nicolas Lin, chairman and interim chief executive of Aether Holdings. Automakers faced significant pressure, with General Motors plummeting 7.7 per cent and Ford declining 3 per cent. Car-parts manufacturers such as Aptiv and BorgWarner each experienced a 5.5 per cent drop. Tesla defied the trend, rising 4.6 per cent, bolstering the consumer discretionary sector. Analysts highlighted that the electric vehicle maker might remain unscathed by the auto tariffs. - Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRP Moon Time? Ripple’s Garlinghouse Confident Of XRP’s Inclusion To U.S. Stockpile After Landmark Legal Victory

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, anticipates a “wave of XRP ETF approvals” in 2025 and also sees XRP as part of the Donald Trump administration’s proposed digital asset stockpile. Garlinghouse’s optimism came after the favorable resolution of Ripple’s protracted legal brawl with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which concluded with the securities watchdog wrapping up its case against the blockchain firm last week. Several XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will go live in the second half of this year, said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a March 19 interview with Bloomberg Crypto. “I have immense confidence in the ETFs,” Garlinghouse posited when asked about his confidence in XRP’s prospects. As of March 20, roughly 10 companies had filed for spot XRP ETF vehicles in the US, including major issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, among others. American asset manager Franklin Templeton became the latest to join the XRP ETF race. Despite the increasing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — the largest spot Bitcoin ETF issuer — has yet to submit paperwork for its own XRP-based investment vehicle. “I think those will be live in the second half of this year,” Garlinghouse predicted. The Ripple boss noted that XRP exchange-traded products outside the United States are already seeing inflows while other crypto-based ETPs bleed investor cash. “I think that’s because you had this false negative pressure from the SEC, this kind of an exogenous hand holding things down that’s now being released,” he explained. The SEC’s dismissal of its years-long lawsuit against Ripple, ending over four years of legal action against the company for an alleged $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering, sparked a notable market reaction. In the immediate aftermath, the price of XRP surged by double digits to peak at $2.57, according to CoinGecko data. XRP also briefly overtook USDT to become the third-biggest crypto by market cap, behind only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Discussing President Donald Trump’s planned crypto stockpile, Garlinghouse dismissed speculation of the exclusion of XRP, voicing confidence in the token’s inclusion: “XRP was named by the President of Truth Social. (He said) there’s gonna be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto stockpile that will include things like XRP. The CEO of Ripple told Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak that seized digital assets, including XRP, would create a crypto stockpile separate from the strategic Bitcoin reserve. The president’s executive order signed in early March explicitly indicates that the government would not purchase additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through criminal seizures.

Share this article BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund has increased its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by 91% to 821,664 shares valued at around $47 million as of January 31, according to a Thursday SEC filing. The globally diversified investment strategy, designed to maximize total return while managing risk, added 390,894 IBIT units to its portfolio between November 2024 and January 2025. The fund has steadily expanded its IBIT holdings from 43,000 shares in April 2024 to 198,874 shares in July 2024. Apart from the Global Allocation Fund, BlackRock previously disclosed holding $78 million in IBIT shares across two investment funds—the Strategic Income Opportunities (BSIIX) and the Strategic Global Bond (MAWIX). According to the firm’s most recent disclosure, the BSIIX fund owned 2,140,095 IBIT shares worth approximately $77 million, while the MAWIX fund maintained 40,682 shares valued at about $1.4 million, as of September 30. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust has drawn massive investments from hedge funds, pension funds, and institutional investors since its launch. Mubadala Investment, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, reported last month that it had purchased almost $437 million worth of IBIT shares during the first quarter of 2024, representing one of the first significant investments in crypto assets by a major sovereign wealth fund. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) also doubled down on IBIT, revealing a $321 million investment by the end of 2024. As of March 25, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund had around $49,5 billion in assets under management, according to the fund’s official website.

Title: Has ESG investing lost its shine? Spark finds friends and worries over Synlait’s weak second half – Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. ESG investing has been put on the back foot. Photo / 123rf Environmental, social and governance investing looks to be on the back foot, particularly in the United States after the change of Government. In the US, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing faces pushback under the presidency of Donald Trump – and there are signs of a change of heart in Europe as well. The term “ESG” has steadily faded from the investor and corporate lexicon over the past year after cultural and political clashes over its meaning and purpose, a report published on the Harvard Law School Forum said. Institutional investors have gone quiet on ESG amid public criticism and congressional subpoenas. Investment giant BlackRock had publicly disavowed the term for having become too politicised and the use of “ESG” in earnings calls had dropped precipitously, the report said. Robbie Urquhart, senior portfolio manager Australian equities at Fisher Funds, said the US and other jurisdictions have seen a shift in their approach to ESG. “In response to that, there are a number of corporates and fund managers globally that have altered their stance on ESG,” Urquhart told Stock Takes. “But from our perspective, we have not changed our approach to ESG investing in response to these changes. “The rationale that underlines that still holds today,” Urquhart says. “When you have fads either by moving the ESG dial more in favour of being stricter or becoming more relaxed, to the extent that you have short-term gyrations in how the pendulum swings, we are unlikely to alter our approach.” From an environmental perspective, changes in attitude towards ESG would not alter the need for the world to decarbonise over time, Urquhart said. “Some of those shifts that we have seen in the US are possibly in response to the parameters being too strict, given the pace of technology changes is taking longer than some would have hoped. “Nevertheless, the world still needs to decarbonise and as a consequence, it is still in investors’ interests to try and help push towards a decarbonised future in a sensible fashion.” Urquhart noted the pushback on ESG, particularly in the US, looked to be strong. Irrespective of how the US may be moving against ESG, Urquhart didn’t think the local “institutional landscape” had altered that much. “I would be surprised to see huge changes in New Zealand investment policy off the back of what we have seen in the US.” But Urquhart said it would be interesting to see how ethical investing evolves in the European market over time, given the likely military build-up there. “Clearly, we have seen a big step up in promises for defence spending in the European countries, and defence generally has not been a great destination for ESG funds.” It’s been a luckless year or two for Spark. A string of earnings downgrades has acted to drive Spark’s share price to 14-year lows, but the telco has found a friend in US investment behemoth BlackRock, which has lifted its stake to 8.07% from 5.9%. And brokers Forsyth Barr have upgraded the stock to “outperform”. “We expect structural, competitive and cyclical headwinds to slowly start to ease through 2025,” Forsyth Barr said in a research note. “While the structural decline in broadband and cloud gross margins is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, pressure on corporate mobile in particular and enterprise IT services should start to abate as [competitor] 2degrees begins to prioritise returns over market share gains, and Spark’s partnership agreements reduce costs and cyclicality in IT services. “Outside of the fundamentals, we believe the dissonance between Spark’s cashflow generation and its ambitions has contributed meaningfully to the 60% drop in the share price over the last year.” The broker said the combination of: (1) maintaining a 25 cents per share (cps) dividend; (2) retaining the A- credit rating; and (3) funding its data centre (DC) ambition was not a feasible proposition. “We struggle to understand why it is taking so long to correct, but expect it to be done within the next 12 months,” Forsyth Barr said. It expected the dividend to be reduced to 18cps. “The uncertainty around funding its DC expansion remains high, but most outcomes should be positive – including abandoning the expansion altogether.” Spark’s shares rebounded off their lows this week. They now trade at around $2.08. Forsyth Barr analysts Paul Koraua and Rohan Koreman-Smit continue to view The Warehouse Group’s performance as unattractive, describing its 2025 first-half result as “less worse than expected”. Of particular concern for Koraua and Koreman-Smit was The Warehouse’s heightened promotional activity and aged inventory, which contributed to a group gross margin contraction of 170 basis points, along with a 7% decline in gross profit versus the prior corresponding period. Koraua and Koreman-Smit did think that costs were well controlled by the group, with personnel and lease expenses broadly flat year on year and IT, SaaS (Software as a Service) and travel expenses down by 7%. The Warehouse has set an internal target to reduce its cost of doing business to below 31% in the near term (it currently sits at 31.3%), but the pair believe this target will be a challenge to meet. This is because sales momentum is likely to remain weak in the near term, there are timing uncertainties around further IT savings due to contractual terms and personnel and lease costs are generally inflationary. The Warehouse has maintained its initial guidance for the second-half result, expecting an operating loss of $14 million, in line with the second-half result in 2024. However, Koraua and Koreman-Smit continue to believe in a downside to the guidance, noting heightened promotional pressure and gross margin exit run-rates in the second quarter of 2025. The pair also expect domestic consumer spending to remain subdued over the next six months. They are forecasting a second-half operating loss of $18m, with no expected dividend until the second half of the next financial year. Shares in The Warehouse now trade at around 90c, having dropped by about 42% over the last 12 months. Synlait Milk’s first-half ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $63.1m was meaningfully ahead of what Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie would have forecast six months ago, but he says the outlook for the second half is unclear. The dairy processor is guiding to net debt of $250m–$300m by the end of 2025 (prior guidance was $200m–$250m). This included the Bright Dairy loan of $130m but excludes lease liabilities of $55m. Synlait is targeting senior leverage to ebitda of 2.5 times in full-year 2025 (which includes lease liabilities but excludes the Bright Dairy loan). “The midpoint of Synlait’s debt guidance and 2.25x gearing (target <2.5x) implies ebitda of $90m,” Montgomerie notes. “This in itself was not confusing, but the lack of commentary around why second-half 2025 performance is expected to be so weak versus 1H25 was.” The outlook for a2 Milk – Synlait’s biggest customer – remained robust. “While favourable foreign exchange and stream returns ($12m year-on-year ebitda benefit in 1H25) may abate, it is still difficult to reconcile the weak implied guidance,” Montgomerie said. Synlait’s shares have fallen, post-result, to around 76c, after last month hitting a high for the year of $1.02.

Title: French WealthTech firm RockFi raises €18 million

Less than a year after an initial fundraising round of €3 million, RockFi, the French fintech aiming to revolutionize private wealth management through its combination of seasoned advisors and cutting-edge technology, has announced a Series A funding round of €18 million, led by Partech, with renewed participation from Varsity and several business angels, including Arthur Waller and Félix Blossier, both co-founders of Pennylane. 0 27 March 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. This new capital will allow RockFi to accelerate its growth and achieve its goal of €1 billion in assets under management by the end of 2026.Founded in 2023 by Pierre Marin, Marie Bedu, and Maxime Durand, in association with former private banking directors including Stéphane Carles (ex-director of SG Private Banking) and Vincent Pagny (ex-director of HSBC Gestion Privée), RockFi is a French fintech redefining private wealth management through its network of independent private bankers and its technology platform.The Rockfi Experience: An Exclusive Approach Serving a New Generation of InvestorsRockFi serves a clientele of entrepreneurs, senior executives, top athletes, and artists seeking high-performance, responsive wealth management tailored to modern needs. These investors favor a tailor-made approach where human expertise is combined with a reimagined digital experience for greater simplicity and transparency.RockFi distinguishes itself through its family office approach, providing each client with a dedicated private advisor capable of building a comprehensive investment strategy encompassing financial investments, taxation, and estate planning.Its premium offering includes 3,000 financial instruments across all asset classes, with a strong focus on private equity through 30 established partnerships with prestigious firms such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs.Thanks to its proprietary technology platform, RockFi provides clients with a global reporting of their assets, featuring real-time tracking and in-depth analytics.Exceptional Growth and Confirmed TractionLess than a year after launching its commercial offering, RockFi has already attracted 500 clients, driving a monthly business growth of over 25%. At the same time, its workforce has expanded rapidly, reaching 50 employees, including 25 private bankers, distributed across six offices in France (Paris, Lille, Bordeaux, Lyon, Annecy, and Toulon).This remarkable traction illustrates the pertinence of RockFi’s model, which combines top-tier human expertise in wealth management with the power of technology to offer a premium and accessible service.“We want to breathe new life into private wealth management, to the careers of those who shape it and the assets of their clients. This financing will enable us to scale up to serve our customers even better, in France and - eventually - across Europe, with the ambition of rapidly establishing ourselves among the leaders of next-generation wealth management”, says Pierre Marin, co-founder and CEO of RockFi.Over the next 12 months, RockFi plans to recruit 50 additional private bankers and open one new office per month, starting with Nice, Cannes, Toulouse, Rennes, and Strasbourg. This territorial expansion aligns with the company’s commitment to providing closer and more tailored support to regional investors and entrepreneurs.Top-Tier Investors to Support RockFiThis Series A round brings RockFi top-tier financial partners. Partech is joining the capital of the company by leading the round; on this occasion, Philippe Collombel, co-founder and General Partner at Partech, is joining the RockFi board of directors. Varsity, the fund co-founded by Didier Valet (former Deputy CEO of Société Générale) which had already led RockFi’s seed round in 2024, has reinforced its commitment by making a significant reinvestment. RockFi also counted on the support of strategic business angels such as Aurthur Waller and Félix Blosser (co-founders of Pennylane) and Mark Ransford (former Managing Director of Apax UK).“We are delighted to support RockFi in this new phase of its growth. Its model - combining a technological platform with human expertise - addresses a strong demand in the wealth management sector. The traction gained in just a few months shows RockFi’s potential to become a key player in an industry that is about to transform,” said Phillipe Collombel, co-founder and General Partner of Partech.“Since the beginnings of RockFi, we have been convinced by Pierre and his team’s vision to transform private wealth management. In less than a year, they have executed this vision with remarkable efficiency and tangible results. As early investors, it seemed natural to us to strengthen our support in this Series A to support RockFi in its expansion”, added Didier Valet, co-founder of Varsity.An Innovative Technological Wealth Management OfferingThe funds raised will allow RockFi to continue innovating and expanding its service offerings. In March, the fintech launched a dedicated client app, which provides each client with a comprehensive and detailed report of their entire financial portfolio in real time.RockFi relies on a team of 12 engineers, which it plans to double this year, to monitor, report, and identify investment opportunities tailored to each portfolio.In addition, RockFi integrates both French and Luxembourg-based life insurance solutions to optimize the tax and estate planning strategies of its high-net-worth clients. It also offers a wealth engineering service including personalized tax declaration assistance, offering clients a unique and comprehensive approach in the market.

New York-based investment firm I Squared Capital has pressed the start button on the long-awaited multibillion euro sale of its Irish electricity and gas utility Energia, nine years after it bought the business, say sources. Investment bankers from Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Santander, who were hired a year ago to advise on sale strategy, have begun calling potential interested parties, said the sources, who declined to be identified. It is anticipated that an initial round of non-binding bids will be called by early June. An enterprise value of €2.75 billion, including debt, had been put on the business a year ago when it emerged that I Squared was preparing a third attempt to sell it. A spokesman for Energia, which is led by chief executive Ian Thom, declined to comment. [ Planners approve Energia data centreOpens in new window ] The decision to start the process comes within days of An Bord Pleanála giving Energia permission to build a data centre in Huntstown, Co Dublin, in partnership with tech giant Microsoft. It also comes as Energia enters the final days of its financial year to the end of March. I Squared, founded 13 years ago by former executives at Morgan Stanley’s infrastructure arm, acquired Energia – then known as Viridian Group – in 2016 from Bahrain’s Arcapita Bank for €1 billion. Arcapita had owned the company for almost a decade. The US firm subsequently sold a minority stake in Energia to an unknown investor the following year and set up a holding company over the business in the Cayman Islands. I Squared made two unsuccessful efforts to sell the company before now, in 2018 and 2020. UK-based Octopus Energy is teaming up with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to consider a bid for Energia, industry publication PeakLoad reported in recent days. Other potential bidders include investment giants KKR, BlackRock and Brookfield and utility groups Centrica and SSE, say sources. Energia reported earlier this month that its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) dipped to €238.3 million for the nine months to the end of December from €246.7 million for the same period in the previous fiscal year. The three parts of Energia’s business – renewable energy, a flexible electricity generation business, and a unit supplying customers – have proven to be complementary in recent years despite upheaval across energy markets. Ebitda in its renewables business, which owns 358 megawatts (MW) of wind assets and purchases electricity from 1.19 gigawatts (GW) of third-party green energy producers, and customer solutions unit, which supplies 866,700 homes and businesses on the island of Ireland, declined over the nine months amid lower energy prices. However, earnings in its flexible generation unit, mainly made up of two combined cycle gas turbine plants in Huntstown with a total capacity of 747MW, advanced. This was fuelled by greater use of the plants – used to plug gaps in electricity supplies in the Greater Dublin Area – during the period as well as the opening earlier this year of an emergency 50MW gas-fired electricity plant on the Huntstown site. The approval of the data centre will give investment banks marketing Energia a fresh angle to pitch the company’s growth opportunities to potential suitors. Energia also has a solar energy pipeline of more than 1,200MW.

Tether's investment in Be Water reflects its broadening influence beyond stablecoins. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoin issuer Tether continues to expand beyond financial technology with a fresh investment into Italy’s media landscape. On March 27, the company revealed a €10 million capital injection into Be Water, an Italian media firm. As part of the deal, Tether will secure a 30.4% equity stake in the company by the end of the month. Be Water produces and distributes film, television, audio, and live content. Tether’s investment aims to accelerate international expansion while supporting its digital infrastructure with blockchain and advanced tech tools. The partnership is also expected to enhance the company’s ability to distribute independent content across global platforms. With this deal, Tether’s growing investment portfolio now spans media, biotech, sports, and video platforms. Previous deals include $775 million in Rumble, a stake in Juventus Football Club, and a $200 million investment in BlackRock Neurotech, a company developing brain-computer interface technology. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino highlighted the importance of preserving editorial independence. He said the investment would help Be Water avoid pressure from commercial narratives and maintain its creative freedom. He stated: “While often Media companies are bullied into kneeling to sponsored narratives simply to survive, Tether’s investment in BeWater ensures that the group will continue to remain solid, visionary and especially independent.” Despite Ardoino’s claim, the investment has shifted Be Water’s ownership structure. The updated shareholder list includes Guido Maria Brera, Giancarlo Devasini, and Paolo Ardoino from Tether, along with a mix of industry professionals such as Mario Calabresi, Roberto Condulmari, Saverio Costanzo, and Barbara Salabè. At the same time, Be Water’s board will also see changes, with Brera named Chairman and Salabè stepping in as CEO. Other board members include Claudia Lagorio, Tether’s COO, and Sabrina Giovannetti, Be Water’s CFO. Meanwhile, the media company is rolling out a major development plan. This includes investing in next-gen digital infrastructure, expanding its investigative journalism arms, Chora and Will, and partnering with international film, TV, and documentary production talent. While Tether continues venturing into new sectors, the firm’s core business remains strong. In a social media post on X, Ardoino pointed out that USDT stablecoin recently crossed 400 million users worldwide and remains the largest in the industry, with a market cap of over $140 billion. He described USDT as a grassroots solution bridging financial gaps where traditional systems fall short. According to him: “We always focused on the adoption from the ground up, working in the streets, among other people, while traditional finance was watching at us from their ivory towers.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change.

Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo reportedly joins a growing number of financial institutions embracing Bitcoin amidst heightened corporate demand. Italy's plan to hike crypto tax from 26% to 42% faces pushback from within ruling coalition amid industry backlash. Crypto users said they would consider leaving Italy due to the high tax regime. Rumble aims to revamp digital asset adoption among global creators with a new wallet, following a $775 million Tether investment. The new stablecoin could be launched within the next five weeks, potentially based on a dynamic incentive system. According to the BaFin, the sUSDe offer "profit promises," potentially classifying it as a security. Alex Thorn highlighted that the current text of the GENIUS Act leaves Tether free to avoid registering in the US.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. Tesla, Elon Musk’s electric car company, has seen its share price fall by almost half since its December highs (as traders eye a Federal Reserve “big catalyst”). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Tesla, one of the so-called “Magnificent 7” tech stocks that includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia, has ridden a U.S. president Donald Trump stock market “bump" but is struggling amid a sell-off that led Musk to issue a crypto price warning. Now, as fears swirl a new, mystery threat is targeting crypto, Standard Chartered analysis has found replacing Tesla with bitcoin in the Magnificent 7 delivers higher returns and lower volatility—calling the index Mag7B. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has seen the company's share price collapse by almost half since it ... More hit an all-time high in December. "We find that Mag7B has both higher returns and lower volatility than the Magnificent 7," Geoffrey Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. "This suggests that investors can view bitcoin as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation. Indeed, as bitcoin’s role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized." Bitcoin has seen huge Wall Street adoption in the last year as a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) become some of the fastest growing funds of all time and companies follow Michael Saylor’s Strategy in buying bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. “If it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as bitcoin would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,” Kendrick said, adding the Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year but has fallen sharply along with Tesla and ... More stock markets in recent weeks. The bitcoin price has soared over the last year, boosted first by Wall Street and then by Donald Trump’s embrace of bitcoin and crypto on the campaign trail. The bitcoin price surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s election victory and has since declined along with Tesla and other sky-high tech stocks as traders de-risk in the face of Trump’s tariff threats. “It’s true that replacing Tesla with bitcoin would improve the historic returns of the Mag 7 group,” John Haar, managing director at bitcoin-buying app Swan Bitcoin, said in emailed comments. “However, the same can be said for including bitcoin in favor of any stock in the group. Over the past 10 years, the best performer of the Mag 7 has been Nvida, which has returned approximately 70% per year. Bitcoin has returned approximately 80% over the past 10 years.”

Through the generosity of the AHLA Foundation, five students and I had the opportunity to attend the Hunter Hotel Investment Conference in Atlanta last week. I love attending conferences because they’re fun, you make friends, and they often get me thinking in a new direction or about something new in general. And that’s just what happened in Atlanta. During the “Wall Street” session segment of the conference, there were some very heavy hitters discussing the relationships between brands and owners. To put the scale of the participants into context, we’re talking about leaders from companies like Hilton Worldwide and BlackRock. They were discussing potential purchases in the billions of dollars. The four participants and the moderator were truly big dogs. One interesting concept that all parties seemed to agree on was the concern about the commoditization of the hotel product. I think this concern is completely warranted, as it increasingly seems to me that hotels of different brands are very similar to one another. One of the ideas suggested (that is leading to the commoditization of hotels and their brands) was the increasing fragmentation occurring in the industry. Obviously, there are exceptions to this fragmentation, but it does seem that many owners do not operate their properties – certainly not on a day-to-day basis; many brands do not own their properties; and even the hotels themselves are viewed more as “revenue-generating assets” rather than “hotels”. This last point was highlighted further as some major owners had focused their capital on investments in different “revenue-generating assets” – things like data centers. In speaking to some smaller owners and brokers, they noticed this shift away from hotels, too. In fact, one of the hottest trends in “revenue-generating assets” right now is daycares. All this got me thinking: With all this fragmentation that is occurring, how will this impact the future? My conclusion is that it will allow for more and more specialization within the hotel industry. As part of our experience at the conference, the AHLA Foundation set up several intimate sessions with industry leaders. These allowed for frank discussions as well as Q&A sessions for the students. Each of these smaller sessions was incredibly inspirational, and all of the leaders were hardworking, charismatic, and very smart. Although I probably could have filled this entire article with quotes from the sessions, there was one that stood out to me: This quote, connected with the increasing fragmentation that has occurred in the industry, really got me thinking about opportunities that will exist in the future, particularly for young professionals and students. In another general session on artificial intelligence, there was an “aha” moment for me that put the opportunity much more in focus. The people on the stage in the AI session (who were experts) only had about two years’ worth of experience working with AI. The newness of AI in general is a huge opportunity for anyone. Even a complete novice can get ramped up quickly on perhaps the biggest technological opportunity of all time. And I’ll give you an example of a quick ramp-up. In that same general session on artificial intelligence, a web development site (Lovable.dev) was mentioned. This site was described as somewhere that anyone could put in an idea and a website or app would be created. It was mentioned by one of the panelists, who said that his elementary-aged son logged on and created a basketball game within minutes. So later that evening, I checked the site out, and it really was incredible. I was able to very quickly create an accounting game: Financial Statement Classifier Game. Check it out – AI really is incredible and powerful. And that brings me back to the point of this article: to genuinely and enthusiastically encourage everyone out there with an entrepreneurial spirit to go for it! Because right now, at the intersection of fragmentation, specialized skills, and AI, it feels like many barriers that may have existed in the past have been broken down. So, ask yourself: If the answer to these questions is yes, then in my estimation, for you, the sky’s the limit. And if it’s not you? I still believe that looking for your specialty, identifying where you can fit in best, and learning about AI will also bring you great opportunities in the future. What a time to be alive! It’s not too late to get in on the AI boom and use all your talents and specialties to give yourself the next big opportunity. So go get it! Tucker JohnsonUniversity of Houston - Conrad N.

Title: Solana Eyes $300 as Bullish Sentiment Reaches Historic Levels

Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum reaches unprecedented levels. Notably, despite struggling since its all-time high of $264 in November 2021, battling market-wide downturns and increased token supply, including the recent FTX estate’s $2 billion SOL unlock, optimism is resurging. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional adoption and strategic integrations are fueling this renewed confidence. GameStop and BlackRock have launched yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, driving massive social media engagement. “The combination of technological advantages, institutional interest, community support, and influencer engagement has created an almost unheard-of positive-to-negative sentiment ratio of 18:1,” Santiment noted Thursday, emphasizing the growing confidence among institutional and retail investors. While market analysts remain divided on Solana’s trajectory, some predict an explosive rally. Analysts from Sandman Research pointed out that SOL recently retested a key support level near $100 before rebounding 16% to $146, mirroring a pattern seen in 2021 that preceded a major altcoin surge. “Is Solana history repeating itself? SOL has been consolidating near previous all-time highs for most of the year. A key level retest triggered a bullish reaction, and if history follows its 2021 trajectory, we could be on the verge of another major altseason,” the analysts wrote. According to analysts, Solana could surge to a minimum target of just over $1,750 if it mirrors its 2021 bull run, with the potential for an even greater upside. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes weighed in, recently suggesting Ethereum will hit $5,000 before Solana reaches $300. Although the pundit did not give timeframes, he has previously projected that Bitcoin could reach a market peak by late March 2025, suggesting that the SOL price could reach his target around that time, should BTC rally. Beyond technical, fundamental drivers are also boosting sentiment. Apart from its inclusion in the U.S. government’s proposed cryptocurrency reserve, institutional interest is surging, with Fidelity joining six other firms seeking SEC approval for a spot Solana ETF. If approved, Solana would be officially classified as a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, significantly enhancing its regulatory standing. Additionally, Circle issued an additional 250 million USDC earlier this week on the Solana network, potentially increasing liquidity and network activity. Further validation came as Interactive Brokers, one of the largest global brokerage firms, announced expanded support for Solana, Cardano, XRP, and Dogecoin, broadening mainstream exposure. With institutional backing, expanding network adoption, and surging bullish sentiment, Solana’s resurgence is impossible to ignore. At press time, SOL was trading at $138.16, reflecting a 4.43% drop in the past 24 hours.

Key barriers stand before ETH’s price action on the charts. Ethereum [ETH] recently reclaimed its realized price at $2,040 on the charts, signaling renewed optimism across the market. This move indicated that Ethereum could be entering a recovery phase after its prolonged bear market. At press time, Ethereum was trading at $2,064.80, following a slight 0.10% decrease over the last 24 hours. Historically, when Ethereum crosses its realized price, it marks the beginning of a bullish trend. Therefore, this could be a crucial turning point for ETH. However, it still faces several hurdles that could slow down its momentum. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio stood at approximately 1.02. MVRV ratios below 1 historically mean that a market bottom is near, while ratios above 2.4 indicate overvaluation. Ethereum’s press time position, therefore, signaled that while in a recovery phase, the altcoin was not yet overvalued. On the charts, Ethereum faces substantial resistance ahead at the $2,300-level. According to the MVRV Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands, this level marks a critical barrier that ETH must clear for a sustained bullish trend. ETH is also trading within a falling wedge channel near the upper boundary. Therefore, the price action around $2,300 will be pivotal in determining whether Ethereum’s recovery continues or stalls. Source: TradingView Whale activity continues to support the mid-term bullish case for ETH. Notably, BlackRock recently accumulated 1.25 million ETH worth around $2.5 billion – A sign of heightened institutional interest. However, on-chain metrics pointed to some mixed signals. Ethereum’s exchange reserves increased to 18.375 million ETH, up +0.18% in the last 24 hours. Rather than indicating demand, this uptick may suggest growing sell-side pressure as more ETH is being deposited into exchanges – Often a precursor to potential profit-taking. Meanwhile, user activity has remained strong, with 20,913 active addresses recorded – A +0.99% hike over the same period. This uptick in active wallets hinted at sustained network engagement, a positive sign for ETH’s fundamental health. On the contrary, Ethereum’s gas usage dropped sharply to 2.19 billion ETH – A steep decline from recent highs near 22 billion. This could reflect lower transaction volumes or fall in smart contract execution – Potentially signaling a short-term cooldown in network activity. Source: Santiment As predicted previously by AMBCrypto, Ethereum now faces a critical resistance zone between $2,200 and $2,250. Breaking above this zone could pave the way for a retest of the $2,400-level. However, if ETH struggles to maintain its momentum, it could face a pullback to the $2,000-support level. Therefore, market participants will need to watch for signs of either a breakthrough or a potential reversal. Ethereum has seen some strong signs of recovery, with positive MVRV ratios and growing institutional interest. However, the $2,300-resistance remains a significant hurdle. While ETH has the potential to break through this level, overcoming it will require sustained buying momentum and the clearing of key barriers. Given the prevailing market conditions, Ethereum is likely to face challenges in breaking this resistance in the short term.

Title: How the Irish ‘spice bag’ became worthy of inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/2025/03/27/how-the-irish-spice-bag-became-worthy-of-inclusion-in-the-oxford-english-dictionary/

The addition of the spice bag to the most recent update of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) signals official recognition at last for the fast food staple people in Ireland have been enjoying for nearly 20 years. The OED attributes the invention of the spice bag to a Chinese takeaway in Dublin’s Templeogue called the Sunflower around 2006. By 2010 the spice bag had become the first dish since the chicken fillet roll to grab us by our culinary cojones and inspire a movement that has since gone global. In 2021, Deliveroo took it upon themselves to launch a Change.org appeal to the Irish government to greenlight a national spice bag day. No doubt the request is still under serious consideration. This odd fusion dish, in all its paper wrapping glory, has by now eclipsed its fast-food origins to become a cultural phenomenon. It is unapologetically Irish, with a surprisingly international twist, part comfort food, part hangover cure, and part guilty pleasure. But how did this quirky concoction come to dominate our late-night cravings? For the uninitiated, a spice bag is a glorious mishmash of crispy shredded chicken (or chicken balls), chunky chips, stir-fried vegetables, and a generous shake of hot seasoning. This golden, greasy delight is often topped with red chillies for a fiery kick and usually comes with the obligatory curry sauce. No two spice bags are the same – every takeaway has its secret blend, as fiercely guarded as the recipe for Coca-Cola. While no one can pinpoint the exact date spice bags began to appear on menus, the consensus is that it was sometime between 2006 and 2010. In 2016, RTÉ reporter Liam Geraghty embarked on a quest to discover who invented Ireland’s most-ordered takeaway item, and his journey brought him to the Sunflower Chinese takeaway in Templeogue where it is said the spice bag was born when staff came up with a post-work fusion snack. Others argue that its roots may lie in Galway or Cork, but wherever it began, its spread was rapid. Combining the flavours of Chinese five-spice, chilli powder and paprika with the Irish obsession with fried potatoes was a stroke of genius. It’s a marriage of two culinary traditions in a way that’s both unexpected and utterly addictive. It is salty, spicy, crispy and carb-heavy – hitting almost every comfort food craving. The chicken is typically deep-fried, providing a satisfying crunch, while the chips soak up all the seasoning goodness. The vegetables (usually a mix of onions, peppers and maybe a rogue carrot or two) add sweetness and texture, balancing out the heat from the all-important chillies. And then there’s the seasoning – the spice mix is where the real magic happens. While recipes vary, most blends include a mix of Chinese five-spice (a fragrant combination of star anise, fennel, cloves, cinnamon and Szechuan peppercorns), garlic powder, chilli flakes and a touch of sugar. The result is a flavour bomb that provides excellent soakage and instant gratification. Spice bag expert and all-round takeaway virtuoso Chris Mellon of @DublinSocial says: “I noticed the popularity of the spice bag at the start of 2023 and decided to create a series visiting our top eight recommended takeaways. The eight videos posted to Dublin Social’s Instagram and TikTok channels gained over 22 million views. Mind-boggling for such a simple dish. We had people all over the world messaging us on how to recreate the dish at home and in restaurants. Some of the world’s biggest online chefs have even done their own version. “I cover every type of restaurant but the popularity of these videos had people screaming spice bag recommendations at me in the street. What makes a great spice bag? For me, it’s all about the chilli. This might be controversial but my favourite is actually served in a tray. Red Rice in Kimmage serves theirs with lashings of their chilli mix, and it has a proper kick.” For Dublin-based food and drinks writer Shamim de Brún, it took a little longer to find her way to worship at the altar of the spice bag. “When I came home after college everyone was talking about it like I should just know what it was, so I pretended I did, ‘cos I was insecure and 21. Then I had one for the first time after a night out – it was only a fiver with a drink, and I was like, ‘I get it now.’ I love it when there’s loads of onions and peppers, which I know they’ve been pulling back on. I am forever a dipper not a douser when it comes to sauce. I think an air-fried spice bag is better than the original. And champagne is the best drink to have with it.” San Sab Thai restaurant and takeaway in Drumcondra (with outlets also in Clontarf and Blackrock) is renowned for its award-winning spice bags. Owner Zoë Magliocco has had them on the menu since it opened its doors in 2017, and the Thai-style spice bag is still its biggest seller. But what makes the San Sab spice bag different? According to Magliocco, there are several factors. “We use fresh chicken fillets that are prepped and breaded in-house each day, as is the (plentiful) veg.” Magliocco goes on to explain that San Sab doesn’t use MSG in the spice bags, and the house blend of Thai spice results in a lighter, fresher dish. [ Spice bag with Champagne? The best wines to drink with tonight’s takeawayOpens in new window ] With a kitchen fully staffed by Thai chefs, how did they feel about the addition of spice bags to an authentic Thai menu? “They didn’t want to do it,” says Magliocco, “but, as a business, they understood that it was needed.” With the Drumcondra branch on the doorstep of DCU, the queue for spice bags starts before the doors open, and the demand for the dish shows no sign of waning. The spice bag is so beloved that it has inspired everything from memes to merchandise, a dedicated Facebook appreciation society and a podcast. It has made its way into high-end restaurants and home kitchens, with jars of spice bag seasoning now sitting in kitchen cupboards around the country. Chefs have put their own spin on the dish, serving deconstructed versions, or using premium ingredients such as free-range chicken and hand-cut chips, and there are vegan and vegetarian spice bags, featuring tofu or plant-based chicken substitutes. The adaptability of the spice bag is part of its charm. Feeding both the stomach and the soul, it’s undeniably a suboptimal nutritional choice, but it ticks many, many boxes. A symbol of Ireland’s constantly evolving food culture, it’s a testament to the creativity of takeaway chefs and the changing appetite of Irish people. Make no mistake – the spice bag is here to stay. Exclusive competitions and restaurant offers, plus reviews, the latest food and drink news, recipes and lots more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRPL surpasses 2.8 billion flawless transactions – Major institutions are taking notice!

Could XRP Legder be the next game-changer for institutional adoption? Ripple is in the news after it reportedly reached a settlement with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), following the agency’s unconditional withdrawal of its appeal last week. This development adds to the wave of positive momentum around XRP. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to strengthen blockchain innovation, having processed over 2.8 billion transactions without a single security failure. In fact, recent data from CryptoQuant indicated a resurgence in XRPL activity since 23 March – Reversing a prior decline observed since 19 March. Owing to the same, XRP was trading just below $2.40 on the charts, up by just over 1% in the last 24 hours. Source: CryptoQuant The recent surge in XRP activity came on the back of remarks from Jasmine Cooper, RippleX’s Head of Products. She stressed on XRPL’s efficiency as a key factor attracting institutional investors. With its speed and reliability, XRPL is also becoming a preferred choice for asset issuers and institutional players. OpenEden, for instance, has achieved significant milestones in tokenizing U.S Treasury bills on the platform, offering institutional investors access to on-chain financial instruments. Additionally, BlackRock, a global asset management giant, is actively exploring asset tokenization, further aligning with XRPL’s growing role in the evolving digital finance landscape. Remarking on the success of XRPL, Cooper, in a podcast with Tony Edward, noted, “SockGen, for example, that are interested in issuing stable coins on the XRP ledger to asset managers that are participating with some of the tokenization platforms. There’s been, you know, Aberdeen has issued certain money market funds through Archax, which is a tokenization provider on the XRP ledger. So, I think there’s a wide range from banks to asset managers that are starting to discover the value of tokenization and of XRPL in particular.” The exec went on to say, “So, RLUSD is doing well. Adoption has been rapid. You know, there’s support in a variety of different centralized exchanges. Market cap is rapidly growing. So I think we’re excited about it.” Cooper further shed light on XRPL’s expanding ecosystem. She stated that it is setting the stage for broader adoption, driven by advancements in DeFi and cross-border payments. Finally, she noted how the introduction of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) has enhanced on-chain trading and liquidity, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges. RippleX’s efforts to integrate an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain that aims to attract developers by enabling Ethereum-based smart contracts while leveraging XRPL’s efficiency is also gaining traction. That being said, the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s new USD-backed stablecoin, has further strengthened the network’s utility. Particularly in cross-border transactions. Therefore, if RLUSD secures regulatory approval and gains institutional traction, XRPL’s adoption could accelerate, positioning it as a key player in blockchain finance.

Title: China tells state firms to halt deals with Li Ka-shing and his family: Report

East Asia Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings company, speaks during a press conference to announce the company's annual results in Hong Kong on Mar 16, 2018. (File photo: AP/Kin Cheung) China has instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his family after his plan to sell two ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led consortium, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday (Mar 27). CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Li, has been caught in China's crosshairs in the highly politicised deal with the United States firm. The Hong Kong-based company this month agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal, in a deal that would garner the firm more than US$19 billion in cash. The directive was issued to state-owned enterprises last week at the behest of senior officials, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Existing tie-ups are not affected. The report added that Chinese regulators are also reviewing what investments the family has in China and abroad in a bid to better understand the breadth of their business dealings. Shares of CK Hutchison Holdings rose 1.2 per cent by noon, down from a gain of as much as 3.6 per cent earlier in the day. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fuelled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale. Chinese regulators, under the instructions of central leadership, have begun looking into the deal, a source has told Reuters, a sign of Beijing's discontent with CK Hutchison's divestment under perceived US pressure. US President Donald Trump has hailed the transaction after previously calling for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he deemed to be Chinese control.

Title: The Racial Content of Advertising
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/03/the_racial_content_of_advertising.html
Time Published: 2025-03-27T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
In an advertisement currently running on TV, a young white male kneels on his front lawn, trimming the grass one blade at a time with a nail clipper. Next door, a slightly older black male sits comfortably on his porch, scanning his automated payroll accounts with an air of confidence and superiority as he looks askance at his foolish neighbor. In another ad, a large, middle-aged black woman dances and sings her way through the supermarket aisles, waited upon entirely by whites. At one point, she stands still, looking doubtfully at a middle-aged white male who has taken a break from mopping the floors. In the end, she breezes out of the store, her cart filled by white employees overjoyed to serve her. In yet another ad, two young girls are selling something like Girl Scout cookies — one using a payment app and another relying on cash. The black girl who uses the app has sold her entire wagonload of goods before the other has sold much of anything. At the end, the black girl wheels her wagon off with a baseball glove and ball inside (indicating she is headed out to play), looking back with a knowing smile at her less clued-in white neighbor. These are just a few of the dozens of ads now airing that depict whites in a demeaning manner and blacks as their superiors in intelligence and ability. “Racial superiority” was once regarded as immoral if not criminal, but now it is out in the open, with blacks consistently depicted as more capable than whites. Nearly every medical doctor in the media is depicted as a black male, a throwback to Dr. Huxtable on the Cosby Show. Increasingly, investment advisers and plant managers are depicted as black, despite the fact that in real life, 4.7% of medical doctors are black, while 6.3% of plant managers and 1.9% of investment advisers are black. The advertising world’s depiction of blacks bears no relation to reality; it seems to be driven by sheer ideology. Some will see this discrepancy as excusable and chalk it up to a sort of cultural affirmative action. For decades, whites were depicted in dominant roles. Old movies often portray black women as maids and black men as porters, as in fact many were, but those blacks who were successful in business or the professions, and surely there were many, were rarely shown. So the argument is that now it’s time for whites to be underrepresented. The problem is that when whites were depicted in superior roles, that was a reflection of reality. In 1960, the vast majority of doctors, managers, and other professionals really were white, much more so than today. In 1960, 2.8% of physicians in the U.S. were black. The causes of this low number were complex, more so than pure racial exclusion, but undoubtedly were often the result of unfair practices. Today, the vast majority of professionals are still white, but whites are almost universally depicted as inferior. It is a strange anomaly and not without consequences. No one can object to seeing black actors depicted positively in television ads. But the problem is that today, blacks are almost always depicted as superior to whites, and the percentage of ads that feature blacks in leading roles — the chief of the boardroom, the manager of the office, the factory supervisor, the smart investor, the well-spoken, well-groomed leader paired with a clueless white — is not credible. One consequence is anger on the part of whites. Most reasonable people are willing to judge others of all races on the basis of merit, but the depiction of whites and blacks in today’s advertising does not reflect merit. Whites who have worked hard in school, earned postgraduate degrees, and devoted themselves to their jobs find themselves depicted as innately inferior to blacks. They know that this is not the case, but there is no way to escape the barrage of hateful depictions. This racial inequality must be confusing for blacks as well, for surely they realize how insincere and dishonest the ads are. The ads are a form of racial pandering, and they may represent a desperate effort on the part of corporations to cover their bases: Large investors such as BlackRock and Vanguard control billions of shares of stock, sometimes amounting to 20% or more of a company’s stock. Those investors have reportedly become “woke” to the point of insisting on more positive portrayals of minorities. For those who do not understand the role of index funds in pressuring corporations, the racial content of advertising must be mystifying. But for many, the ads appear as confirmation that blacks have automatically received priority over whites throughout the culture. Non-minority workers who have lived through the years since affirmative action was widely implemented, which is to say, nearly all white and Asian workers, have suffered a lack of opportunity. They have been passed over for promotions, paid less, or outright excluded from employment, while less qualified blacks have been hired and quickly promoted based on their race. Private companies, schools and universities, the media, and the government have played along with this racist program, refusing to acknowledge that it is unfair. Tens of millions of lives have been harmed, but again, few have spoken out because of the fear of being accused of racism. There is racism in our country, but most of it is now directed against whites and Asians. We are expected to sit still and watch what we know to be a lie because radicals in the media and elsewhere believe they are righting the wrongs of the past. One does not right past wrongs by imposing a national program of anti-white and anti-Asian education, employment, and promotion. One does not “change the culture” by airing hundreds of thousands of ads that people know to be false. Blacks on television dressed up in white coats are not really doctors, but neither are blacks who have been passed along through college and medical school based on their race. Now, under President Trump, this form of “shameful discrimination,” as the president has called it, is being eliminated. Federal agencies are closing down DIE programs, and private companies have begun to modify their DIE programs as well to re-introduce “merit.” In the case of J. P. Morgan Chase, DIE has been modified to DOI (diversity, opportunity, inclusion), a step in the right direction. One would hope that individuals of all races will soon experience opportunity based on their performance, not their skin color. As for those annoying ads, I mute the sound or switch to another network so I don’t have to listen to them. Racism, no matter what form it takes or for what purpose, is anathema to the spirit of our country. Only by eliminating racism entirely will we bring about fairness based on merit for all Americans.

BlackRock is looking to add more people to its digital asset team as the industry grows in popularity among Wall Street firms. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, big names in finance have taken several steps to expand their presence in crypto. While BlackRock has long been a pioneer in the space, especially among traditional financial banks, the asset manager seems to have more in store. Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.

Title: Bitcoin: Are BTC miners holding for a bigger price jump?

Time Published: 2025-03-27T03:00:31Z

Bitcoin’s miner reserve stability, coupled with institutional interest, signals potential for price growth. Bitcoin [BTC]’s Miner Reserve has remained stable, with no significant selling activity recorded over the past 24 hours. This indicates that miners are holding onto their Bitcoin, signaling confidence in future price movements. Source: X The stability in miner behavior could suggest that miners are waiting for favorable market conditions to sell at higher prices. As a result, this steady behavior in the miner reserve is a key indicator to watch for potential shifts in market dynamics. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $88,020.88, up 1.53% over the past 24 hours. BTC has recently broken out of a descending trendline and was bouncing off the demand zone. This suggests strong buying interest around these price levels, which could help push Bitcoin higher. The Bollinger Bands indicated that BTC was nearing the lower range of its bands, suggesting that consolidation is in play or a breakout might be imminent. Additionally, the RSI reading of 53.25 showed neutral market sentiment, signaling no overbought or oversold conditions at the moment. Source: TradingView Looking at Bitcoin’s In/Out of the Money chart, the majority of addresses holding BTC are in profit, with 78.28% of addresses “in the money.” This distribution is important because it signals strong support levels beneath the current price. Furthermore, it suggests that the market sentiment is generally bullish, as most holders are in profit. The absence of significant losses in BTC holdings could be a sign that the price has enough upward momentum to avoid a significant pullback. Source: Coinglass At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) stood at 0.501, showing that the market is in a profit zone. A positive NUPL reflects strong market sentiment, with most Bitcoin holders enjoying unrealized gains. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s whale activity has been noteworthy, highlighted by the recent transfer of 2,760 BTC. Institutional investors, such as BlackRock, are also accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Earlier this year, BlackRock purchased $42 million worth of BTC, reinforcing the prevailing bullish sentiment. Combined with whale movements, this institutional activity indicates that key players are preparing for potential future price surges. With stable miner reserves, a positive NUPL, and a breakout from a descending trendline, Bitcoin appears positioned for an upward move. Institutional accumulation, including BlackRock’s $42 million Bitcoin purchase, alongside notable whale activity, adds fuel to this potential rally. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC can sustain its momentum and solidify a stronger bullish trend.

Scheduling Note: There will be no newsletter March 27th. I may be in your inboxes Friday if we get the readout of the March Politburo meeting, and it is interesting. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots - Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, gave a fiery press conference today. He denounced, as usual, the DPP and Taiwan President Lai, and also announced a new “Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots 台独’打手、帮凶迫害台湾同胞恶劣行径举报专栏”. You can submit reports to jubao@suremail.cn. 2. Reaction to latest US entity listings - The Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said the “U.S. move is intended to suppress and contain entities from other countries and deprive other countries of their rights to development. It will seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of relevant entities and undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. This U.S. move is not conducive to creating an atmosphere for both parties to resolve issues through dialogue and cooperation”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said it is “typical hegemonic behavior, seriously violating international law and norms, damaging corporate rights and undermining global industrial and supply chain security”. 3. He Lifeng and USTR head talk - United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held an “ introductory” video meeting with Vice Premier He Lifeng. Both readouts make it sound pro-forma, but at least there is a channel for discussion, especially as we are just a week away from Trump’s tariff “liberation day”. 4. Trump dangles Tariff cuts for TikTok deal - In a press conference today he said “TikTok is very popular, very successful, very good. And we're gonna have a form of a deal. But if it's not finished, it's not a big deal; we'll just extend it. I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want. We have a lot of interest in TikTok. China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly, in the form of an approval maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.” 5. CK Hutchinson-BlackRock ports deal - According to Bloomberg the two sides expect to sign an agreement next week, even as Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao launched another broadside against the deal, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, both central government bodies, again reposted it. It is not at all clear what Beijing or Hong Kong can do to block the deal, but there is still time to find a way. 6. IShowSpeed livestreaming from China - IShowSpeed is a livestreamer with 37 million YouTube followers. He is livestreaming from China this week and he is loving it. The Global Times praised his visit, writing “amid recent "China Travel" fever, more foreign internet influencers are visiting China. Among them, American YouTube sensation Darren "IShowSpeed" is under the spotlight with his ongoing China travel. “What are the odds this IShowSpeed PRC tour is organic and not officially supported in some way? Even if it has no official backing, it is a huge soft power win for the PRC. And if the tour does have official support then the cadres involved deserve promotions. The PRC embassy in the US is a fan: Earlier today I published this week’s episode of Sharp China - Welcoming Foreign Enterprises; Ships are the New Chips; He Weidong and More PLA Rumors; Deep-Sea Cable Cutter. From the show notes: On today's show Andrew and Bill begin with the China Development Forum, including China's messaging to foreign investors, revisiting the Mintz raids as five detained employees are finally released, no updates on a Xi-Trump meeting, and news in the EV space. From there: The US plans to revive shipbuilding capacity, the likely disruption if the US adopts the USTR recommendations to counter Chinese dominance, Michael Froman writes that China has remade the international system, and a few more thoughts on the CK Hutchison deal. At the end: Rumors swirl around He Weidong and others in the PLA, what the noise might signal, and news of a deep-sea cable cutter is accompanied by a reminder that China constructs and protects deep sea cable like no other. You can listen to it here.

Title: Old Bitcoin Whale Transfers $250 Million Worth of Assets After 8 Years

A dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after eight years, transferring huge assets and leading the community to a frenzy. Over the years, ancient whales mostly become active after a major price uptick to maximize gains. These new fund movements can affect other whales, depending on the dominant market sentiment. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the dormant whale transferred 3,000 BTC worth approximately $250 million. The whale’s stash grew from $3M in 2017 to the present levels. This transfer led to heated debates on the asset’s direction in the coming weeks. “$250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS. A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote on X. The move coincided with a 4.7% weekly uptick in Bitcoin’s price. For most holders, the whale might seek to sell assets following the recent price recovery. This month, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have faced significant headwinds, plunging over 20%. This also sparked a similar reaction from other whales looking to secure previous gains. This year, the market has recorded an outflow of large holders, leading to a price drop from its all-time high above $108k to present levels. Traditionally, whale movements swing the market due to the size of their holdings. Present market forces also led to huge sales from Bitcoin miners plunging reserves. On the flipside, previous dormant whales have added to their holdings or repositioned assets. Recent activities around the leading crypto have triggered a 4% jump in the last seven days. After weeks of negative trading, bulls set their sights on a renewed surge past the $90k mark. According to Arkham, BlackRock accumulated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin without making a sale last week. Most institutional investors have also followed this trend. Furthermore, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 6,911 coins last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in holdings. Most traders remain positive on the upward asset trajectory, citing recent developments from whales. The U.S. regulatory space marking a handful of pro-industry wins heightened bullish confidence in the market.

Title: BlackRock Debuts Bitcoin ETF In Europe Following Blockbuster IBIT Success

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has launched a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe following the wild success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Since its debut, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra, and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” a prospectus on the iShares website reads. The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points, reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, told Bloomberg: “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator. IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets, accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year, it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments. While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. This makes BlackRock’s Europe ETP much cheaper while the waiver is in place.
