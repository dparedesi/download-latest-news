Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The first step in reducing the risks of climate change is cutting carbon emissions. The world hit a notable milestone on that front, with global energy-related emissions likely peaking last year, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Now, the world’s carbon pollution is likely to begin a long, inexorable decline over the coming decades. But there’s a catch: Emissions almost certainly won’t fall fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5 C target set in the Paris Agreement. Increasingly, hitting that target looks like it will require the world to turn to technologies that can suck carbon straight from the air in a bid to turn the global thermostat down. Investors have spent years laying the groundwork to develop a sector that has the potential to undergird carbon markets that BNEF estimates could reach $1.1 trillion in the coming decades. Companies from Occidental Petroleum to Microsoft along with firms like BlackRock and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures are among the investors throwing billions at startups. The U.S. government has been a significant patron, with the Energy Department committing more than $1 billion to get carbon removal off the ground. But funding and buyers of carbon removal services have so far targeted a narrow subset of techniques to clean the atmosphere. And U.S. federal support is now up in the air as the Donald Trump administration pursues funding cuts to all manner of climate programs. This is happening in what is shaping up to be a formative period for the carbon removal industry as companies attempt the perilous journey from pilot projects to commercialization, said Robert Hoglund, co-founder of carbon removal clearinghouse CDR.fyi. To ensure the industry has a fighting chance to reach the scale needed, it will need an enormous financial boost. "If we don’t get new buyers, we’re stuck in the seed stage,” he said. There are at least eight broad categories for removing carbon to clean up the atmosphere, with more than 900 startups trying different approaches. The money that's been rushing into the carbon chase has overwhelmingly backed a technique known as direct air capture (DAC), which involves using machines to suck up carbon. Firms are placing major bets on it even though the technology remains unproven at scale, inordinately expensive and energy intensive. Far less investor money is flowing to competing methods such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean and using crushed rocks, a process known as enhanced weathering. Between 2020 to 2024, firms have bet $3.3 billion on DAC compared to $3.4 billion for all other novel approaches, according to publicly available data compiled by CDR.fyi. The technology receives a disproportionate amount of private investment because it’s backed by U.S. federal tax credits and grants, according to Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. That support isn’t because the government decided DAC is the best way to remove carbon, he said, but "because the political economy of the oil and gas industry is much more powerful than these other emerging industries.” Carbon removal buyers looking to meet their climate targets have also not diversified their portfolios. Almost 60% of all purchases tracked by CDR.fyi between 2019 and 2024 are for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It involves burning wood to run power plants, then capturing and sequestering the resulting emissions underground. Hence, the CO2 the trees and plants pull from the atmosphere during their lifetimes stays put. Despite the interest, research has found that cutting down and transporting feedstock can emit more carbon than it sequesters, making carbon accounting a big challenge. BECCS made up about 85% of Microsoft’s 8.2 million metric ton portfolio for novel carbon removal through 2024 tracked by CDR.fyi. The technique "offers attractive costs with an achievable scale inside the 2030 timeline,” said Brian Marrs, the company’s senior director of energy and carbon removal. Bioenergy plants already exist, and retrofitting them for carbon capture is arguably faster than building and scaling novel carbon removal technology. Since 2024, Microsoft has only added to its BECCS portfolio, signing a landmark 6.75 million ton deal with Houston-based developer Fidelis New Energy earlier this month to purchase removal from a plant being built near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It’s the largest deal for novel carbon removal to date. The company also recently added another 3.7 million ton purchase from CO280 Solutions, which captures CO2 from pulp and paper mills, reflecting Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its climate commitments. Microsoft takes a "portfolio approach” to procuring carbon removal, balancing costs, deployment timelines and scale potential for different methods, Marrs said, adding that the company also purchases nature-based carbon credits in addition to engineered removals. BECCS’s dominance is not to say DAC or other technologies haven’t seen big purchases. According to CDR.fyi, Oxy subsidiary 1PointFive has sold 1.3 million tons of carbon removal services to companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Airbus, making it the largest DAC purveyor. Its next-closest competitors, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, have each sold a bit more than a quarter of that amount. Yet these approaches have yet to live up to their promise. Through 2024, DAC delivered around 1,200 tons of CO2 removal — less than 0.2% of all carbon removed over that time frame — and BECCS has delivered 10,000 tons — less than 1.7% of the total — per CDR.fyi. Just a handful of companies are buying the bulk of carbon removal credits. Microsoft alone is responsible for the majority of carbon removal purchases to date, though Alphabet’s Google and Stripe are also among major buyers. That’s because durable removal isn’t cheap. Using DAC can cost upwards of $1,000 per ton of CO2. Compare that to standard forest carbon credits, which are often sold for under $10. "The only way to make this scale is to make it mandatory,” said Wim Carton, an associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden. Carbon removal is a public good governments should treat as akin to a "trash removal service,” said Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global public policy and external affairs. That approach should also include sticks, he added, much like littering results in a fine. But with Trump — who has called former President Joe Biden’s climate legislation "the green new scam” — the odds of the U.S. doubling down on climate regulation are low. What climate scientists want investors and entrepreneurs to understand is that carbon removal has a narrow set of appropriate use cases. The first is cleaning up legacy emissions. Decades of humanity’s CO2 is lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. If the Earth were an overflowing bathtub, turning the faucet off — cutting emissions — wouldn’t be enough to stop the water from spilling over. You also need to open the drain. The second use is for the unavoidable, steady drip of CO2 for decades from sectors like agriculture and aviation. All other applications of carbon clean-up technologies could do more harm than good since they risk slowing down emissions cuts today by promising removals down the road, Carton said. That’s especially true for using captured CO2 to extract more fossil fuels, a practice that climate researchers agree needs to be rapidly wound down. Exactly how much carbon the world needs to remove from the atmosphere depends on how quickly that happens. In a scenario where humanity dramatically curbs emissions, scientists estimate that 4.8 billion tons of CO2 removal will be needed annually by mid-century to keep the climate stable with all of it coming from conventional methods like planting trees. In what’s an increasingly likely scenario of continuing to burn fossil fuels, the planet will require almost 9.8 billion tons annually to compensate for the added emissions with 3.5 billion of that from novel techniques like DAC. The world is nowhere near that. Through 2024, about 13 million tons of carbon removal credits have been sold since CDR.fyi began tracking the market for novel carbon removal, what Cullenward called "a rounding error.” The clock is ticking on scaling that up. "We’re far too late, and we’ve eaten up too much of the carbon budget to say that we don’t need it,” said Sabine Fuss, co-chair of the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. While DAC and BECCS are attracting the most investment and purchases respectively, they’re crowding out other promising carbon removal technologies. Some startups use clever engineering to accelerate natural processes, like increasing the ocean’s alkalinity. Others are electrolyzing seawater and spreading crushed basalt rock over farmland. These methods promise greater durability, verifiability and effectiveness of storing CO2 than simply planting trees. Another method has provided the majority of all carbon removal delivered: biochar. It’s done so without the support of U.S. tax credits, large purchases from brand-name buyers or billions in investments. In some ways, biochar is the "unrecognized star” of carbon removal, said Carton. Compared to other methods, it’s cheap and doesn’t require much upfront capital expenditure or high-tech research and development. Making it requires kilns to heat biomass, and the resulting charcoal-like product can also be used to help improve soil fertility. But like all carbon removal techniques, there are downsides, the biggest being uncertainty about how much CO2 stays sequestered when it’s added to different soils. That’s an area of active investigation for researchers. "It’s got so much potential, but it’s inconclusive,” said Ben Kolosz, an assistant professor in renewable energy and carbon removal at the University of Hull in the U.K. Still other methods like ocean alkalinity enhancement and enhanced rock weathering hold even greater promise to capture and store vast amounts of CO2. But they are not as "approachable” or "intuitive” as technologies like DAC, which may give investors and would-be buyers pause, said Anu Khan, founder and executive director of the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative. CDR.fyi’s Hoglund compared the carbon removal industry’s efforts to the pharmaceutical industry's pursuit of new drugs. "You need huge upfront investments for it to work,” said Hoglund, who is also the manager of the Milkywire Climate Transformation Fund, an organization that supports carbon removal, decarbonization and nature-based projects. That ultimately means securing committed buyers with deep pockets. "We need many Microsofts to start scaling this,” he said.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.

The stakes ratchet up in the All-Ireland League on Saturday as the competition shifts from 18 rounds and eight months of league action to the playoffs in all five divisions. In Division 1A only six points separated the top four and there’s little in the way of a form guide judging by previous clashes. St Mary’s College v Cork Constitution, Templeville Road, live on irishrugby+: Promoted St Mary’s have taken the division by storm (witness 13 try-scoring bonus points in 18 games) to earn a home semi-final against the champions. A single point separated them in the table and ditto in their two meetings; a 27-27 draw at Temple Hill in November and Con’s 30-29 win at Templeville Road in January. St Mary’s fielded a weakened side in Clontarf a fortnight ago but Mark McHugh is expected to recall key man Conor Dean at outhalf and summer signings Greg Jones and Dan Goggin. Con make two changes from their 47-45 win over Terenure. Veteran centre Niall Kenneally is restored and, with Mark Donnelly on Munster duty, David Good starts at loosehead. They are seeking to become the first club to retain the AIL title since Shannon in 2006. Clontarf v Lansdowne, Castle Avenue (4pm) Live on irishrugby+: Emulating Clontarf’s astonishing 49-46 win at the same venue in January will be nigh impossible, as a 12-try rollercoaster was won by Conor Kelly’s penalty with the last kick. Clontarf are seeking to regain the title they won in 2022 before losing in the final a year later, and with a largely rebuilt side. They tend to be clinical after gaining access to the opposition’s 22, and that January extravaganza was one of five games that they have won with the last play. They make just one change to the side that sealed a home semi-final by beating St Mary’s a fortnight ago, with Stephen Ryan starting on the left-wing and two players added to their bench as sides are allowed 23-man squads in the knock-out stages. By contrast, Lansdowne rested most of their frontliners for the win over Garryowen a fortnight ago. Hence, Declan Fassbender recalls 11 players, with Charlie Tector starting at inside centre. Lansdowne, who beat ‘Tarf 26-17 at home back in November, have won eight of their last nine matches as they aim for their first final since 2018. The weather may possibly be more to Clontarf’s liking. City of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Nenagh Ormond v Blackrock College, New Ormond Park: City of Armagh surprisingly slipped into ninth in 1A, whereas UCC climbed into fourth in 1B, on the last day. The students include four recent or current Ireland under-20/Munster academy players in Ben O’Connor, Gene O’Leary Kareem, Seán Odogbu and Michael Foy. Although Nenagh Ormond finished six points above Blackrock, their two wins over them were tight – 38-36 away in September and 21-17 at home three weeks ago. James Blaney is seeking yet another promotion with ‘Rock, who are missing injured Ireland under-20 scrumhalf Oliver Coffey. Cashel v MU Barnhall, Spafield (2.30pm); Dublin University v Greystones, College Park (2.30pm): Cashel and Barnhall also met in last season’s playoffs, the latter winning by two points in Spafield before losing to Queen’s in the playoff final. Barnhall finished second, one point above Cashel, thanks in part to a 30-17 home win over the Tipperary club in January and two bonus points from a 36-33 loss in the February reverse fixture. Trinity are trying to avoid successive relegations and will be favourites at home to Greytones, who finished fourth in 2A. Cashel finished just one point above Barnhall. Dungannon v Clogher Valley, Stevenson Park (2.30pm); Navan v Galwegians, Old Balreask (2.30pm): Navan finished ninth in 2A in their centenary season, and will host Galwegians, who had theirs a year previously, after the Galway club squeezed into fourth in 2B at the end of a fairly luckless campaign in which eight of their nine losses were by a score.

Title: XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight

With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge. According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. In a recent podcast, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP. The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs. The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments. More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Canary Capital on Friday filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The staking feature of the Canary Staked TRX ETF would allow investors to earn extra yield with their investment. The fund’s “investment objective is to seek to provide exposure to the price of Tron,” the filing said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary has filed for a number of crypto ETFs. The fledgling crypto-focused asset manager is hoping Wall Street’s biggest regulator will give the green light to Sui, Pudgy Penguins, and XRP funds. Those applications are part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, a result of last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have garnered more than $35 billion in net inflows over a 15-month period. The prospectus, also called a registration statement, did not say on which exchange the proposed fund would trade. Staking, the process of pledging proof-of-stake assets to a network to help it function in exchange for rewards, has been a controversial issue in regulators’ consideration of crypto ETFs. Proponents maintain that staking will lead to wider institutional adoption of crypto products, but critics view it as an unnecessary risk for investors. The SEC has yet to approve a staking feature in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator delayed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum. Tron, which trades as TRX and is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was recently trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain, and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares and VanEck are among the long list of major fund issuers currently seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs tracking different digital assets. Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs are the most likely to receive approval next.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. READ MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy? “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Title: Coinbase and traditional financial firms poised to benefit from US stablecoin legislation

Firms such as PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard could have direct benefits, while Charles Schwab and BlackRock could gain indirectly. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report. The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards. Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange’s model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins. Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation. The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities. Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions. Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers. Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line. Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area. The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers. In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone. The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets. The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC. As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.

By BERNARD CONDON, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

By BERNARD CONDON, Associated Press Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products.

Friday, April 18th, 2025 As the Western hemisphere wound down trading activity with the onset of the Easter holidays, crude oil markets have posted an impressive 7% week-on-week rise, with ICE Brent now back at $68 per barrel. New OPEC+ compensation quotas, tighter US sanctions on Iran, and relatively upbeat March macro data have all boosted sentiment in the short term, although further US-China escalation could upend this week’s recovery. US Ratchets Up Pressure on Iran. The Trump Administration issued new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports, including the Shengxing Chemical teapot refinery based in Shandong province for purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, the second Chinese refiner to be hit with direct sanctions. EIA Is Bleeding People After DOGE Check. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) is reported to have lost more than 100 employees in the latest round of resignation offers put forward by Elon Musk’s DOGE drive, possibly losing up to 40% of the EIA’s 350 employees, putting data publications at risk. Mauritania Exports Its First Ever Gas Cargo. UK energy major BP (NYSE:BP) has finally loaded its first LNG shipment - aboard the British Sponsor LNG carrier - from the 2.3 mtpa Greater Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) facility offshore Mauritania, following a six-week delay to the export terminal’s commissioning. Equinor’s US Wind Ambitions Dissipate. US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum mandated a halt to construction of the Empire Wind offshore project developed by Norway’s state oil firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) off the New York Coast, citing insufficient environmental analysis before approval. BlackRock Gets Ready to Buy Up Utilities. The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to own major stakes of public utility companies, a joint 2023 motion of 16 Republican-led states decrying its ESG investing demands on utility companies. Bahrain Resumes LNG Imports. Despite being a producer of oil and sharing a huge oil field with Saudi Arabia, the Middle Eastern kingdom of Bahrain is set to resume importing LNG after a five-year hiatus, with a 170,000 m3 cargo from the US Sabine Pass LNG facility moving towards the Arab Gulf. Europe Has Now Only Two Russian Buyers. The Czech Republic has officially halted its imports of Russian crude after the Transalpine pipeline (TAL) from Italy’s Trieste boosted throughput capacity to 900,000 b/d, with Czech refiners now getting all of their oil needs from the seas. Congo Taps Blackwater Know-How. Erik Prince, the founder of private military firm Blackwater, has allegedly signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure the country’s vast metal reserves and reduce cross-border smuggling of commodities amidst ongoing warfare in Eastern Congo. Trading Firms Eye Italian Refinery Sale. Global commodity traders Glencore (LON:GLEN) and Gunvor are considering buying Italy’s API downstream firm, operating two refineries in Ancona and Trecate, totalling 200,000 b/d in capacity, with Azerbaijan’s state oil firm SOCAR also keen to purchase the asset. Force Majeure Saps Malaysia’s LNG Supply. Malaysia’s Petronas, operator of the giant 29.3 mtpa Bintulu LNG export terminal, is experiencing production issues due to boiler malfunction, setting a pricing floor for Asia’s JKM gas futures that are set to rebound from their 9-month low of $12 per mmBtu. China Hits New Coal Record. China posted another all-time high in coal production as the March supply totals amounted to 440.6 million tonnes, up 9.6% from a year ago, worsening the country’s coal oversupply and forcing power utilities to cut their coal imports by 6% month-over-month in March. Refiners Flee California Regulatory Hell. US refining giant Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) filed its request to ‘idle, restructure or cease’ operations at its 170,000 b/d Benicia refinery next to San Francisco by April 2026, marking the second refinery closure in California in less than a year amidst rising regulatory costs. America’s Copper Dream Is On. Following years of stalling and controversy, the Trump administration is set to approve a land swap that would pave the way for Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and its project partner BHP (NYSE:BHP) to launch one of the world’s largest copper mines, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona. Ukraine Signs Watered-Down Minerals Deal. Ukrainian authorities stated that Kyiv and Washington have signed a memorandum of intent on developing mineral resources in the Eastern European country, aiming for the establishment of a Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with a full deal expected next week.

The funds raised will be for its airports business, specifically for the upcoming airport at Navi Mumbai, the first phase of which is scheduled to commence operations in June this year, according to indications given by its airport arm. Sources said that the group was confident that a public issuance of bonds would get strong traction from US investors, a view bolstered by a recent $750 million private bond placement by an Adani group offshore promoter entity that was subscribed by leading investors including the world’s largest asset manager Blackrock. In February, the group had raised $200 million through a private bond placement for its port operations in Australia. The group is now looking for a larger fund raise through a public bond issue, and the indications are that it could be some time in the middle of the year. In February, US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order directing the US Department of Justice to stop prosecuting Americans who had been accused of bribing foreign officials to secure business contracts. More recently the Trump administration indicated it was rolling back enforcement of certain kinds of white-collar crimes including bribery charges. These developments have been seen as benefiting the Adani group, which is facing bribery and securities fraud charges there. Last year group founder Gautam Adani and several other executives were charged by US law enforcement bodies with bribing officials in India to get solar power contracts for Adani Green Energy, which at that time was raising funds in the US. Any public issuance targeting US investors would require registering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also probing the group over the alleged securities fraud. The Navi Mumbai International Airport, in which the Adani group has a 74 per cent stake, will commence operations with one terminal handling 20 million passengers annually. It will be ramped up in phases to reach a passenger-handling capacity of 90 million. Published on April 18, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: The dollar's sell-off raises concerns that investors are losing trust in the U.S.

Watch CBS News April 18, 2025 / 10:22 AM EDT / CBS/AP Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years — a drop that raises concerns investors may be losing confidence in the U.S. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects deeper investment concerns as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. "Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye." The sell-off in the dollar has accompanied turmoil in both the U.S. stock and bond markets, with investors selling off shares and Treasuries amid concerns about the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs on corporate growth and investment. The S&P 500 remains 14% lower than its most recent peak in February, placing it in correction territory. "Particularly disturbing is that both U.S. stocks and bonds fall during these periods—a phenomenon common in emerging markets but rare in developed markets and almost never in America," said Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst. "This is an unambiguous signal from traders that trade wars are sharply curtailing the 'exorbitant privilege' the U.S. has enjoyed for the past half-century." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. To be sure, many investors don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. Some experts say the dollar's decline may be due to its overvaluation, rather than any underlying changes in the strength of the U.S. The dollar "has been overvalued for too long," said Eurizon SLJ Capital in a research note. "All over Europe, we have for years been seeing a tsunami of American tourists, because it was cheaper for an American to fly to Europe to ski than to an American resort 2 hours from home ... A correction in the dollar is just and healthy." But even that is concerning enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that "exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a "confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, "It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar's reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. "Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with," says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. "At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. " They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, "If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin." Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs.

It's not just the tariffs, but the way he's rolled them out, with numerous halts and delays. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money, experts say. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is "ripping off" America, as Mr. Trump puts it. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation.

More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Title: BlackRockâs Panama port deal stirs debate over Chinese chokehold on strategic shipping routes

Trump warns of strategic risks as BlackRock seeks $22B Panama Canal ports deal. Panama Canalâs US-built legacy at stake amid Chinaâs opposition to the acquisition. BlackRockâs global port control could weaken Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative influence. Military experts highlight Panamaâs vulnerability to port blockades disrupting global trade.

US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. President Donald Trump's recent congressional address has thrust the Panama Canal into the spotlight of a new geopolitical contest. Trump highlighted BlackRock's proposed $22 billion acquisition of ports at either end of the Panama Canalâcurrently owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchisonâcalling attention to the strategic risks of foreign control over vital infrastructure. The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

"This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt Nikita Casap sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, discussing relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. The Wisconsin teen accused of killing his parents to obtain financial means to assassinate President Trump and overthrow the United States government was allegedly working with foreign entities, including someone with a Ukrainian phone number and someone in Russia, according to an FBI affidavit. He also asked his contact who would be blamed for the attack, and was told "Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal." Nikita Casap, 17, of Wisconsin, allegedly sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, who writes in Cyrillic, discussing going into "hiding" before relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison. Additionally, to avoid detection, the instructions advise to not bring a cell phone." In a Telegram chat from January 21, 2025, it was revealed that the goal of the operation was to blame Russia for the assasination. ...more TOPICS: KEYWORDS: assassinationplot; heroofzeeperland; nikitacasap; trump; ukraine; zeeperhero Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-34 next last 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: bitt Wow, what a genius. 2 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:31 PM PDT by yldstrk (Nothing like the truth) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: bitt What was his Reddit/Bluesky handle? 3 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:44 PM PDT by RushIsMyTeddyBear ("Uncle Sugar" is being audited and having an enema.)

We never would have had any details on this if Christopher Wray was still in charge. Routh was never in a Blackrock commercial. It was just a rumor that got started by some idiot on X/Twitter trying to get attention and clicks. The ultimate false flag? Yes, I see that you’re right. Routh was in a video to raise money for the Azov Battalion unconnected to Black Rock. I wonder what his Zeeper.. err FReeper name is. I wish for complete defeat of Ukraine and victory for Russia.

Realty firm Prestige Estates Projects Ltd sales bookings rose 48 per cent to nearly Rs 7,000 crore in January-March quarter, but pre-sales declined 19 per cent to over Rs 17,000 crore in the last fiscal. Prestige Estates attributed the fall in annual sales bookings numbers to lower launches of housing projects due to a lack of approvals from development authorities. As a result, the company has failed to achieve the annual sales bookings guidance of Rs 24,000 crore. In a regulatory filing, Bengaluru-based Prestige Estates shared its operational performance for the fourth quarter of the last fiscal and the full 2024-25 financial year. The company’s sales bookings stood at Rs 6,957.4 crore in the January-March quarter of the last fiscal, an increase of 48 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y).

Prestige Estates said the sales bookings during the 2024-25 fiscal declined 19 per cent to Rs 17,023.1 crore, “reflecting the impact of deferred launches amid approval delays”. Sales volume for 2024-25 stood at 12.58 million square feet, down 38 per cent Y-o-Y. Total units sold across FY25 stood at 5,919. The average realisation for apartments, villas, and commercial products rose to Rs 14,113 per square feet, an impressive 36 per cent increase Y-o-Y. Plot sale realisation increased to Rs 7,167 per square foot, registering a 50 per cent Y-o-Y growth. Irfan Razack, Chairman and Managing Director of Prestige Group, said, “FY25 brought with it a mix of achievements and challenges. Despite delays in project approvals that deferred a few key launches into the next fiscal, the final quarter saw strong traction in sales and an encouraging uptick in realisations. “ The appetite for quality real estate remains robust, as evidenced by the outstanding response to the company’s recent launches, he added. “Our focus on customer-centric offerings and premium positioning has also translated into meaningful growth in per square foot realisations. FY26 is set to be a defining year for Prestige Group as we expand into newer markets, launching marquee projects in NCR and Mumbai and achieving our maiden residential completions in Mumbai,” Razack said. “With approvals progressing and the demand environment holding steady, we are optimistic about scaling new heights in the coming year and deepening our presence across key geographies,” Razack said.

As part of the deal, Tata Elxsi will establish a dedicated global engineering centre focused on SDV platforms, electrification, body and chassis, and cloud-native development.

Read more With FY25 constant currency (CC) revenue growth at 4.2 per cent, which follows a very weak FY24 in which the CC revenue growth was at just 1.4 per cent, Infosys is staring back at its weakest two-year performance in almost the last 25 years. However, this is not the end of the slowdown, with the company guiding for FY26 CC revenue growth of 0-3 per cent, with the upper end of 3 per cent based on optimistic management assumptions that there will be steady to marginally improving business environment. That could be a hard ask, given the global tariff-war driven uncertainties and the US recession probability having increased in recent weeks.

Mumbai: Ahmedabad-headquartered Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said Thursday that it will buy a port terminal in Australia’s Queensland from a promoter company in a non-cash deal that values the 50-million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) capacity asset at an enterprise value of A$3,975 million (approximately ₹21,640 crore or $2.5 billion). The Adanis’ flagship port company will issue 143.8 million equity shares to Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (CRPSHPL). CRPSHPL is a promoter-owned entity that ultimately owns the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT). The transaction will see promoter shareholding in APSEZ go up by 2.13 percentage points to 68.02%. APSEZ had first purchased the port terminal in 2011 for about ₹9,000 crore, as per news reports. However, the asset was sold to the Adani family in 2013 to manage the debt of the listed company.

The terminal is strategically located on the East-West trade corridor, he said. The company is aiming to grow the Ebitda from the asset to A$400 million (about $255 million) in four years, Gupta further said. It recorded an Ebitda of A$ 228 million in FY25. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The terminal has a rated capacity of 50 MTPA and the company estimates that the capacity can be ramped up to 120 MTPA as demand grows. In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the terminal handled 35 million metric tonnes of cargo, the company said. As part of the transaction, APSEZ will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities associated with the terminal. However, APSEZ’s leverage will remain at similar levels post the transaction, the company said. Read this | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever NQXT is a natural deep-water, multi-user export terminal at the Port of Abbot Point, approximately 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government till the year 2110. The terminal has a “high quality customer base” operating in the Bowen and Galilee mining basins. These mining companies export metallurgical and energy coal to over 15 countries from NQXT. APSEZ is India’s largest commercial ports operator, and accounts for almost one-fourth of the cargo movement in the country. The expansion is part of APSEZ’s stated goal of handling 1 billion tonnes per annum capacity by 2030. It handled 450 million tonnes in FY25, as per an investor presentation. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹26,711 crore in FY24, and net profit of ₹8,104 crore, per data from the BSE. The company's shares closed 2.2% higher at ₹1,259.90 on the BSE on Thursday.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

Bernard Condon Associated Press Published: April 17, 2025 at 7:25 PM Updated: April 18, 2025 at 3:26 PM Bernard Condon Associated Press NEW YORK – Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. Recommended Videos The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost."

Title: All Yellow - Frank McNally on singing Emily Dickinson, Joyce’s advanced maths, and quantum mechanics in Blackrock

Full Content:
The fact had somehow escaped me until an email responding to Wednesday’s column about Emily Dickinson. And I’m not sure if I wasn’t better off without the information. But as I now know, for good or bad, most if not all of Dickinson’s poems can be sung to the tune of a traditional American ballad, The Yellow Rose of Texas. For this, I’m indebted to reader Seán Lyons, who tells me he first learned it from a lecture by an American professor at Listowel Writers’ Week a few years back. A long-time admirer of Dickinson, Lyons now sees her in a completely different light: “I cannot read her poems since without mentally donning a 10-gallon hat, and heading towards the sunset, just my rifle, my pony, and me.” Sure enough, I too have suddenly taken to humming “Hope is the thing with feathers–/That perches in the soul”, in a jaunty, thigh-slapping, hoedown rhythm. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,/And Mourners to and fro” has also acquired a whole new personality. But it’s not just The Yellow Rose of Texas, apparently. There are many other songs you can sing Dickinson’s poems to just as well. That’s in part because she wrote in ballad (or hymnal) meter. It may also be an effect of her famous dashes, which break up the lines in a way that Ronnie Drew might have done, to pause for beneath. Whatever the reason, it makes my image of her sharing a bench on the Royal Canal with Brendan Behan seem even more plausible. I don’t know if The Yellow Rose of Texas was one of Behan’s party pieces, but in his memoir Hold Your Hour and Have Another, he mentions someone else singing it in his presence during a pub session in Co Down once. Yellow was not an apt colour that day. It was the Twelfth of July, in the overwhelmingly unionist village of Millisle. Despite being a red-roaring republican, the mischievous Behan was disappointed the old man singing did not choose “something more Orange”. Discussing Euler’s Identity, “the most beautiful equation in maths”, in Thursday’s Irish Times, Peter Lynch was nevertheless mystified as to why a recent visitor to the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove wrote the formula into the visitors’ book. I don’t know either, but perhaps the tower’s circularity inspired thoughts of Pi, one of the numbers used in the equation? Or maybe the visitor was responding to what he saw as the beauty of Joyce’s maths, especially in the construction of Finnegans Wake. I’m thinking of a study by physicists in Poland some years ago, which analysed sentence-length and other patterns in 100 works of literature. FW was the standout result. The study found that its structures mimicked “purely mathematical multifractals”. By his own estimation at the time he was writing it, Joyce was attempting to square the circle. “I am making an engine with only one wheel,” he told his benefactor Harriet Weaver. “No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I’m driving at, don’t you? […] It’s a wheel ... And it’s all square.” Joyce was of course born in a square, in 1882. But even then, there were complications. The square – Brighton Square in Rathgar – was and remains, notoriously, a triangle. The same Martello tower was the venue on Wednesday for the announcement of a new, marathon Bloomsday event, the first instalment of which will take place on June 14th. No, it’s not a mere reading marathon: there are plenty of those already. This will involve athletic activity, the more enthusiastic participants in which will cover 100km. The goal is to run from Sandycove to Mullingar, a town in which the young Joyce spent a formative summer and which also features in Ulysses. Hardline athletes will leave the Martello tower at 6am on the Saturday in question. But the event is not a race, organisers insist. Nor are most of those taking part are not expected to make the full trek. Other suggested starting points include Maynooth, Enfield and Kinnegad. Even 5km sections of the route are encouraged. The main thing is to get to Mullingar around 5pm, for further fun. The Joycean connection aside, half the point is to celebrate the aforementioned Royal Canal and its Greenway. Hence the “Royal Canal Odyssey”, to give the event its full name. More details are at royalcanalodyssey.ie Getting back to advanced maths, I was briefly alarmed by the subheading on our restaurant review yesterday: “Tucked away above a main street bar, Blackrock gets its Barcelona moment.” The thought of Blackrock being tucked away in the upstairs room of a pub somewhere suggested an experiment by Flann O’Brien’s mad scientist De Selby gone wrong. He was last seen running amok in a neighbouring suburb (The Dalkey Archive, 1964). But his creator was a regular in at least one Blackrock pub, so De Selby could well have been implicated here too. Happily, as the story revealed, Blackrock has not turned into a black hole. It’s only a new restaurant that is tucked away over a bar, not that the entire suburb has collapsed in on itself. This must have been a great relief to all concerned. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Activism OffGuardian Our successor to This Week in the Guardian, This Week in the New Normal is our weekly chart of the progress of autocracy, authoritarianism and economic restructuring around the world. Klaus Schwab, founder and leader of the World Economic Forum, is “beginning the process” of stepping down from his duties as chairman of the board of trustees. This “process” is apparently going to take until at least January 2027, so right there you have to wonder how real any of this is at all. But there is precedent, as this announcement follows on from his resignation as Chief Executive in 2023, a role he was succeeded in by Norwegian politician Børge Brende. Now, while an 87 year old man (allegedly) retiring is not, of itself, newsworthy it does raise interesting questions. Such as “why now?” and “who is replacing him?” As to the former, I would guess it’s because Klaus is now tainted. He is too publicly associated with Covid and the “Great Reset”. His presence immediately turns people off, his ideas are instantly suspected. It’s the same reason you don’t see Bill Gates giving as many interviews as you did during Covid. These are the faces of the New Normal agenda, and as that agenda becomes more covert than overt the people who proudly nailed their colours to its mast need to be pushed aside so the greater work can continue. That’s not to say they are being actually rejected or their ideas repudiated, of course, just that their public association is damaging. In the latter case, one early rumor suggested Tony Blair would be taking the job, but (if my reasoning can be trusted) that was never likely. Replacing Schwab with Blair to reduce bad press is like replacing your toaster with a flamethrower so you don’t burn your muffins. Other potential replacements include the other members of the board – Christine Lagarde of the ECB, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. But they largely have the same issue as Blair – namely, they are creepy and everyone hates them. I would suspect that a good portion of the next 18 months of “stepping down process” will be spent holding auditions for some bland-faced Trudeau-like “nice guy” type who can say all the same things Uncle Klaus used to say, without looking and sounding like a Bond villain. Tariffs and Trump and trade are taking up the headlines right now, with online censorship and Adolescence rushing to fill any gaps. Behind that, the now-familiar strains of music still play on a loop. Digital currency this, Covid that and – among other things – Bird Flu. Mexico’s Health Ministry recorded its first official human case of Bird Flu this week, according to Reuters In India, it’s being reported that a two-year-old child died of bird flu after eating raw chicken. The details are unclear, but on the face of it that story makes no sense. In England, DEFRA have ordered stricter measures be put in place in the north after more cases of H5N1 were allegedly found in wild birds. The Conversation warns that bird flu “could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans”. There’s some background noise building. Just in time for an Easter – or post-Easter – scare maybe? I’m not a monster, screams the headline, but I regret having children: And you know what, fine. Maybe regretting having children doesn’t make you a monster, but writing an article about it that your children will likely one day see, does. But that’s just taking the story at face value. The author is anonymous, the names apparently made up, so maybe the whole thing is just a piece of propaganda attacking the idea of having a family. We’re all more than used to the “free speech is hurting our kids!” argument; there’s always someone somewhere mewling out some variation. This week that someone is Ian Russell, an “online safety campaigner”, and the somewhere is BBC Newsnight: "We cannot keep waiting for change to come." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, says there is a "rising anger" amongst bereaved families and calls for Ofcom to be "less timid".#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/W0B9jgrG6j My favourite bit is the part where he says that OfCom need to be “less timid” about enforcing an act…that only came into force 3 weeks ago. I also like how vague the term “real change” is. Just a little tip: When pundits get vague it’s for one of two reasons. Either they don’t know what they’re talking about, or they know the specifics will make them sound stupid. I’m guessing, in this instance, it’s the second one. All told a pretty hectic week for the new normal crowd, and we didn’t even mention the Colorado Bill that classify misgendering your child as “child abuse” or San Francisco’s “equity-based” speeding tickets, which charge you more (or less) depending on your income.

Title: FDA Approves Neuralink Rival’s Brain Implant
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/17/fda-approves-neuralink-rivals-brain-implant/

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026.

Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/17/power-thirsty-ai-data-centers/
Time Published: 2025-04-17T17:20:01Z

By Paige Gross, Stateline.org The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two. It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today. “Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.” As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information. For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say. “We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.” As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai. To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade. As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year. “And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.” The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively. Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing. Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said. “If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.” Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027. As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges. The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported. Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE. Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills. Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community. “The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said. Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers. But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand. “The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said. The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found. Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said. “The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.” Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January. The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said. “I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.” For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit. Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example. With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high. “We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?” Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center. Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed” large data centers. Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices. “It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’” ©2025 States Newsroom.

Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

This same subjective experience can be elicited by direct electrical stimulation of frontal [2] and parietal areas [3], with subjects reporting the “urge to move” upon stimulation. Further, spiking activity from neurons in frontal cortical areas anticipates the subjective experience of intending actions by up to ~1.5 s [4]. These findings suggest that a frontoparietal circuit initiates movements prior to the agent being aware of this intention [5–10], fueling a long-term debate regarding the nature of free will. However, the neural mechanisms co-occurring with the subjective experience of intending actions remain unknown. The study of the subjective phenomena accompanying motor intention has largely relied on two paradigms based on time perception: the “Libet task” [5] and “Intentional Binding” [11, 12]. In the former, participants self-initiate movements and report the perceived time of their intention while neurophysiological measures are taken. Libet’s seminal observation [5] was that a slow drift of neural ensemble activity, the readiness potential [13], preceded not only the onset of voluntary actions but also the subject’s perceived timing of intention (but see [14,15] for studies questioning the interpretation of these findings and [16] for a recent review highlighting the difficulty in estimating the timing of subjective intention). In the “Intentional Binding” paradigm [11,12], participants perform a simple action leading to an effect on the environment. Then, participants report on the timing of their action or its consequent environmental effect. The seminal observation [11,12] is that voluntary actions (but not involuntary ones) lead to a compression in the perceived timing between actions and effects. Studies employing these paradigms have significantly advanced our understanding of motor intention, and have highlighted a common neural circuitry including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA and SMA proper), and the posterior parietal cortex leading to self-initiated behavior [5,11,12,17–22]. However, these studies have not examined the full intentional chain; from intention to action to effect. Indeed, the voluntary actions in the “Libet Task” omit environmental effects, while “Intentional Binding” invokes intention, but does not measure it (querying action and effect, but paradoxically not intention). More vexingly, there is a dearth of cellular recordings surrounding intentional processes and examining subjective experience—which is only possible in humans. For instance, “Intentional Binding” has never been examined during invasive single-cell recordings in humans. In turn, the relative timing between the subjective experience of intention, action, and effect, and their associated neural activity remains unclear. Finally, most previous work has focused on preparatory or precursor activity in higher-order areas of the frontal motor hierarchy, yet have failed to consider the contribution of primary motor cortex (M1) in the intentional chain. Primary motor cortex is the last cortical node guiding action—what Sherrington [23] called “the final common path”—and the neural node most targeted in building and deploying invasive brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) to restore motor control. Yet, we do not know if and how M1 reflects subjective intention and its temporal binding to other elements of the full intentional chain. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, here we leveraged the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain in an expert intracortical M1 BMI user who is outfitted with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) leading to movements of his own, real body [24–26]. This unique setup allowed us to realize a novel intentional chain paradigm in which we systematically enable or disable each element of the intentional chain while recording neural activity in M1 and collecting subjective reports regarding the perceived timing of intentions, actions, and environmental effects. The participant was a C5/C6 tetraplegic person outfitted with a Utah microelectrode array (96 electrodes) in the hand region of M1 (Fig 1A). He is an expert BMI user [24–26] able to perform dexterous movements with his real forearm/hand given that appropriate NMES is provided based on neural decoding. To this end, prior to each session, the participant was asked to attempt two movements, right hand opening (HO) and closing (HC). From these, a non-linear support vector machine (SVM, [27]) was trained to detect and discriminate between intended movements (evoking HC when requested: 89.2%; evoking HO when requesting HC: 0%; see Methods as well as S1 Fig and its caption for additional detail). During experimental sessions (total of 12 sessions, ~35 hours total), HCs were associated with an environmental effect (i.e., it was an operant action), and the participant was asked to initiate these actions at his own urge. His intention to move was decoded via the BMI system and NMES was used to realize the action. The participant held a ball in his hand, serving as an apparent actuator causing an auditory tone 300 ms after squeezing it, i.e., an effect in the environment. In different blocks of trials, distinct elements of the intentional chain were bypassed by generating an involuntary hand movement via NMES (i.e., absence of intention), by not activating the NMES when an intention was decoded (i.e., absence of action), or by not generating the sound after HC (i.e., absence of effect). During the task, the participant viewed a rendering of a clock with a single hand that would complete a full cycle in 2,560 ms. The clock had ticks spanning from 0 to 60 (overlapping at “noon”) and marked every 5 units (see Fig 1A). After each trial (~2.5–3 s post-movement), the participant was prompted to orally report the timing of a single element of the intentional chain by indicating at which location (i.e., from 0 to 60) was the hand (i.e., red dot in Fig 1A) when he either intended the action, actually moved, or the tone was played. The participant was informed prior to each trial which element of the intention chain he would have to report on upon trial completion. The oral report was noted by a hypothesis-naïve experimenter.

This bias may stem from long-term sensorimotor recalibration due to the participant’s medical condition and/or training with BMI systems, or could be a consequence of the delay between experience and report (although see [28] for a similar effect in healthy humans, and see the Discussion for important considerations regarding the putative generalization of the effects herein reported given the participant’s condition). Importantly, the relative timing between hand movement and the following auditory cue was accurate (median of all possible permutations of differences between action to effect estimates = 257 ms; objective timing difference = 300 ms) and precise (S.E.M = 17 ms), demonstrating that the participant was able to accurately and precisely observe and report the timing of environmental events. The variance associated with repeated queries of the onset of subjective intention was ~1.5× larger (1 S.E.M = 37.2 ms) than when querying phenomena with an overt physical consequence (action, S.E.M = 21.4 ms; effect, S.E.M = 17.2 ms). Under the full intentional chain, when intentions led to actions which in turn led to environmental effects, the participant perceived intention to lead actions by 71ms, and the effects to follow actions by 314 ms (error from objective timing = 14 ms. Fig 1B, Row 1). When removing intention and instead provoking HCs at arbitrary times, actions were perceived to occur much later in time (with intention: −526 ms ± 44 ms relative to the objective time of action; without intention; −355 ms ± 18 ms, p = 9.09 × 10−5, Fig 1B, Row 2). When removing actions by transiently disabling the NMES command, and instead activating the tone at a fixed delay after the decoder reached threshold for motor execution, intention was perceived to occur much earlier in time (with action: −597 ms ± 79 ms; without action: −796 ms ± 129 ms, p = 0.02, Fig 1B, Row 3). In neither manipulation—selectively bypassing intention or action—did the estimated timing of the tone (i.e., effect) change (all p > 0.1). Lastly, eliminating environmental effects from the full intentional chain did not alter the perceived timing of intentions (p = 0.41) or actions (p = 0.07) relative to the full intentional chain (Fig 1B, Row 4). These results show a novel form of intentional binding; a compression in the subjective timing between intention and action. Whereas previous temporal binding was observed for the association between two physical events, actions, and effects [11,12], here we describe a new form of binding between a purely internal phenomena (intentions) and a physical action (see S1 Text for a partial replication of the traditional action-effect binding [11,12]). Intention-action binding could have not been revealed in previous work given that only in a participant with a disconnection between brain and end-effectors can intention and motor output be independently controlled and measured. Multi-unit activity (MUA) was aligned to movement onset, or in the case of movement-absent intentional trials, to when movement onset would have occurred given the BMI decoding. Results demonstrated robust evoked MUA in M1 during intention-only trials (peak ~5–8 Hz occurring ~338 ms prior to movement onset, Fig 2A), as well as during NMES-activated movement (peak ~20 Hz occurring ~373 ms after movement onset, Fig 2B). There was no evoked MUA response to tones (S2A Fig). These results demonstrate that intention (but not auditory tones), even in the absence of overt movement, result on average in evoked neural activity in human M1. These intention-only evoked responses precede action-related activity, and are expectedly smaller than action-related activity. Further, a direct comparison of intended versus unintended actions confirms the presence of a gradual rise in firing rate prior to action initiation when actions were intended (S3 Fig, pink and green). When actions were evoked via NMES in the absence of intention, neural activity on average rose shortly before movement onset, an effect that is due to (1) the autocorrelated nature of biological signals and the fact that M1 fires during movement and (2) the need for convolutions (i.e., akin to low-pass filter) to estimate firing rates from discrete spiking activity. Later, at the level of single units (as opposed to multi-unit activity here), we examine whether this gradual rise in firing rate is observed on single trials, and/or whether it may be better characterized as ‘steps’ in activity, as opposed to ramps (see [29–31] for a broader discussion regarding whether decisions reflect continuous ramps or binary thresholds). For now, these results show dissociable signals in M1 related to intention or action (i.e., evoked activity present in intention-only trials, different timing and magnitude for intention- and motor-evoked responses). (A) MUA evoked during intention-only trials aligned to the time of decoder crossing threshold for movement. (B) MUA evoked during movement-only trials aligned to the time of movement onset. (C) MUA evoked during intention-only trials aligned to the report of subjective onset of intention. (D) MUA evoked during movement-only trials aligned to the report of subjective motor onset. (E) Zoomed-in version (x-axis spanning −200 to 500 ms) of (C) and (D), directly contrasting MUA aligned to subjective experience during intention-only and movement-only trials (“I” and “A”, respectively). (F) MUA during intention-only trials, aligned to the subjective timing of intention (red, same as in C. and E.) and to the timing at which the SVM decoder was first able to reliably detect intentionality (“objective” timing of intention and matching on average the relative subjective delay between intention and actions, black). Shaded areas surrounding the average MUA are 1 S.E.M. The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/.

The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g002 Next, we were interested in the temporal relation between this activity and the subjectively perceived timing of events along the intentional chain—an aim solely possible when recording extra-cellular activity and simultaneously requesting a subject to explicitly report on the timing of intentions, actions, and effects. Thus, we aligned MUA to the subjective timings (i.e., reports) of intentions, actions, or environmental effects. Results showed that averaged MUA largely followed the subjective experience, with the onset of evoked responses (defined as +5 standard deviations from baseline) being evident 14 ms after the subjective timing of intention (Fig 2C) and 7 ms after the subjective timing of action (Fig 2D; see Fig 2E for a zoomed-in version directly comparing intention and action). No responses were found to the subjective timing of environmental effects (S2B Fig). We note that these are relative timings between subjective reports (of intention and action in this case) and the onset of evoked and average firing rates and are (1) just averages and not fully descriptive of individual events (see below), (2) depend on an arbitrary definition of the onset of evoked responses, and (3) are corrupted by sources of uncertainty at different scales (e.g., perception of the dot along the clock, drifts in an internal criterion for what constitutes “the experience of intention”, or Poisson variability of spiking activity, to name just a few). Thus, to ascertain a confidence interval over these temporal relationships, we repeated the above analyses while “perturbing” in time individual trial reports by a random amount (uniform distribution of increasing widths, from 10 ms to 1,000 ms in steps of 10 ms) and ask: when are evoked responses significantly degraded? Our estimate is that evoked responses (both to intention and action) remained robust for temporal perturbations of up to ~120 ms (S4 Fig). Quite uniquely, within this BMI context, we could also determine on a trial-by-trial basis an “objective” timing of intention. We operationalized the latter as the first time point within a trial wherein the BMI decoder surpassed 5 standard deviations above its noise level. Note that this criterion is more liberal than that for motor initiation, and on average precedes motor execution by ~70 ms. This matches the average subjective delay between intention and action during the full intentional chain (Fig 1B, Row 1), but on a trial-by-trial basis differs from the reported—subjective—timing of intentions. Aligning MUA during no-movement trials to both “objective” and “subjective” timing of intention showed that average evoked activity in these trials largely coincided with the subjective report of intending an action (Fig 2F, red), but not with the “objective” timing of this intention (Fig 2F, black), as indexed by the BMI-decoder. This argues that while decoders (either artificial or downstream neural areas) may have access to an anticipatory or preparatory “intention-signal” (e.g., in SMA or ACC; REF 4), the subjective experience of intention largely co-occurs (± ~120 ms) on average with the onset of robust evoked spiking activity in human M1. To examine the average temporal relationship between the subjective experience of intention and population dynamics, we projected spiking activity for all 96 channels onto their first two principal components. This accounted for 81.9% of the total variance. The contrast between conditions differing solely by the presence (versus absence) of intention showed that trajectories in a low dimensional latent space bifurcated (S5A Fig). The distance (Euclidian in 2D) between these conditions gradually grew prior to movement, peaked 300 ms post movement onset, and then precipitously dropped (S5A Fig; see S5B Fig and S5C Fig for the same analyses for trials missing either actions or environmental effects). We further investigated whether population dynamics in M1 reflect subjective experience by testing whether they discriminate between trials matched for the presence of intention, action, and environmental effects, but differing in their subjective temporal onset. The contrast between trials where motor intention was perceived relatively early versus late differed between −1,360 ms and −360 ms post-movement onset (S6A Fig, see S6B Fig and S6C Fig for the same analysis examining timing of actions and effects). Similarly, we examine if and how conditions differing by the presence or absence of a single element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) differed at the level of power spectra in different frequency bands of the local field potential. The presence of intention appeared to be reflected in sustained power in the delta band (0.5–4 Hz) and perhaps more intermittently (or varied across trials) in theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz) bands (S7A Fig). Indeed, while power in these lower frequency bands were present even before movement in conditions with intention, they were only induced after movement when NMES-activated actions were provoked in the absence of intention (S7A Fig, rows 1, 3, and 4 versus 3). Movement was most readily reflected by a transient increase in power in the alpha and lower beta bands (S7A Fig, rows 1, 2, and 4 versus 3). To further quantity these effects (and draw parallel to the decoding used to evoke movements, see below), we trained an SVM classifier ([27], 10-fold cross-validation) to establish the degree of separability between baseline (−2,200 ms to −2,000 ms) and induced power (from −2,000 ms to 2,000 ms post-action, in steps of 100 ms). We then compare this classification accuracy in the full intentional chain relative to conditions lacking a single element (S7B Fig, red = intention; green = action; blue = effect). Results show that conditions differing by the presence versus absence of intention are most separable in lower frequency ranges (delta, theta, alpha) with significant differences across conditions (p < 0.01) emerging as early as 1.09s (delta), 0.98s (theta), and 0.87s (alpha) prior to movement. The peak difference between conditions with and without intention occurs 290 ms and 210 ms prior to movement in the delta and theta bands, and co-occurs with movement onset in the alpha band (S7B Fig). Movement decoding (relative to baseline) is most prominent in alpha and beta bands and peaks after movement onset (~330 ms post-movement for both the alpha and beta bands). Overall, these results demonstrate an interesting dichotomy between linearly and independently averaged spiking activity (MUAs) and population dynamics (PCA or LFP, which by definition incorporate covariance information). While the former largely co-occurs with the subjective onset of intention (Fig 2), the latter (1) index intention up to ~1 s prior to movement, and (2) show strongest correlates of intention within a ~200–300 ms window surrounding movement onset. Importantly, even in low frequencies of the LFP domain (i.e., the slowest evolving dynamics), intention is not evident in M1 as early as it may be detected in ACC, SMA, and pre-SMA ([4], ~1.5 ms prior to movement). Next, we questioned whether well-defined single neurons may track the subjective timing of intentions and actions on a trial-by-trial basis. In a first approximation, we restrict this analysis to the first day of recording to assure that single units would not be included in duplicates (i.e., across sessions). Thus, here we examined 66 well-isolated units (examples shown in Fig 3A). (A) Example units—raster plots and PSTH. Top: The raster plots show every trial as a row and each black dot is a spike.

The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g003 We performed a spike count during the 11,000 ms-period preceding actions. Eight neurons (12% out of 66) showed a significant correlation between their spike counts within this period and the reported perceived timing of intentions (all p < 0.05 see Fig 3B, first and second column). All eight neurons are shown in S8 Fig. We note that Fried and colleagues [4] report ~17% of neurons responding to intention (as opposed to co-varying in time with intention here) in frontal areas, and ~8% in temporal regions [4]. Surprisingly, only a single neuron in the present study showed a correlation between its spike counts during this period and the subjective timing of actions (Fig 3B, third column, r = −0.62, p = 0.01). We did not observe any neuron whose spike count correlated with the perceived timing of environmental effects (see S9 Fig for similar results across different time periods and including neurons recorded in all sessions, not solely the first one). Together, these results suggest that a fraction of single units in M1 may predict the onset of the experience of intention. We also examined if, when, and how rapidly single unit firing rates on individual trials indexed an upcoming “urge to move” (recall, the report of this timing occurs seconds later, at the end of trials). To do so, we fit a logistic function (Eq 1) of the form, to individual trial firing rates as they approach the reported intention-time (see [4] for a similar approach). and are respectively asymptotic firing rates during baseline and at the onset of the subjective experience of intention. and are parameters dictating (1) the location (i.e., time) of the central point of the sigmoidal curve describing firing rates, and (2) the steepness of this function (inversely proportional to ). In other words, dictates when firing rates change with respect to the onset of subjective intention, and dictates how quickly this firing rate changes (e.g., from “ramp-like” for a large to “step-like” for small , see [29–31]). All four parameters were fit to individual units and trials, and we retained 177 trials with > 0.5 (see S10A Fig for example individual trials and average responses from 4 units). On average, these units increased in firing rate 108ms prior to the experience of intention (; see S10B Fig for the full distribution), or approximately 700–800ms after a similar effect occurs in SMA, pre-SMA, and ACC [4]. Similarly, the change in firing rates in M1 are more “step-like” (i.e., smaller ) than what is observed in frontal areas (mean = 23 in M1, and mean = 54 in [4], see S10B Fig for the full distributions). Lastly, we look at the impact of each of the elements of the intentional chain on the behavior of real-time BMI neural decoding. First, we contrasted the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain to conditions missing a single element of the sequence. Fig 4A shows that when actions were intended, there was a gradual rise toward the movement initiation threshold. Inducing a non-intended movement through NMES also affected the BMI classifier, but through a delayed and more abrupt rise toward threshold. These two conditions (i.e., intended versus not) strongly bifurcated 1,100 ms prior to movement (p < 0.01; time of actions at 0 ms), a timing that comfortably precedes the median timing of perceiving intentions during the full intentional chain (−597 ms ± 79 ms relative to A-time). When intention did not lead to action, the decoder rose to threshold normally, but plummeted earlier (p < 0.01, 100 ms post-movement onset, Fig 4B). Lastly, during the condition lacking environmental effects, the decoder was sustained for a longer period (Fig 4C, p < 0.01, 500 post-movement onset). These results suggest that the decoder, and thus population dynamics, (1) can index intention to move and (2) that it is sensitive to all aspects of the intentional chain. (A) Effect of intention. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (“IAE”, black) and a chain without intention (“AE”, red) suggests that intention causes an early and gradual rise toward the movement threshold (y = 0). Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of the subjective timing of intentions (“I-time”). AU refers to “arbitrary units”, given that the decoder output was normalized between −1 and 1, with the movement threshold being zero-crossing. (B) Effect of action. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without action (green) suggests that the decoder output decreases shortly after crossing movement threshold when no motor output occurs. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of action reports. (C) Effect of tone. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without a consequence to movement (blue) suggests that the absence of tone results in a sustained heightened decoder output. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of environmental effects reports. Shaded area around the decoder output is ± 1 S.E.M. All trials are shown in transparent in the background. (D) Decoder performance and perceived time of intention. Trials where the area under the decoder curve (AUC) was high (yellow, meaning the decoder was performed well) resulted in the perceived timing of intention to occur later (closer to action) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange). (E) Decoder performance and perceived time of actions. Trials where the AUC was high (yellow) resulted in the perceived timing of actions to occur earlier (closer to intention) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange). (F) Decoder performance and perceived time of effect. Trials where the AUC was high (yellow) versus low (orange) resulted in similar perceived timing of the tone. The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. (A) Effect of intention. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (“IAE”, black) and a chain without intention (“AE”, red) suggests that intention causes an early and gradual rise toward the movement threshold (y = 0). Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of the subjective timing of intentions (“I-time”). AU refers to “arbitrary units”, given that the decoder output was normalized between −1 and 1, with the movement threshold being zero-crossing. (B) Effect of action. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without action (green) suggests that the decoder output decreases shortly after crossing movement threshold when no motor output occurs. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of action reports. (C) Effect of tone. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without a consequence to movement (blue) suggests that the absence of tone results in a sustained heightened decoder output. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of environmental effects reports. Shaded area around the decoder output is ± 1 S.E.M. All trials are shown in transparent in the background. (D) Decoder performance and perceived time of intention. Trials where the area under the decoder curve (AUC) was high (yellow, meaning the decoder was performed well) resulted in the perceived timing of intention to occur later (closer to action) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange). (E) Decoder performance and perceived time of actions. Trials where the AUC was high (yellow) resulted in the perceived timing of actions to occur earlier (closer to intention) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange). (F) Decoder performance and perceived time of effect. Trials where the AUC was high (yellow) versus low (orange) resulted in similar perceived timing of the tone. The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g004 Next, we questioned whether performance of the decoder may reflect intention-action binding (see Fig 1). As a measure of decoder performance, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of the decoder, as this measure collapses performance over time, and thus reduces the total number of potential comparisons (e.g., decoder performance at each time point versus behavior). This curve is also normalized between −1 and 1 (Fig 4A–4C), hence controlling for potential spurious effects that could be caused by variations in raw decoder performance across sessions and days. We coalesced all trials of a particular judgment type (i.e., reports on intention, action, or environmental effect). Then, we computed the AUC of the decoder for each trial and kept the top (high; yellow) and bottom (low; orange) third of trials defined by AUC. Examining the participant’s reports—sorted by AUC of the decoder and independently from behavior—showed that in trials with high AUC (yellow), intention was perceived as occurring later than on trials with low AUC (orange, Fig 2D, p = 3.77 × 10−4). Applying the same approach to judgments regarding the timing of actions, we found the opposite pattern: actions were perceived as occurring earlier (Fig 2E, p = 0.01) in high (yellow) versus low (orange) AUC trials. In other words, on trials where the BMI decoder more reliably evoked the intended movement (i.e., HC, higher AUC), there was mutual attractive pull between intentions and actions. The perceived timing of effects was not modulated by AUC of the decoder (Fig 2F, p = 0.22, see S1 Text and S11 Fig for a further control). Together, these results suggest that M1 population dynamics, as indexed by the multivariate decoder the participant uses to move, reflects intention-action temporal binding. In turn, the behavioral results (Fig 1B) argued that actions within a full intentional chain result in a perceived temporal binding between intentions and actions. We leveraged the unique opportunity to selectively bypass intentions, actions, or the corollary consequences of these actions in a tetraplegic person fitted with an intracortical M1 implant and NMES leading to movements of his own body. This allowed us to index for the first time the perceived temporal binding between all elements of the intentional chain while simultaneously performing extra-cellular recordings in a human. Further, it allowed us to fill a critical gap in knowledge: while prior seminal work indexed the temporal relation between the onset of intention and spiking activity in pre-motor [4] or parietal regions, the temporal relation between M1 spiking activity and the subjective onset of intention remained unknown. Behavioral results demonstrated a novel form of intentional binding, not between actions and effects [11,12], but between intentions and actions. The time distortions caused by intention-action binding are stronger than those engendered by action-effect binding, which likely reflects long-term and permanent associations between intending and performing an action, in contrast to the more sporadic association between actions and a specific auditory consequence (see S1 Text). Importantly, it must also be noted that this intention-action binding may be amplified in the current participant by virtue of the BMI-based control of actions. Hence, it will be important to confirm these behavioral results in neurotypical subjects employing non-invasive BMIs. Neurally, results demonstrate that unit and population-level dynamics in M1 index the presence of intention. Further, spiking activity largely co-occur (on average, with an acknowledged degree of uncertainty) with the onset of the subjective experience of intention, and spike counts of subset of the population may co-vary with the onset of the subjective experience of intention on a trial-by-trial basis. Population dynamics (which by definition index a large ensemble of units and may also be detected by non-invasive methods) show a looser temporal association between neural activity and the subjective onset of intention. That M1 reflects intention is implied by earlier work [24–26] demonstrating the ability to detect motor intention in this area. It is also perhaps not surprising, given that M1 is the final central nervous system node in the motor pathway [23]. In contrast, the determination of the temporal relationship between the onset of intention and evoked activity in M1 is a novel and important one, particularly in the context of prior work. Namely, Fried and colleagues [4] showed that neurons in the pre-SMA, SMA, and ACC all anticipate the subjective timing of intention by about 700–1,500 ms. Here, we close a critical gap in knowledge by recording from M1, an area downstream from those previously probed in humans. We show that evoked multi-unit spiking activity in M1 on average largely co-occurs with (± ~120 ms) and does not precede (as in pre-SMA, SMA, and ACC) the experience of intention. The fact that there are direct synaptic connections between pre-SMA/SMA and M1, and yet their relation to the onset of subjective intention differs by ~700–1,500 ms implies that the subjective experience of intention may be mechanistically engendered by a relatively slow accumulation process. Indeed, in this line, it has recently been shown that a fraction of neurons across the entire brain accumulate evidence toward a decision/action on a relatively slow temporal scale and that this accumulation occurs in a “movement-null” subspace [32]. Then, almost instantaneously this neural activity is projected onto a “movement-potent” subspace, enacting movement [32] (also see [33,34]). Putatively, may explain why we may accumulate evidence without causing movement, why there is a fairly large delay between intention-related signals in pre-SMA/SMA/ACC and M1, and why the temporal relation between the onset of subjective experience and neural activity in M1 may differ between evoked MUAs (i.e., perhaps a movement-potent subspace) and higher-dimensional population dynamics (i.e., perhaps a movement-null subspace). The speculation is that the experience of intention may co-occur with a re-formatting of neural activity in M1; from a movement-null to a movement-potent subspace. This speculation is in line with our findings suggesting that while (multivariate) signals related to intention may be present (i.e., are decodable, Fig 4) in M1 and elsewhere [9,24–26,35–41] well before the onset of the subjective experience of intention, this latter one largely coincides with evoked MUA activity in M1. This observation, along with our emphasis on relating neural activity with the subjective onset of intentionality, breaks with the dominant effort to ascribe intention at ever-earlier stages of the cortical action hierarchy [42–45]. We do not claim that intention does not originate at earlier nodes—it undoubtedly does—nor we claim that M1 is the necessary and sufficient area for intention. We simply note that the subjective experience of intending an action seemingly largely co-occurs with evoked activity in M1, while it tends to follow neural activity in other pre-motor and parietal areas. In the present study, we could not record from other important sites for intention, such as anterior cingulate, supplementary motor areas, pre-motor, or parietal cortex, as electrodes placement is dictated by clinical and not experimental purposes. Multisite implants or integration of results from multiple patients with electrodes in other sites may contribute to gather a more comprehensive view. It must also be explicitly stated that our findings are correlational in nature. In future experiments, it will be interesting to attempt direct, causal perturbations approaches (such as stimulation, as in [2,3]). These perturbation approaches will likely be most informative with concurrent recordings, such that we may estimate if perturbations are “on-manifold”, or orthogonal to subspaces that eventually lead to movement. Likewise, we must also explicitly acknowledge the temporal uncertainty that exists with reporting the onset of any subjective experience, and in particular the experience of “an urge to move” [16]. Lastly, we must emphasize that the observations we report herein are from a single tetraplegic patient and a skilled BMI user who may have experienced a large degree of neuroplasticity, learning, and sensorimotor adaptations. That these important biological mechanisms are likely at play in the current patient is highlighted by the fact that he shows a large bias in the temporal perception of his actions. However, we must also note that in the current setting, a large delay between “objective” and “subjective” estimates of elements within the intentional chain may have aided in establishing neural correlates of the subjective experience of intention. Indeed, intention is typically too tightly linked to the true onsets of motor actions, thus challenging the parsing of motor intention from motor acts in normal conditions. For now, we must emphasize that it will be critical for future work—including work employing more causal manipulations—to ratify (or not) the current observations, and highlight that there is prior work (albeit of more indirect nature, such as employing scalp electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or work in patients with widespread lesions) both supporting [46] and questioning [47,48] the role of M1 in motor intentions. We must also highlight a recent report [49] demonstrating the generalizability of findings from the current patient to a wider healthy population undergoing scalp EEG. In conclusion, we show a novel form of temporal binding between the perceived time of intentions and actions and demonstrate that M1 evoked activity (i.e., a linear operation) largely coincides in time (± ~120 ms) with the onset of the subjective experience of intention, may predict trial-to-trial fluctuations in this onset, and reflects perceived intention-action binding. Instead, population dynamics in M1 show a looser association with the subjective onset of intention, preceding the subjective experience by 200–300 ms, but not 700–1,500 ms, as in ACC, pre-SMA, and SMA [4]. Together, these results close a critical gap in our knowledge describing the temporal relationship between neural activity in M1 and the onset of intention. Approval for this study was obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption) and The Ohio State University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (2013H0164). The study met institutional requirements for the conduct of human subjects and was registered on the http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov website (identifier NCT01997125). The participant referenced in this work completed an oral and written informed consent process before taking part in the study. He also provided written permission for photographs and video. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The participant was a 27-year-old male with stable, non-spastic C5/C6 quadriplegia from a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) sustained 8 years prior to the current experiment. The participant’s International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI neurologic level is C5 (motor complete) with a zone of partial preservation to C6 [50]. He is an expert BMI user, with over 5 years of usage [24]. The subject has full range of motion in bilateral shoulders, full bilateral elbow flexion, a twitch of wrist extension, and no motor function below the level of C6. His sensory level is C5 on the right (due to altered but present light touch on his thumb) and C6 on the left. He has intact proprioception in the right upper limb and the shoulder for internal rotation through external rotation, at the forearm for pronation through supination, and at the wrist for flexion through extension. Proprioception for right digit flexion through extension at the metacarpal-phalangeal joints was impaired for all digits. The patient underwent a left frontoparietal craniotomy for implantation of a Utah microelectrode array (Blackrock Microsystems Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah) in the (dominant) hand region of primary motor cortex. This region was identified via pre-operative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging where the patient was asked to imagine performing hand movements (Fig 1). The area was targeted via an intraoperative navigation system (see [24] for details). The array contained 96 channels (4.4 mm × 4.2 mm × 1.5 mm in depth) and was implanted into the cortex using a pneumatic inserter. Reference wires were placed subdurally. Neural data were sampled at 30 kHz and hardware band-pass filtered between 0.3 Hz and 7.5kHz (3rd order Butterworth). Once digitized, the data were transmitted to a central computer running MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), where signal artifacts due to NMES were removed by blanking over 3.5 ms around the artifact (defined as signal amplitude >500 μV simultaneously in at least 4 of 12 randomly selected channels). A non-linear SVM was used to translate neural activity to intended hand movements. The inputs to the SVM were mean wavelet power (MWP) over 100 ms bins. That is, neural activity was decomposed into 11 wavelet scales (Daubechies wavelet, MATLAB), and the coefficient of wavelets 3–6, corresponding to the multi-unit frequency band spanning from 235 to 3.75 kHz, were then normalized and averaged within 100 ms bins resulting in 96 values, one for each channel. The processed features (i.e., mean wavelet values) were then used as input to a support vector machine algorithm that used sparsity optimization to improve decoder accuracy by zeroing out the least valuable MWP features. Training data for the decoder were obtained by prompting the participant at the beginning of each recording session to imagine performing one of two specific hand movement; HO or HC using an animated virtual hand displayed on a computer monitor. The subject performed seven blocks of classifier training (five repetitions per hand movement type) prior to starting the main experiments (S1 Fig). Training took approximately 10 min per session. Two decoders were built (HO versus rest and HC versus rest), and output classes were computed for each movement that had scores ranging from −1 to 1 (arbitrary units). A score of −1 indicated that the classifier estimated the subject to be at rest, a score of 1 indicated that the classifier estimated the participant to perform an action (see [24–26] for additional detail). During experimental sessions, only HC were used (i.e., operant movement resulting in a consequence in the environment), but two movements were trained during decoding to assure detection and discrimination of intention. The appropriate NMES (see below) became active when the output score for a given movement crossed zero (threshold crossing). A NMES system was used to evoke hand movement by stimulating forearm muscles. The NMES system consisted of a multi-channel stimulator and a flexible, 130-electrode, circumferential forearm sleeve. The coated copper electrodes were 12 mm in diameter, spaced at regular intervals in an array (22 mm longitudinally × 15 mm transversely), and delivered current in monophasic, rectangular pulses at 50 Hz (pulse width 500 μs, amplitude 0–20 mA). Desired hand movements were calibrated at the beginning of each session by determining/confirming the intensity and pattern of electrodes required to stimulate intended movements. This procedure took approximately 5–10 min per session. From a baseline rest position the subject was asked to perform two movements, right HO and HC. Hand closing resulted in an auditory tone being played 300 ms after movement onset (or the decoder surpassing movement threshold, see above). The analyses in the current report focus on HC trials, as these were associated with consequences in the external environment (i.e., the tone), and thus had all components of a full intentional chain. While performing these movements, the subject observed the rendering of a clock with a single hand that would complete a full cycle in 2,560 ms [5]. The initial position of the clock hand was random on each trial. Over the course of 12 separate sessions (~2–4 hours/session, including setup) the participant completed five different experiments, containing variations where he reported either the time of intention onset, the time of action onset, or the time of sound onset. In the first experiment, on different blocks, we randomly activated the NMES resulting in HC, or we presented the tone at a random time without NMES (50 repetitions per condition). This experiment was a baseline experiment to assess the subject’s temporal perception of movement and auditory stimuli in the absence of any causal structure (i.e., no intention to move, nor a movement causing the effect in the external environment). The second experiment was the “full intentional chain” where intention resulted in movement, and a particular movement (HC, but not HO) resulted in a tone being played. On different trials, the subject reported the timing either of his intention, movement onset, or tone onset (50 repetitions per condition). The third experiment broke the expectation that HC results in an external consequence, and on different trials the subject was asked to report the timing of his intention to move or actual movement (50 repetitions per condition). In the fourth experiment, the subject was instructed not to imagine moving, and instead at a random time, we activated the NMES resulting in HC. Thus, in this experiment there was movement and an effect to this movement, but no intention. On different trials, the participant indicated either movement or tone onset (50 repetitions per condition). Lastly, and quite uniquely given the experimental setup (BMI coupled with NMES), in the fifth experiment, the subject intended to move, and this resulted in the decoder crossing the threshold that would ultimately evoke a consequence, the tone, but no movement. On different trials, we asked the subject to report either when he first intended to move, or the time of sound onset (50 repetitions per condition). Report type (intention, action, effect) was varied in “mini-runs” of 5 trials, and a full experiment was not run in 1 session, but instead experiments were intermixed between sessions. Behavioral estimates of each judgment type (intention, action, effect) and different combinations of elements of the intentional chain (Fig 1B, different rows) were coalesced and their circular median was computed. Targeted non-parametric statistics were conducted, as reported in the main text. Regarding single-unit spiking activity, data files were concatenated across an entire session, filtered with a 300 Hz–30 kHz bandpass filter, and spike sorted via WaveClust [50] in MATLAB. Clusters were then manually inspected for waveform shape and violation of the inter-spike interval. Spikes were binned in 1ms intervals and then spike counts were performed. Correlations with the subjective timing of intention, actions, and effects were computed by Pearson correlation. For firing rate plots in Fig 3A, binned spikes were convolved with a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 50 ms. Only units from the first session were kept for the main analyses in main text, to avoid observing units in duplicate. Multi-unit spiking activity from all 96 recording channels was separated as a function of judgment type and the different combinations of the intentional chain. Spikes were then convolved with a Gaussian distribution (50 ms standard deviation). We summarized this activity by averaging each channel across trials. The onset of evoked MUA was defined as the signal being five times the noise level (standard deviation). To account for spiking activity of the population of neurons as a whole, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the average firing rate for each condition. We kept the two components that explained the most variance. For statistical analyses, we re-sampled trials (with replacement) 1,000 times, before conducting PCA, and determined the 95% confidence intervals. Power within different frequency bands of the local field potential was determined by wavelet decomposition, and further quantitative analyses of evoked power relative to baseline were computed by SVM (10-fold cross-validated). Lastly, regarding the neural decoder analyses, the outputs of the decoder were amalgamated as a function of judgment type and different combinations of the intentional chain. Statistical contrasts as specified in the main text were conducted via time-resolved unpaired t-tests corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). Evoking hand closure (HC) via M1 decoder. The BMI user was asked to perform HC movements in a self-paced manner, but only during specific intervals (each internal being ~11 s long). These intervals are marked by the red curve being equal to 1. The decoder output spanned between −1 and 1, and would cause movement via NMES upon zero-crossing. Trials were performed in short blocks of five trials, and the figure shows five example blocks of five trials. Decoder output is represented in black. As indicated in the main text, during the course of the entire experiment (12 sessions of ~3–4 hours/session), the user was able to produce HC on 89.2% of requests. On no occasion (0%) was a second action, hand-opening, produced when requesting a HC. However, on occasions, there would be an HC (caused by decoder zero-crossing) without such an explicit request. To estimate the frequency of this occurrence in analyses, we randomly shifted the periods in which a given HC was requested, and estimated how frequently HC occurred during these surrogates. They occurred on 8.1% of surrogate “trials.” Of note, we cannot ascertain whether the participant self-initiated the intention for HC during these periods, even though it was not explicitly requested.

In this manner, we ask: by how much can we perturb/move reported timings without degrading the evoked response to the subjective timing of intention/action. For statistical contrasts, we conclude a response has been degraded once at least 10 time points are different from the original at p < 0.01. Acknowledgedly, this is an arbitrary threshold. This statistical threshold is met once timings are perturbed within a ~120 ms window (i.e., −120 ms to +120 ms) surrounding the reported timings of intention and action.

(B) Difference in SVM decodability (induced power versus baseline) as a function of whether intention (red), action (green), or effect (blue) was missing from the full intentional chain. The absence of intention is most evident in lower frequency bands and occurs prior to movement onset, and peaks close to movement onset (particularly in the alpha band). The absence of action is most evident in alpha and beta bands, is more transient in nature, and occurs post-movement.

Results demonstrate a clear over-representation of neurons correlating with the subjective timing of intentions rather than actions or effects. This effect is sustained from ~−2,000 ms to 0 ms post-movement onset. After the movement, no estimate (intention, action, or effect) more frequently correlated with single-unit spiking activity.

Top: their average response (black) and logistic fit (red) of this response, as we approach the timing of the reported “urge to move.” Below each average response, example trials from each of the units. These show two broad classes. The first two columns show examples where the averaging of variable timing “step-like” behavior on individual trials results in an average “ramp-like” behavior. The second two example units (columns 3 and 4) show examples where a robust response only exists in a subset of trials (second row), also yielding an average “ramp-like” behavior. (B) The average response of single units (top, black, n = 34) and individual trials from these units (bottom, red, n = 177) were fit to sigmoidal functions (units and trials are kept if r2 > 0.5). The histograms show the full distributions of estimated t0 values (left) indicating when the step occurs (relative to the reported time of the subjective experience of intention), and alpha parameters (right), which is inversely proportional to how “step-like” the sigmoidal functions are.

Stellar, a superfast and low fee-public blockchain, says it plans to hold $3 billion in real-world asset (RWA) value and power $110 billion in RWA volume by the end of 2025. The goal set by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the nonprofit that supports the development and growth of the Stellar network, is building on existing partnerships with the likes of Franklin Templeton and Wisdom Tree. In addition, Stellar is welcoming a new round of tokenization specialists such as Paxos, Ondo, Etherfuse and SG Forge, the blockchain innovation division of French bank Société Générale. “We have a goal of powering $3 billion in real-world asset value on Stellar in 2025,” Lauren Thorbjornsen, VP and chief of staff at Stellar Development Foundation, said in an interview. “That would be more than a 10x increase from the $290 million in RWA we had in Stellar at the end of December 2024. But already we see a lot of growth happening on the network, just in the first quarter of this year.” Tokenizing a range of existing financial assets has become all the rage among traditional finance firms over the past year or so, with major companies including BlackRock entering the space. Stellar, established in 2014 by former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb, is designed to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies or assets.

CSGR Research Fellow, University of Warwick Johannes Petry receives funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the German Research Foundation (DFG). University of Warwick provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners The trade war between China and the US has spiralled into unchartered territory. On April 10, the Trump administration imposed a tariff of 125% on all Chinese imports. China called the actions unfair and responded with similar measures. Within the broader debate around unravelling economic ties between the US and China, where economic interdependence has increasingly been viewed as a threat to US national security, this escalation raises questions about whether global finance is also reducing its presence in China. After all, the risks of financial connectivity with China have been discussed prominently by US policymakers in recent years. And many financial analysts have spent much of the past year discussing whether China has become “uninvestable” due to rising geopolitical tensions. However, as I show in a recently published study, most global financial firms have continued to expand their presence in Chinese markets over the last decade, even as tensions have intensified. Crucially, they have done so on China’s terms, operating within a system that prioritises government oversight and policy goals over liberal market norms. This pragmatic accommodation is quietly reshaping the global financial order. China’s capital markets, which have historically been sealed off from the rest of the world, have been opening up in recent decades. This has prompted global financial firms to expand their footprint in China. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have taken full ownership of local joint ventures. And asset managers like BlackRock or Invesco have established fund management operations on the Chinese mainland. Yet China has not liberalised in the way many in the west expected. Rather than conforming to global norms of open, lightly regulated markets, China’s financial system remains largely guided by the state. Markets there operate within a framework shaped by the policy priorities of the central government, capital controls remain in place, and foreign firms are expected to play by a different set of rules than they would in New York or London. Foreign investors have been allowed to buy into mainland markets, but through infrastructure that limits capital outflows and preserves regulatory oversight. Rather than adapting China to the global financial order, Wall Street has accommodated China’s distinct model. The motivation behind this is clear: China is simply too big to ignore. Take China’s pension system as an example. Whereas pension assets in the US amount to 136.2% of GDP in 2019, in China these only amounted to 1.6%. The growth potential in this market is enormous, representing a trillion-dollar opportunity for global firms. Consequently, index providers such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, and S&P Dow Jones – key gatekeepers of global investment – have included Chinese stocks and bonds in major benchmark indices. These decisions, taken between 2017 and 2020, effectively declared Chinese markets “investment grade” for institutional investors around the world. This has helped legitimise China’s market model within the architecture of global finance. In recent years, Washington has sought to curtail US financial exposure to China through a growing set of measures. These include investment restrictions, entity blacklists, and forced delisting for Chinese firms on US stock exchanges. Such actions signal a broader effort to use finance as a tool of strategic leverage. The moves have had some effect. Some US institutional investors and pension funds have declared China “uninvestable”, and are reducing their exposure. American investments in China have roughly halved since their US$1.4 trillion (£1.1 trillion) peak in 2020. But attributing this solely to geopolitical pressure overlooks another key factor: China’s underwhelming market performance. A protracted property crisis, a government crackdown on tech companies, and a weak post-pandemic economic recovery have made Chinese markets less attractive to investors in purely financial terms. More strategically oriented investors from Asia, Europe and the Middle East have invested more into Chinese markets, filling gaps left by US investors. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, especially, have engaged in more long-term investments as part of broader efforts to strengthen economic cooperation with China. And at the same time, many western financial firms have doubled down on their presence in China, expanding their onshore footprint. Since 2020, institutions like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have opened new offices, increased their staff, acquired new licences and bought out their joint venture partners to operate independently as investment banks, asset managers or futures brokers. It has become more difficult to invest foreign capital in China. But western financial firms are positioning themselves to tap into China’s huge domestic capital pools and capture its long-term growth opportunities – even as they tread carefully around geopolitical sensitivities. It is too early to predict the long-term effects of the current geopolitical tensions. But Wall Street is trying to placate both sides. On the one hand, it is adapting to capital markets with Chinese characteristics. And on the other, it is trying not to antagonise an increasingly interventionist America. However, while holding its breath amid further escalation and having scaled back some of its activities, Wall Street has not left China. It is instead learning how to work within the constraints of a system shaped by a different set of priorities. This does not necessarily signal a new global consensus. But it does suggest that the liberal financial order, once defined by Anglo-American norms, is becoming more pluralistic. China’s rise is showing that alternative models – where the state retains a strong hand in markets – can coexist with, and even shape, global finance. As tensions between the US and China continue to rise, financial firms are learning to navigate a world in which existing relationships between states and markets are being reconfigured. This process may well define the future of global finance. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 202,200 academics and researchers from 5,174 institutions.
