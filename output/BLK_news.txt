The Avalanche Foundation announced raising $250 million through a private token sale to support its blockchain platform, according to a Dec. 12 statement. The funding round had around 40 participants, including leading firms such as Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital. The announcement spurred a 10% surge in Avalanche’s AVAX token, pushing its price to $52. This continues a bullish trend, with the token gaining 52% over the past month. The Avalanche9000 upgrade, set for Dec. 16, aims to revolutionize blockchain costs and scalability. It will cut Layer-1 deployment costs on Avalanche by 99.9% and lower transaction fees on its C-Chain by 25 times. The upgrade supports Avalanche’s multi-chain vision, enabling horizontal scalability across various industries such as gaming, payments, loyalty programs, and real-world asset tokenization. Over 500 Layer-1 chains are in development, and institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leveraging Avalanche for their tokenized funds. Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, called the upgrade a transformative moment for blockchain development. He stated: “Avalanche’s upcoming Avalanche9000 upgrade represents a pivotal step toward advancing the decentralized finance ecosystem, and we believe Avalanche is uniquely positioned to capture the growing momentum in Web3 and blockchain scalability.” In preparation, the Avalanche9000 testnet introduced Retro9000, which includes a $40 million retroactive grant program. This initiative offers $2 million in referral rewards to developers building on the platform. Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder of Ava Labs, highlighted the network’s potential to outpace Ethereum, Solana, and other chains combined in transaction volume, emphasizing Avalanche’s unique multi-chain model. He stated: “There is no question in my mind that Avalanche network will process more transactions than Ethereum/L2s + Solana + other chains combined in the near future. There’s no Avalanche ‘chain.’ It’s a network of many interoperable chains. In aggregate there’s going to be a lot of activity.” At the time of press 12:55 am UTC on Dec. 13, 2024, Avalanche is ranked #11 by market cap and the price is up 9.39% over the past 24 hours.

Real-world asset tokenization firm Securitize appointed Michael Sonnenshein, formerly CEO of asset management company Grayscale Investments, as chief operating officer. "There is massive demand for tokenization, and I am thrilled to join Securitize at such a pivotal moment for the company and the industry," Sonnenshein said in a Thursday statement. His appointment started on Dec. 9. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The process involves representing financial instruments like bonds, credit, commodities and other real-world assets on the blockchain in pursuit of operational efficiency, speedier settlements and cheaper transactions. Securitize is a key service provider and marketplace in the field, with over $1 billion worth of tokenized instruments on its platform. The company jointly manages asset management behemoth BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. BlackRock also invested in Securitize. "Michael is a trailblazer whose strategic vision and ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes have helped pave the way for establishing digital assets as a mainstream investment class," Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, said in a statement. Sonnenshein's appointment followed his departure earlier this year from Grayscale, where he had served as CEO since 2021. During his tenure, the company was one of the firms to have a spot-based bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. Grayscale had taken the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator's repeated refusal to allow it to convert its flagship, closed-end fund Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. Sonnenshein also joined Aptos Labs, developer organization of layer-1 blockchain Aptos (APT), as an adviser last month. Krisztian Sandor recently graduated from NYU's business and economic reporter program as a Fulbright fellow and worked with Reuters and Forbes previously. Originally from Budapest, Hungary, he is now based in New York. He holds BTC and ETH. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

Title: Fartcoin Stuns The World With A $500 Million Market Cap: “Nobody Ever Went Broke Overestimating The Flatulence Of The American Public”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a quintessential memecoin with no utility whatsoever, has stunned the world by claiming a market-based capitalization in excess of $500 million. This development is all the more striking when one considers the well-founded hypothesis that the current memecoin season is still in its infancy, with much more insanity presumably in the offing. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Fartcoin does not lay claim to any intrinsic value. Instead, the memecoin draws the entirety of its worth from a vibrant community devoted to sharing flatulence-related jokes and memes. Even so, literally no one expected the memecoin to eclipse a $500 million market-based capitalization. BREAKING: Fartcoin's market cap is now greater than 38% of all American publicly-traded companies. pic.twitter.com/obLQK8LNTe — Hedgeye (@Hedgeye) December 12, 2024 For context, consider the fact that Fartcoin is now more valuable than a stunning 38 percent of all publicly-traded American companies! “Nobody ever went broke overestimating the flatulence of the American public.” - H.L. Mencken https://t.co/Dbkxz1Jxmx — Clifford Asness (@CliffordAsness) December 12, 2024 This development has predictably spawned a ton of humorous takes, including a play on H.L. Mencken's quote: Of course, as per historical precedents, the memecoin season is still in its infancy. In the previous crypto bull cycles, Bitcoin typically took the initial lead, followed by Ethereum's Ether, and then the memecoins started recording rip-roaring gains, capping off the peak mania phase of the cycle. Currently, however, Bitcoin is still in its lead phase, which lends credence to the hypothesis that the market will likely see many iterations of Fartcoin before the present cycle ends. Most coins are about a 2-3x away from former ATH Do with that information what you will $FTM $FET pic.twitter.com/r72c21nWFH — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2024 Consider the fact that many altcoins are still quite far away from their all-time highs recorded in the previous bull cycle. When the 6-month and below #Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves bands surpass ~80%, it's a good indication the market is over-heated, and a major price peak is likely... 🔥 Currently we're at around 55%, plenty of upside to go for #BTC!👆 pic.twitter.com/ZL5P7USMo9 — Bitcoin Magazine Pro (@BitcoinMagPro) December 12, 2024 And, as per Bitcoin's Realized Cap HODL Waves bands, the world's preeminent cryptocurrency still has room to run. New report from BlackRock today that recommends 1-2% exposure to Bitcoin ETF, first time they gave specific number (they put this out bc they had so much incoming on this q of how much?). pic.twitter.com/X7iF06xXFa — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 Interestingly, BlackRock provided another bullish jolt to Bitcoin today by formally recommending a portfolio allocation of 1 to 2 percent to spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the meantime, Fartcoin can feasibly clock-in additional gains. Just don't expect those gains to last. Consider the recent pump-and-dump in the Hawk Tuah memecoin as a cautionary reference point.

Title: Private credit firms are hot acquisition targets. As M&A ramps up next year, here are the firms likely to be bought.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/private-market-asset-management-deal-outlook-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-12T15:10:34Z

The trend in asset management is pretty clear — private markets are the new black. "If you're not in private markets or private credit, you'll need to move in that direction, or you'll get left behind," PwC financial services deal leader Greg McGahan told Business Insider. Asset managers who have traditionally relied on ETFs and mutual funds to make money are itching to expand into alternative assets to diversify their offerings and boost fee revenue, a new PwC report said. That demand and expectations that interest rates will continue to drop and incoming light-touch regulators mean asset managers are ready to dust off their dealmaking playbooks. Private credit firms specifically are in demand, as shown by the blockbuster BlackRock deal announced last week. The asset management giant agreed to buy the private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. And it's not just the traditional money managers. Private equity firms are also using acquisitions to strengthen their private credit capabilities and market presence. PwC sees increasing competition in private credit contributing to the consolidation of alternative asset managers. McGahan said private credit firms with between $30 billion and $70 billion in assets under management will be the ones to watch. They will either need to make a deal to grow bigger or be snapped up themselves. "Those types of shops potentially could be absorbed into other shops that are looking to grow their portfolios," he said. "It's either acquire or be acquired." Deals in alternatives will also be driven by aging founders in the private markets space who are trying to figure out succession planning and capitalizing on the ability to monetize their investments. For his part, McGahan is seeing his deals practice's work ticking up and "getting up to full capacity. We'll be at supersaturation levels pretty shortly. So, I think you're seeing that pent-up demand now manifest itself." While the marriage of firms operating in one investing discipline with another makes sense for diversification reasons, the actual integration of the two could be trickier. Culture and compensation are very different between traditional firms and alternatives. A portfolio manager at a publicly traded mutual fund might receive cash compensation and equity stakes. If you're a private equity manager, you're paid with carried interest, or a percentage of profits generated from the firm's investments. "Could you have within a large traditional manager basically an alternative platform where the PMs are earning multiples of the existing PMs on the traditional side? That's going to be a cultural challenge,' McGahan said. He added there are also operational differences and gave the example of a private credit firm using treasury functions daily versus a private equity firm that uses a couple times a month. The question of cultural fit is top of mind at BlackRock when the asset manager makes acquisitions, according to the firm's CFO Martin Small. BlackRock has made several high-profile acquisitions this year, snapping up Global Infrastructure Partners in January in addition to HPS. Small, who was part of many meetings with HPS's executive team to test the waters, said the cofounders shared important values with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and firm president Rob Kapito. "We all speak the same language," Small said at the Goldman Sachs Financial Conference in New York. "They're founders. Larry Fink and Rob Kapito are founders. We're client-centered firms. We believe in scale, we believe in global." Integrating two firms successfully requires lots of important — if technical— work behind the scenes, Small added. "People, platform, process — think about all the pedestrian things of the employee experience. You've got to be on the same email system, you've got to make sure people's laptops work, you've got to make their key cards work at the door, " he said. "All of that's done so we can just get to business on realizing the synergies and delivering for clients. Jump to

Title: Is Target Corp (TGT) the Best Department Store Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) stands against the other best department store stocks to buy now. The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren't all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn't so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. She said the trends in the sector are changing, with around 75% of shopping journeys starting online at the outset. Although some of them end up with consumers paying visits to the brick-and-mortar stores, much of the shopping journeys end with sales happening online. Furthermore, the retail sector is showing consumer behavior that tends to undertake a multiple retailer journey these days. If it is a bigger purchase, most consumers prefer checking out four to five retailers, either online or offline. This poses a significant change in the sector as compared to around two decades ago. Moulton said that consumers have consistently shown the industry in many ways that they are experiencing the effects of the cost of living crisis. However, recent survey data by McKinsey shows that consumers have started to feel more confident, which is expected to be reflected in the busier Christmas period this year compared to the last couple of years. She is optimistic about the future, saying that although we are still in a tricky place, there is light at the end of the tunnel. McKinsey's estimates show that around 63% of consumers are expected to have an increased e-commerce spending forecast this holiday shopping season. The e-commerce spending forecast for around 27% of consumers is expected to remain the same, while it may decrease for 4% due to cutbacks. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are increasingly becoming more significant in the holiday shopping season, especially compared to Christmas shopping. Mouton said that the retail industry is seeing more and more concentration of sales in the days around Black Friday. That is tough for retailers, as it puts a significant amount of weight on the fairly narrow set of items that retailers work hard to put great deals against. The retail results for the 29th November weekend mark the culmination of nine months of work by most retailers. This includes sourcing good value, marketing their items, watching the trends in the days before the weekend itself, detecting the items getting more traffic, and more. Since the changing trends keep concentrating more and more sales in the precious Black Friday weekend, the stakes are high for retailers. Talking about the increasing role of generative AI in retail, Moulton said considerable experimentation is going on in the industry. However, she considers the present time to be too early to see it at scale. She said that several leaders are leveraging generative AI the right way, which means that the strongest are getting stronger. They are taking early advantage of such new capabilities. This holds special importance since cookies are now much less easy to use because of their increased regulation. This makes Gen-AI a substitute that leaders are leaning into. A woman purchasing groceries at a Target store, with a cart full of products. We sifted through stock screeners and financial media reports to compile a list of 10 department store stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) operates general merchandise department stores that offer its customers a wide range of products. It has approximately 2,000 stores across the US. The company saw an increase in its traffic growth in fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was attributed to its focus on newness and delivering strong value in a retail environment where consumers are focusing on value and discounts over brand loyalty. The company thus introduced over 2,000 discounts entering the holiday season after it received positive customer response to the thousands of discounts and deals it offered at the beginning of 2024. Therefore, this initiative is expected to drive similar sales growth in the crucial holiday season. Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) comparable sales grew in fiscal Q3 2024, and this growth was attributed to a 2.4% growth in traffic. This translates to over 10 million incremental transactions compared to 2023. The company's digital channel also grew by nearly 11% in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting increasing consumer behavior trends in online shopping. Its delivery services are also boosting growth, with the company's same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360, experiencing approximately 20% growth. Its Drive Up service also saw positive double-digit growth, accounting for over $2 billion in fiscal Q3 2024 sales. These trends show the strength of Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) digital services as more and more consumers are interacting with them. Overall, TGT ranks 4th among the 7 best department store stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of department store stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TGT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock recommends 2% starting allocation to Bitcoin in investment portfolios

BlackRock compares Bitcoin's volatility to tech stocks, urging a cautious introduction in multi-asset portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to a paper released Dec. 12, BlackRock suggests that a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation in multi-asset portfolios matches the risk levels found in portfolios holding technology stocks. The asset manager, which oversees trillions of dollars, frames this range as a strategic starting point for investors seeking diverse sources of risk. Bitcoin is proposed as an element that does not entirely mirror the movement of equities. As Bloomberg reported, BlackRock’s analysis shows that even though Bitcoin exhibits a lower correlation to other assets, its volatility amplifies overall risk in a manner not unlike portfolios heavily concentrated in a handful of large technology names. BlackRock’s CIO of ETF and index investments, Samara Cohen, notes that a small Bitcoin weighting may operate as a separate risk driver in a balanced allocation. Beyond 2%, the firm warns that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility would contribute an outsized share of total risk, potentially overshadowing other components. Per Bloomberg, BlackRock considers the 1% to 2% range sufficient to approximate the influence of major tech holdings, a well-known scenario among investors grappling with top-heavy equity benchmarks. This perspective appears amid Bitcoin’s sustained gains following November’s US presidential election. Trump’s victory, combined with public endorsements and ongoing institutional inflows, saw Bitcoin surpass $100,000 in December. Market observers attribute part of Bitcoin’s growth to demand from institutional players, and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has captured attention as a key vehicle. The Bitcoin ETF has achieved rapid asset growth and attracted substantial inflows. Its expansion represents a trend that has bolstered Bitcoin’s acceptance among traditional investors and reshaped debates about prudent exposure. As Forbes reported, BlackRock’s research parallels the Magnificent Seven technology stocks that have dominated a large share of the S&P 500’s value. The firm notes that Bitcoin’s market capitalization is smaller, its utility differs, and its fundamental drivers do not resemble corporate revenue streams. Still, the allocation’s overall risk contributions resemble those of a portfolio that leans heavily into a single prominent equity holding. While past cycles saw Bitcoin’s correlation to equities tighten, recent conditions have shown more distinct patterns influenced by policy shifts, macroeconomic shifts, and evolving investor sentiment. The paper hints that as Bitcoin becomes more integrated into mainstream portfolios, its volatility profile may shift. Widespread institutional adoption could eventually temper price fluctuations, changing the asset’s returns. BlackRock’s position does not call for larger allocations at this stage but instead emphasizes measured sizing to maintain stable portfolio risk parameters. Its analysis provides a framework for investors weighing incremental Bitcoin exposure as the asset finds its place in long-term portfolio construction.

Investors are caught in a tug-of-war, balancing potential and risk as they await key developments. The past 40 days have been “highly volatile,” truly testing the patience of Bitcoin [BTC] stakeholders. The highs propelled BTC to its ATH of $104K, but the lows dragged it back to around $94K, leaving investors on edge. And the real challenge? It’s just beginning. Just two days ago, BlackRock’s (IBIT) support sparked nearly $300 million in net ETF inflows, sending Bitcoin surging 4% in one day. This institutional push helped BTC close above the $100K mark. But here’s the catch—the rally feels fragile. BlackRock’s inflows have since dwindled to net zero, signaling the end of a week-long surge streak. Even overall ETF inflows have halved. Meanwhile, whispers of a potential 25 bps rate cut by the Fed are keeping hopes alive, but Bitcoin’s biggest asset remains institutional backing. So, as early investors cash out as millionaires, all eyes are on the institutional heavyweights. Will they be the ones to push BTC toward the ambitious $200K target, or will their fading support trigger a new wave of doubt? Early investors seem to be cashing out at the pivotal $100K resistance level, signaling a retreat from greed and a pullback in risk appetite. Yet, the recent surge that catapulted Bitcoin above $101K—after weeks of fierce back-and-forth between the $94K and $100K price band—has sparked fresh optimism. According to AMBCrypto, this optimism remains somewhat cautious, driven more by “anticipation” than the actual “execution” of a Fed rate cut. While the U.S. job market shows promise with a decline in the unemployment rate, inflation has made a noticeable comeback. The CPI has risen to 2.7% on a yearly basis, with a slight 0.3% increase in just one month. With these mixed signals, all eyes are now on the upcoming FOMC meeting scheduled for next week. Will the Fed take a more conservative stance in response to the uptick in inflation, possibly opting for higher interest rates? Or will it lean more liberal, considering a rate cut to support the economy? Regardless, the short-term impact on Bitcoin’s price is already evident. Source : CryptoQuant U.S. investors have eagerly seized the opportunity to buy BTC, particularly through their Coinbase cohorts, after a period of distribution that dominated much of the second week of December. While this uptick is undeniably bullish, it could prove to be a temporary blip unless Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, spark sustained interest from both retail and institutional investors. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have become a popular way for retail investors to access Bitcoin’s volatility, with strong support from institutions. After the “Trump pump” sparked excitement, Bitcoin ETFs reached a record $1.3 billion in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $1.2 billion. Source : FarsideInvestors However, recent trends suggest a shift. BlackRock’s inflows have plateaued, ending a streak of consecutive gains. While this doesn’t signal a full bearish outlook for Bitcoin, it does highlight a dip in enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs, with overall inflows hitting a weekly low. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This reinforces AMBCrypto’s view of a more ‘cautious’ optimism in the market – enough to potentially set $100K as a bottom for Bitcoin, but not quite enough to drive it toward a new all-time high. Thus, the market is in a delicate balance, where hope remains, but the road to fresh highs seems uncertain.

Title: Wholesale inflation jumps more than expected as 'extended and bumpy journey' continues to Fed's target

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wholesale prices rose more than expected in November, adding to a string of sticky inflation prints. Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its producer price index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see — rose 3% from the year prior, up from the 2.4% in October and above the 2.6% increase economists had projected. This marked the highest year-over-year increase since February 2023. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4%, compared to the 0.2% seen in October. Excluding food and energy, "core" prices increased 3.4% year-over-year, above October's 3.1% increase. Economists had expected an increase of 3.2%. Meanwhile, month-over-month core prices increased 0.2%, in line with last month's rise and economist projections. “PPI isn’t so scary once you get past the headline," Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin said of this morning’s November Producer Price Index report. "While the underlying data quell fears of a new inflation surge, they don’t suggest a quick fall to 2% either. Producer prices, and the broader inflation complex, are on an extended and bumpy journey to the Fed’s goal.” Thursday's PPI reading comes one day after the release of the November Consumer Price Index showed core inflation rose 3.3% for the fourth straight month. The consumer price reading was largely in line with expectations, though, and did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. The sticky nature of the CPI print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Still, a combination of recent months of data has shown that inflation isn't quickly falling toward the Fed's 2% target. That has prompted investors to anticipate fewer Fed rate cuts in 2025 than initially hoped. "The Federal Reserve can feel largely pleased with the progress made on lowering high levels of inflation over the last couple years," BlackRock global CIO of fixed income Rick Rieder wrote in a note on Wednesday. "But the bulk of this progress is behind us now and inflation may remain stubbornly sticky near current levels for a time."

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.

We've seen pictures of his family, and heard their statements of shock and regret at the news. We learned he grew up wealthy, the son of the owner of two resorts near Baltimore. We learned he once worked in a nursing home owned by his family.

His age was similar, his engineering background was similar, his working in a nursing home was similar But we hear nothing of the level of information Mangione got from this miserable freak -- little about his political motivations, which political party he identified with, what his political views were, who his friends were, nothing about his very strange family who threw away their silverware to prevent police from finding it in a home search after the killing and attempted assassination, nothing about the strange associated classmates who could have been involved in the attack.

Founded by Martin Kassing (pictured above), the Berlin-based startup builds a white-label investment platform that is used by some of the biggest fintech companies in Europe. Upvest clients include Bunq, N26, Plum, Raisin, Revolut, Shares and Vivid. Overall, 50 million people can access Upvest’s trading platform. Signing all these big names as clients led to today’s news: Upvest is announcing a €100 million Series C round (or around $105 million at current exchange rates). Hedosophia, a VC firm that used to be somewhat secretive about their portfolio, is leading the round. Sapphire Ventures is also investing, as well as existing backers Bessemer Venture Partners and BlackRock. While Upvest isn’t disclosing its valuation following the Series C round, the company said it’s “significantly higher” than its previous valuation (after its $42 million Series B). “We believe their full-stack system addresses the unique challenges of enterprise banks, fintechs, and D2C platforms with exceptional usability, innovation, and resilience,” Sapphire Ventures partner Andreas Weiskam said in a statement. Companies that use Upvest’s API can offer fractional stock trading and access to other financial products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. The company doesn’t want to stop here as it plans to offer crypto, derivatives, ELTIFs (European Long-Term Investment Funds), and bonds in any currency in the near future. In 2024 alone, Upvest has processed 20 million orders. That figure should be much higher next year as the company has seen around one million trades per week recently. The startup also plans to sign new customers as it recently obtained an authorization from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate in the U.K. While Upvest can accept clients across the Eurozone and U.K., the company still has some work to do to offer a trading platform that feels truly local in all markets since many customers prefer to invest through special investment accounts. For instance in France, a regulated savings account that allows you to investment in a portfolio of shares of European companies — which is called a PEA (or Plan d’Épargne en Actions) — is particularly popular. Such accounts have been designed to encourage individuals to hold shares and securities over the long run. If they hold their positions for at least five years and make a profit, they get a preferential tax treatment. Similarly, the U.K. has other popular products like ISA (a tax-free savings account) and SIPP (a pension wrapper). Upvest is well aware of these geographic differences and plans to add support for local solutions in the future. Such additional features will create a barrier to entry for competitors trying to build a white-label investment platform. But on the topic of competitors, Bitpanda also offers a white-label solution that has been used by fintechs Lydia and N26 (for the crypto investment features). These companies aren’t just trying to build the best technological platform. They have to secure licenses, sign new partners, and scale with their clients. And Upvest now has plenty of money in the bank to support its next 50 million customers.

As a delicious starter, Frank Hederman at Belvelly Smokehouse recommends serving hot smoked salmon with al dente red cabbage spiced and sweetened with caramelised onion and dried fruits, and cut with fresh ginger, orange zest and background notes of sherry vinegar. frankhederman.com Master of ceremonies at Kilkenny Savour food festival Siobhan Donohue serves the family bread sauce recipe with a splash of Highbank Orchard’s organic apple treacle. O’Keefe likes a silky butter sauce spiked with white mausu smoky chilli oil. highbankorchards.com; savourkilkenny.com A visit to Forbes Street by Gareth Mullins, in Dublin’s Docklands, is the perfect start to the season. This motorcycle-riding, Donaghmeade born and bred chef believes that a wonderful all-Irish cheese board is the perfect food for sharing with family and friends as a yuletide feast. His counsel is to “start by choosing a soft goat cheese like St Tola from Co Clare, a delicious hard, like a Coolattin cheddar from west Wicklow, a washed-rind like Gubbeen from west Cork and, of course, a blue cheese, like Cashel Blue from Tipperary. Add a good relish, some grapes, toasted nuts, organic honey and crusty bread.” forbesstreet.ie For a fragrant finish to my Christmas meal, writes Clare Anne, I will be scattering Hadji Bey’s Original Rose Turkish Delight and pomegranates across the tablescape to create an edible centrepiece to be served with Cork’s wonderful Cafe Izz Palestinian coffee. Gifts will be unwrapped too at this stage. On my list this year is a Hugo Byrne knife to slice up Tom Durkan’s award-winning spiced beef. hugobyrneknives.com; corkcity.ie Canapés, anyone? Served either warm or cold, Ireland AM regular Edward Hayden’s beef and cranberry filo tartlets, and tangy lamb skewers, are easy-to-eat, bite-sized morsels that feature meat from O’Brien Butchers and John Stone. obrienbutchers.ie; johnstonebeef.com At a soirée at the home Katia Valadeau of ProperFood.ie a simple platter is served, consisting of smoked trout with crème fraîche, capers, shaved onions, lemon zest, dill and black pepper, topped with Irish caviar, specifically, Goatsbridge trout caviar. goatsbridgetrout.ie Bettina Lopes, a wine expert and co-owner of Little Italy, in Smithfield, Dublin 7, advocates an Italian aperitivo approach to party bites. She piles ricotta and truffle or delicious pistachio pesto on to slices of mortadella on ciabatta, served with an Amarena Spritz, the Italian cherry syrup with prosecco and a splash of Campari, or simply Amarena cherries dropped into Sanbitter Dry, to create a non-alcoholic festive spritz. She also brings a panettone as a host gift. littleitalyltd.com A walk, followed by time in your local, is a great way to gather with friends at Christmas. For Clare Anne, this usually means a tramp around the Phoenix Park to see the deer, followed by a glass of punch at L Mulligan Grocer, where Seáneen Sullivan, a food and folklore scholar, is the mixologist. Her party punch is made of one part lemon juice, two parts simple sugar syrup, three parts Longueville House apple brandy to four parts soda water – to be added when ordered, just before serving over ice, she explains. She chills the mixture, minus the soda water, in bottles and has it in her fridge to serve to guests or to bring to a party as a last-minute yet thoughtful gift. Her non-alcoholic version features Irish apple juice, cordials from Naturally Cordial in Wexford and a tonic from Poacher’s range. lmulligangrocer.com At home I shuck my own shells and add a teaspoon of ice-cold, Cuinneog, Irish farmhouse natural buttermilk, to my au nature bivalves. For a festive treat I book a table at Allta Bar and Bottle Shop, in Dublin’s Three Locks Square, where Cromane oysters are on the menu. I enjoy them with a drop of Allta’s house-made fermented chilli sauce. allta.ie Publican turned organic farmer Mick Foggarty’s Christmas highlight is his St Stephen’s Day sandwich. This features the usual leftovers but Mick’s secret is to add crushed bacon fries to the mix; he recommends picking up a pack in the pub on Christmas Eve before you leave. This whiskey expert and farmer of Beechpark Eco Farm, who is a fan of Crowe Farm’s outdoor-raised Bronze turkeys, sets out strict rules about how to construct this morning-after cure. [ It’s the most eagerly anticipated sandwich of the year. Here’s how to make yours epicOpens in new window ] “Heat your turkey in the leftover gravy and fry up the leftover veg,” says Mick. “Get two slices of bread and spread one side of each with cranberry sauce. Add the hot meat and gravy to the cranberry sauce side of one slice of bread and then top with the vegetables, crush the bacon fries and put them on top of the vegetables and then top with the other slice of bread, sauce side down. Cut in half, eat and say goodbye to that Christmas hangover.” beechparkfarm.com; crowefarm.ie Run out of fridge space? Don’t just think outside the box – think outside the house, says chef and author Graham Herterich: “When I need extra space in the fridge for the Christmas Day prep, I do a clear-out of half jars of condiments or vegetables or anything that’s not very perishable from the fridge and they move to either the boot of the car or a secure box outside for few days. “They’ll be grand outside in the cold, and it means we’ve loads of room then for all the extra Christmas meats and stuff like that.” Santa is not the only one who needs a list, says cook and food writer William Murray: “A key tool of experienced cooks and chefs is an ‘order of work’, a detailed yet straightforward list and plan of attack for the big day with times and jobs. Things like getting your prep done, when to preheat the oven, what to put in the oven in what order etc. “Some of these things might seem obvious but, trust me, having a detailed plan to refer to on the day is essential, especially if you tend to be messy like me. And don’t forget the delegation of jobs to others.” Ikea is not a place most of us would think about picking up Christmas food but it’s a must for Mickael Viljanen, chef-patron of two-Michelin-starred Chapter One. He pairs Ikea gingerbread biscuits with Cashel Blue for a Christmas Eve treat: “They’re delicious together with a lovely glass of wine, like a dry Riesling.” He’s also into adding some sweetness to his stuffing: “Instead of using normal breadcrumbs, I blitz up a loaf of brioche into breadcrumbs. It soaks up the fat and flavours much better, and makes a much tastier stuffing. I like to add some dried cranberries to mine, as well as the usual herbs.” Chef Barry Sun of Volpe Nero in Dublin is also thinking ahead about snacks when he’s planning: “I always purchase the makings of some simple snacks to serve with Christmas drinks. I like to slice and toast good quality sourdough, add a drizzle of olive oil, a spoon of stracciatella, finish with anchovy fillets and season. Simple but always impressive”. A whole turkey can often be too much if you’re cooking for a smaller number, says Carol Barrett, owner of Dunmore House Hotel in Co Cork. To avoid any waste, she recommends asking your butcher to take off the legs and mince the leg meat, to be used another time. “It’s great for a bolognese pasta or burgers in the new year,” says Barrett. “This also makes your turkey crown easier to roast and manage.” To brine or not to brine is often a question when it comes to Christmas turkey. Chef Dan Hannigan is firmly in the brining camp. “I always brine my turkey,” he says. “It imparts extra flavour – and not just for the turkey. A sneaky little extra tip would be to reserve some of your brine and add cabbages cut into four pieces, with the root left on, for a couple of hours, and then pan fry them when cooking the dinner for the most sensational cabbage of your life.” Or how about jazzing up shop-bought cranberry sauce? Sateesh Sayana, chef-patron of Ruchii restaurant in Blackrock, Co Dublin, spices his jarred sauce with sliced apple and pears. “Toss them in a pan with butter, bay leaves, cinnamon and sugar. Once the fruits have caramelised, add to the cranberry sauce. This little addition will elevate the tart cranberry flavour and show your guests you went to a little extra effort when serving your turkey and ham.” If you’re catering for vegetarians and vegans, don’t forget to ditch the duck fat when roasting your spuds. Instead, Holly White offers advice for getting perfect crispy potatoes that will satisfy everyone at the table. “To boost the flavour of my roast potatoes once they are parboiled I coat them in lots of crushed garlic, thyme and olive oil before roasting them in a hot oven until crisp. I make sure to shuffle them halfway through, breaking up the edges, allowing them to absorb all the flavours, and then serve them piping hot and seasoned well.” There’s nothing quite like a freshly baked mince pie at Christmas but making the real deal can be laborious. Instead, JR Ryall, head pastry chef at Ballymaloe House, has a quick-fix idea he calls “a festive game-changer”: bite-size mince pie turnovers. “They’re so much quicker to assemble than traditional mince pies, and the best part is that they can be baked straight from the freezer,” says Ryall. “Every year, in late November, I set aside some time to make a batch. I simply fold a small circle of pastry over a spoonful of mince-pie filling, creating little half-moon pies, seal the edges, and freeze them on trays. Once they’re frozen, I store them in an airtight container, ready to be baked whenever Christmas visitors arrive. No special baking tray required.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Today, the city is exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial system. Vancouver City Council voted Wednesday to explore ways to make the city "Bitcoin-friendly," taking a bold step into crypto despite potential regulatory hurdles. The controversial motion, spearheaded by Mayor Ken Sim, was approved at the City Council's Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday. Specifically, the motion directs council staff to explore accepting taxes and fees in Bitcoin and converting part of the city’s financial reserves into Bitcoin to protect against inflation and currency volatility. Thirty-four people spoke to the motion, with supporters from ABC Vancouver and opposition from Green Party members. Sim is a party member of the former. While the approval doesn't immediately commit the city to crypto investments, it initiates a comprehensive study of potential Bitcoin integration into municipal finances. However, the directive faces immediate roadblocks. The British Columbia Ministry of Municipal Affairs confirmed that crypto isn't currently recognized as a legal form of payment for municipalities, explicitly stating that local governments cannot hold financial reserves in crypto. Sim, who has disclosed that he has investments in Coinbase Global and Purpose Bitcoin ETF, remained undeterred. "Bitcoin is the number one performing asset on the planet over the last 16 years," Sim said in an interview with Canadian news outlet Global News before the vote. "To not even look at including it as a part of a diversified portfolio is, I think, reckless," he added. The council chamber saw divided opinions among its members. ABC Councilor Peter Meiszner, while voting in favor, expressed caution about the difference between private and public crypto investment. Meanwhile, Green Councilor Pete Fry opposed the motion, citing money laundering concerns previously raised by the Vancouver Police Department. "Governments have to catch up," Sim said, pledging a personal $10,000 Bitcoin donation to the city regardless of the vote's outcome. Environmental implications also emerged as a key point of contention. Councilor Adriane Carr highlighted worries about Bitcoin's electricity demands, which are particularly relevant given recent council debates about the city's power grid capacity. Decrypt has reached out to ABC Vancouver for comments on how this could be implemented once the feasibility study is completed. The approved motion directs city staff to return with a feasibility report by Q1 2025, examining potential crypto integration into municipal operations and investment strategies. That timeline coincides with the broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin, including recent moves by major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity. Bitcoin is trading at just over $100,000, a price milestone that it reached 15 years after Satoshi Nakamoto, its creator, envisioned a financial revolution.

Title: Future proofing: BlackRock’s billionaire bonanza and putting talent to work

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is adding a clutch of new billionaires to its payroll. Photo / 123RF OPINION BlackRock has bought a bonanza of billionaires. Now comes the challenge of keeping them in line. The world’s largest asset manager has been on a US$28 billion ($48.2b) acquisition tear, snapping up two of the best known firms that specialise in the complex and rapidly growing fields of infrastructure, private credit and other alternative assets. To gain a stronger foothold, the US$11.5 trillion money manager has opted to pay dearly for outside talent and take steps to ensure that it sticks around long enough to make a difference. Last week’s US$12b-plus deal for private credit specialist HPS will make billionaires of Scott Kapnick and the other two founders, but they will be paid out over a five-year period and the final total is contingent on the deal meeting performance targets. Similarly, BlackRock’s US$12.5b purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners earlier this year has collectively made five GIP founders the second largest BlackRock shareholder, and it too has a five-year payout. The £2.55b ($5.6b) deal for private markets data provider Preqin is an all-cash transaction so it places fewer constraints on founder Mark O’Hare, but he had already stepped down as chief executive in 2022. With nine new billionaires due to come on the payroll, BlackRock founder Larry Fink is moving quickly to put them to work. The top two GIP executives have already joined BlackRock’s global executive committee and the three HPS founders will follow suit. GIP chair Adebayo Ogunlesi also sits on the BlackRock board of directors, while Kapnick will become an observer. In theory, that all makes good sense. While BlackRock has built a commanding position in traditional asset management and associated technology, its private markets business has historically punched below its weight. Ogunlesi and Kapnick are towering Wall Street figures, with entrepreneurial chops in precisely the areas where the larger firm wants to grow. Each has staked his personal wealth and substantial reputation on becoming part of what Fink likes to refer to as “One BlackRock”, with all the cross-selling and joint product development that implies. In practice, management meetings with that many newly minted billionaires in the room are going to be something to behold. These are men accustomed to running their own shows. Now they must deal with one another, the other BlackRock executives, and the constraints of being part of a 20,000-employee public company. Fink, of course, is more than qualified to play ringmaster to his newly recruited private capital lions. They may have created highly profitable boutiques, but he has built a global juggernaut and run it for more than 35 years. He also has experience with integrating multiple bet-the-farm acquisitions, including the 2006 deal for Merrill Lynch’s asset management arm and the 2009 purchase of Barclays Global Investors. That invites the question of what happens after Fink, who recently turned 72, steps back. Before the HPS deal, he had been walking a fine line between saying he still loved his job while also assuring investors that he had “no higher priority” than ensuring a smooth succession. Last January, the company granted chunky stock option packages to three men it described as “senior leaders who we believe will play critical roles in BlackRock’s future”. Rob Goldstein, Martin Small, and Mark Wiedman are longtime BlackRock managers, rather than entrepreneurs like the new arrivals. “Buying an entrepreneurial business is very risky because entrepreneurs drive it in a particular way and managers don’t ... They don’t fit together particularly well,” says Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert. BlackRock could tap one of the HPS or GIP leaders to replace Fink, but each firm is so highly specialised that BlackRock watchers find it hard to imagine the leader of one or the other at the top of the gigantic financial supermarket that the company has become. Fink currently shows no sign of slowing down. He has been on the road all year visiting clients and political leaders, including recent high profile stops in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. He also sounded energised on last week’s investor call about the challenges of integration and the prospects of combining HPS with BlackRock’s offerings. Still, investors and BlackRock’s board cannot afford to be complacent. The company is due to appoint a new lead independent director in 2025. That person should take a fresh look at transition planning and consider whether the pool of possible candidates is large and deep enough. The bigger Fink’s shoes grow, the harder they will be to fill. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Merely 0.55% of shareholders supported a proposal for buying and holding Bitcoin. The leading crypto by market capitalization surpassed $100,000 per coin once again on Wednesday. According to the annual Microsoft Investor Relations report, 28.234 million Microsoft shareholder votes were cast in favor of the proposal, compared to an overwhelming 5.148 billion against, with 22.6 million abstentions. Microsoft’s board of directors urged shareholders to vote down the proposal ahead of the shareholder vote, citing the cryptocurrency’s volatility. “Bitcoin is a more volatile asset, at the moment than corporate bonds, so companies should not risk shareholder value by holding too much of it,” Microsoft said during the shareholder meeting. “However, as Bitcoin is an excellent, if not the best, hedge against inflation and corporate bond yields are less than the true inflation rate, companies should also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether.” While the majority of shareholders rejected the proposal, Microsoft acknowledged that companies should evaluate the benefits of holding at least 1% of their assets in Bitcoin. The Microsoft shareholder's ultimate vote comes as several companies begin to stack the asset on their balance sheets this year as part of their corporate strategies. Earlier this month, healthcare technology company, Semler Scientific, added $30 million in Bitcoin. On Monday, the National Center for Public Policy recommended Amazon convert at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. A decision is expected sometime next year in the Spring. Microsoft highlighted Microstrategy as the largest private Bitcoin holder. This company recently acquired an additional $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at approximately $42 billion. “Microstrategy—which, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet—has had its stock outperform Microsoft stock this year by 313% despite doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has. And they’re not alone,” according to a proxy statement. “The institutional and corporate adoption of Bitcoin is becoming more commonplace.

Title: Business cycle remains a real risk for markets

Time Published: 2024-12-11T22:00:00Z
Full Content:
Whatever 2025 holds for world markets, talk of an end to business cycle investing eerily reflects past periods of hubris and makes all the persistent bullishness seem slightly reckless. The years since 2020 have been extraordinary, with pandemic-distorted supply and demand patterns that are still playing out. Serial geopolitical shocks and mega trends in technology and green energy have followed. Amidst all that, inflation in Western economies recorded its biggest spike in 40 years, and central banks scrambled to snuff it out with the most brutal credit tightening in decades. But setting aside the deep but brief pandemic-induced economic contraction in early 2020, the United States has managed to avoid a recession. And few if any forecasters see one unfolding next year. For BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, it is simply different this time. "We've argued since 2020 that we are not in a business cycle," it said in its 2025 outlook. "Historical trends are being permanently broken in real time as mega forces, like the rise of artificial intelligence, transform economies." Ignoring the business cycle is a big call and certainly a brave one at this stage. Yet, looking at the United States over the past few years, it's hard to argue against it. Previously near foolproof bellwethers of cyclical downturns, such as the inverted yield curve or the 'Sahm Rule' on when rising joblessness presages a downturn -- have flashed bright red, but to no avail. US real GDP has expanded continuously since a one-quarter contraction in the first three months of 2022 and as 2024 comes to a close, growth rates are still well above trend at more than 3%. If anything, that looks set to be underscored by both lower interest rates and tax cuts next year. Even the most dogged bears on Wall Street have thrown in the towel, seemingly assured that the services-dominated US economy can sail on unfettered. Most of the big brokers expect further punchy gains for Wall Street stocks in 2025. The already expensive S&P 500, still led mostly by a narrow group of mega-cap tech giants, is set to record its second consecutive year of 25%-plus gains for the first time since 1998. RESONATING MILESTONES All the same, comparisons to the late 1990s should ring some alarm bells. The final years on the last century were certainly different to today but there are also uncanny parallels with the present, including mounting euphoria about a US-dominated technology, a turbulent world economy and seemingly Teflon US growth. The end of the Cold War had given rise to many hubristic books, most famously Francis Fukuyama's bestseller The End of History and the Last Man on the durable triumph of liberal democracy. By the end of the decade, the internet bubble gave vent to endless talk about business cycle being transcended in the face of transformative technology and US exceptionalism. What's more, there were also a few hesitant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts that kept the expansion going before eventually being reversed as the economy dodged turbulence abroad and the domestic bubble grew bigger. The upshot? A tech-led bubble burst in 2000, ushering in three years of consecutive S&P 500 losses -- the longest series of annual downturns since World War II. It took seven years to recover the peaks of 2000, just before the banking crash hit. To be sure, anyone who stuck with durable tech names that survived the dot.com bust made a fortune over the past 20 years. But the business and investment cycle was far from ending. TEFLON ECONOMY So what could go wrong now? Even if there is a cogent argument for continued US economic and market outperformance next year, it's hard to see how America remains entirely insulated if there is significant economic weakness overseas. Asset managers' 2025 outlooks all dwell heavily on the uncertainties surrounding the incoming administration of US president-elect Donald Trump. And they all acknowledge that some type of trade war is in the offing, with China, Europe and even US neighbours Canada and Mexico all in the crosshairs. A global economic hit from tit-for-tat tariff salvos and investment curbs could come back to haunt the United States if it stymies world demand or lifts US prices, causing the Fed to halt or reverse its policy easing. BlackRock's view, for the record, is that the US and global economies may well experience bouts of turbulence in the coming year. But their conclusion is that such moves would only impact tactical trades and that major investment decisions should stay focused on multi-year big themes, such as artificial intelligence and green energy. But even if the United States can remain an "oasis of prosperity", in the words of another famed phrase from the late 1990s, financial distortions could eventually sow the seeds of an eventual fall. Monetary easing around the world has already accelerated, potentially in response to trade fears. This is buoying the dollar and holding down US Treasury yields, too, as investors rotate into what's now become a high-yielding "safe asset". Some argue that inappropriately low US long-term borrowing rates could, by themselves, catalyse a downfall by overheating the economy and further inflating asset bubbles. That scenario suggests that any downturn likely wouldn't come next year. But the rumoured death of the business cycle may yet prove to be greatly exaggerated.

Title: Why EOG Resources (EOG) Is One of the Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks to Invest in?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Most Profitable Natural Gas Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to look at where EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) stands against other most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. On November 4, the Canadian government, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, announced preliminary regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the oil and gas sector by 35% from 2019 levels over the next eight years. These regulations are set to be implemented through a cap-and-trade system, which will establish a legal limit on the sector’s emissions, allowing companies to buy and sell a limited number of emissions allowances. The cap is expected to be enforced starting in 2030, with gradual reductions until Canada achieves net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan is set to be finalized in the coming year and phased in starting in 2026. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers has expressed concerns that the cap will lead to production cuts and a reduction in business investment. The effectiveness and implementation of this policy remains uncertain, as the governing Liberal Party faces a significant challenge from the Conservative Party, which is leading in the polls ahead of the next election, scheduled no later than October 2026.

In an interview with CNBC on September 11, Katie Stockton, Founder of Fairlead Strategies discussed the potential for a natural gas trade as the market shows signs of basing and improving momentum. Stockton began by noting that natural gas prices have experienced a significant decline, with a 75% drop from September 2022. This dramatic decrease has put natural gas in a long-term downtrend, making it a challenging and volatile asset to trade. One of the key indicators Stockton highlighted is the long-term momentum gauge for natural gas prices. For the first time since the beginning of 2023, this gauge has flipped to a buy signal, indicating a significant shift in the long-term trend. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the downward momentum may be reversing. Additionally, natural gas has been showing signs of basing for several months, which is a positive signal for potential upside movement. Stockton also pointed out that short-term momentum has been improving. Natural gas futures have recently moved above their 50-day moving average, a key technical level that often signals short-term strength. The prices are now testing the 200-day moving average, another critical resistance level. Breaking through this level could trigger more buying interest and potentially lead to a sustained upward trend. Natural gas has become a key part of the world’s energy supply, serving as a bridge between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. This increased demand is expected to help stabilize prices and open up new opportunities for investors. To compile our list of the 8 most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest gas companies. We shortlisted companies with a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 15% and a minimum net income of $1 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM) as informed by SeekingAlpha. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 46 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 19.01% TTM Net Income: $7.14 Billion EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) was established in 1985 and is based in Houston, Texas. The company along with its subsidiaries, engages in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, primarily in active basins within the United States, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and other international locations. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is making strategic infrastructure investments that are designed to ensure that the company can capitalize on the growing demand for North American natural gas. The company is building the Janus gas plant in the Delaware Basin, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Furthermore, the company has completed the Verde pipeline, which will be primarily used to transport natural gas extracted from the Dorado play in South Texas to the Agua Dulce hub in Texas to allow the company to access the Gulf Coast market. The company is optimistic that new LNG projects, exports to Mexico, and increased power generation will drive about 10 to 12 billion cubic feet per day of new LNG capacity starting in 2025 and continuing through 2027. To capitalize on this trend, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) in 2022, announced to drill 25 wells using two rigs in the Dorado area, which is part of the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations. However, during the Q3 earnings call, management informed that the company now plans to continue a one-rig program in the Dorado area to improve efficiency and deepen its understanding of the play. The company estimates that Dorado holds about 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas with a production cost of less than $1.25 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). Overall, EOG ranks 3rd on our list of one of the most profitable natural gas stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of EOG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India’s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025. READ ALSO: 10 Oil Stocks with Biggest Upside Potential According to Analysts and 7 Best Emerging Markets Stocks To Buy Now. On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman’s prime brokerage trading desk. Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide.

Gareth 'Gaz' Smith Well-known Dublin chef Gareth ‘Gaz’ Smith has said his popular Blackrock restaurant Big Mike’s is continuing on despite financial difficulties and the jobs of his employees “are secure”. A notice on the Big Mike’s website noted that a “process adviser” had been appointed to the company behind the restaurant. The appointment of a process adviser is part of the Small Company Administrative Rescue Process (SCARP). In order for a company to avail of the scheme, it must be “fundamentally viable and capable of trading its way out of its current difficulties,” according to the Department of Enterprise. Under the scheme, the process adviser is tasked with putting together a rescue plan for the business and working with creditors to consolidate debts. Mr Smith has confirmed the restaurant started the SCARP process and said there is “a really strong business model in place”. He said the team at Big Mike’s is moving forward “with their head high and chests out”. “We’re three weeks into the seven-week Government SCARP process, and things are progressing well,” Mr Smith said in a statement. "Our ambitious project resulted in huge fit out costs from Covid days (when materials costs were 4-5 times the norm) and we’ve tried our very best to maintain those repayments out of cash flow, and we need a pressure release from that. As confirmed by the comprehensive SCARP report. “We’ve a really strong business model in place with options and support in the background. Jobs are secure, vouchers will be honoured, suppliers have been incredible, and our team is moving forward with their heads high and chests out.” Mr Smith said “it would be irresponsible” for him as an employer “not to do everything in my power” to keep staff on the restaurant’s payroll rather than the Government’s He said there has been “exceptional” engagement and good faith from all parties involved, including Revenue, lenders, suppliers, and the process facilitators, and this is the reason the business is already halfway through the SCARP process. “There’s no sugarcoating it – this isn’t easy – but it’s a lot better than the alternative. We’re staying focused, proactive, and optimistic about the future,” he added. “Very often the whispers are ten times worse than the truth, we’ve been incredibly transparent with everybody and everybody has shown incredible support, we’re very grateful for the goodwill.” In July of this year, Mr Smith confirmed the closure of his Mount Merrion-based restaurant Michael’s in order to concentrate his business on Big Mike’s, with staff from Michael’s taking up positions at the Blackrock location.

Title: Why Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-alphabet-inc-googl-best-185237926.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 202 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. While it relies primarily on its search engine and advertising to account for nearly 70% of its revenue, the firm also plays a key role in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business. Waymo is one of the few companies in the US whose cars regularly travel on roads to finetune their self-driving capabilities. Yet, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Waymo have also been dealt setbacks from the inherent risks of autonomous driving platforms being vulnerable to accidents. On the flip side, Waymo’s prowess with self-driving also provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a commanding position in a market that can grow in the future. As a whole, the narrative depends on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s dominance in the search engine market and its ability to fend off any legal troubles that might head its way. Conventum – Alluvium Global Fund mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google/YouTube, having returned 20.8% in the June quarter, gave a fair bit of that back by falling 8.8%. Its results seemed pretty positive, and appeared to beat expectations. Management claims its AI integration into its search business is working well, and the margin expansion from costs out is expected to continue. Market chatter suggests that the selloff stems from concerns about the high capital spending on servers and data center equipment. Alphabet has made it clear that this spending is necessary, and somewhat defensive as it can’t risk losing the AI war (a “build it, and they will come” approach). Also, the new Department of Justice case against it probably did not help matters. Nonetheless, we saw no need to adjust our estimates. We wrote last quarter that it traded at a premium to our valuation, but not so much as to warrant selling. With the share price falling and the premium reducing, our view is unchanged. It represents 4.4% of the Fund.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Alternative Fuel Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to look at where Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) stands against other best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The alternative fuel and renewable energy industry is currently one of the fastest-growing sectors globally. Examples of alternatives include wind, solar, nuclear, hydropower, and biofuel energy. According to the Business Research Company, the global alternative fuel or renewable energy market was valued at $1.10 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1.55 trillion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.8%. Growing environmental concerns and stringent environmental regulations in many developed countries have significantly boosted the renewable energy sector, leading to an increase in installed capacity for renewable sources. The increasing power demand and energy consumption are also key drivers of the growing demand in the alternative or renewable fuels industry. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is expected to increase by 3.4% annually by 2026, with 85% of this additional demand coming from China and India. India’s electricity demand alone is predicted to grow by over 6% annually until 2026, driven by economic growth and rising air conditioning use. Southeast Asia is also expected to see a 5% annual increase in electricity demand through 2026. In the United States, a moderate rise in electricity demand is anticipated in the coming years, primarily driven by data centers. The electricity consumption by data centers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency could potentially double to 1,000 TWh by 2026. The IEA forecasts that the surge in electricity generation from low-emission sources will meet global demand growth over the next three years, with renewable energy expected to surpass coal as the leading energy source by early 2025.

On November 11, Reuters reported that hedge funds rapidly increased their investments in bank stocks, marking the fastest pace in three years, while simultaneously reducing their holdings in renewable energy companies, according to a note from Goldman Sachs. This shift in investment strategy came in response to Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. presidential election. Financial stocks, including banks, have become the most favored and most net-purchased sector on Goldman’s prime brokerage trading desk. Additionally, hedge funds placed long bets on consumer finance, capital markets, and financial services companies, with a focus on US stocks and equities in developing Asia and Europe, where they exited short positions and added long ones. In contrast, utility companies, especially independent power, and renewable electricity producers faced heavy selling, with hedge funds taking two short positions for every long position in U.S. utility companies. Despite short-term challenges, the rapid growth and increasing investment in alternative fuel and renewable energy reflects a global shift towards sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions. As renewable technologies continue to advance and become more cost-effective, they are increasingly becoming the preferred choice for new energy projects worldwide. To compile our list of the 10 best alternative fuel stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used Clean Energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 alternative fuel stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s December Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) stands against other stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the evolution of AI and how the technology has come from being ignored as “hype” to now completely changing everyday lives for many. Cramer mentioned the AI solutions offered by Marc Benioff’s company and said the technology is actually exceeding expectations “dramatically.” [read Marc Benioff’s latest comments here] Cramer mentioned the comments of Benioff on his company’s new AI-powered solutions: “Suddenly, though, we have Agent Force, and with it, Marc said, I quote, “We’re unleashing this new year of digital labor force for every business and every industry.” He went on to say, quote, “The implications are just simply profound. Now people ridicule me for saying how much we need AI, but Marc says, quote, ‘For decades, economic growth depended on expanding the human workforce. It was all about getting more labor,’ end quote. Not anymore—not with agents powered by AI who, as you’re stating, can work faster, doing tedious things but essential jobs that nobody wants.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of shelves in a retail pharmacy, demonstrating the variety of drugs and over-the-counter products. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 63 Talking about CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Jim Cramer said in a recent program on CNBC that he’s waiting to see where the stock bottoms and said he sees “maybe” another bad quarter for the company. “I’ve been waiting to see where it could bottom, and Deutsche Banks taking the leap might be a little too early because there could be one more bad quarter. But it’s worth talking about, and I think it’s good. It’s better than Honeywell, which is down five, because they don’t know how to tell the story.” Cramer said CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) new CEO David Joyner is doing a “good job.” What ails CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) is the rising competition. CVS has expanded beyond retail, particularly after acquiring Aetna in 2018, but retail and pharmacy sales still account for around 50% of its total revenue. The pharmacy services segment is facing growing competition from non-traditional retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Costco, as well as from new disruptors like Mark Cuban’s Cost Plus Drugs and Amazon, which has expanded into healthcare and pharmaceutical sales. Retail margins are also under pressure, with competitors offering cheaper prescriptions and household goods. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) market share in pharmacy services has only grown modestly, from 23.8% in 2017 to 25.7% in 2023, despite significant acquisitions. CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) has spent $96.6 billion on deals like Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street Health. Meanwhile, CVS’s long-term debt has risen sharply, from $25.1 billion in 2017 to $65 billion, and shares outstanding have grown at an annual rate of 3.5%. Coho Relative Value Equity Strategy stated the following regarding CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “While we believe each of those companies is performing in line with or better than our expectations and that the moves lower are unjustified, both CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) and Nike reported disappointing performance in recent results. In CVS’ case, management gave an optimistic outlook to 2024 at its December Investor Day, which we believed was consistent with our expectations. Unfortunately, management misestimated its medical loss ratio and the anticipated profitability in its book for Medicare Advantaged lives. This triggered a position paper violation, as the company’s financial flexibility now looks constrained in both 2024 and 2025.” Overall, CVS ranks 4th on our list of stocks to watch in Jim Cramer’s December portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of CVS, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks. As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, experts are increasingly focusing on how its integration will impact investment strategies. The growth of AI presents a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios, not only by targeting leading tech companies but also by considering the broader ecosystem, including infrastructure and cybersecurity. In a CNBC interview, Jay Jacobs from BlackRock and ETF expert Dave Nadig discussed the future of ETFs in 2025, particularly focusing on the accelerating phase of AI infrastructure. Jacobs highlighted that AI adoption is still in its early stages, with significant investments being made by megacap tech companies in data centers, chips, and model training. He emphasized the importance of looking beyond just the tech giants, as other sectors like semiconductors, data centers, and software companies are poised to benefit from AI. Jacobs also pointed out that cybersecurity investments are becoming more crucial as the value of data grows. Nadig added that AI's impact will also extend to infrastructure sectors, especially power, and emphasized the importance of retail companies integrating AI into consumer devices. Finally, both experts acknowledged the growing importance of physical infrastructure, such as electricity, data centers, and materials like copper, in supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies.

Currently, OpenAI offers a $20-per-month plan for consumers and a $200 option for access to more powerful models. The company also charges businesses on a per-user basis. In the future, Friar suggested the possibility of a value-based pricing model for AI products, based on the benefits companies gain, such as automating tasks and reducing the need for additional employees. This approach could help offset the high costs of developing AI systems. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Title: Is SoFi Technologies (SOFI) the Worst ARK Stock to Buy According to Short Sellers?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Worst ARK Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) stands against other worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. Cathie Wood of ARK Investment is one of Wall Street’s most well-known hedge fund bosses. In a hedge fund industry dominated by players that focus on quantitative trading, value stocks, and balanced portfolios, Wood stands out from the pack by focusing on disruptive innovation and firms that she and her firm believe will change the world. This relentless focus on change means that if the economy is facing turbulence, then markets are not kind to Wood. To understand how: consider the cumulative value of her firm’s holdings as indicated by its 13F SEC filings. Starting from Q3 2020, analyzing the value for each subsequent year’s third quarter reveals how Ark Invest’s fortune fluctuates with economic winds. The hedge fund’s holdings were valued at $16.8 billion, $41.6 billion, $14.3 billion, and $13 billion during Q3 2020, Q3 2021, Q3 2022, and Q3 2023, respectively. This shows that the value of Ark Invest’s holdings jumped by 148% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021. Looking back to see why, market conditions back then were marked by easy liquidity, a surge in retail investing, and Wall Street’s bullishness for technology stocks. Technology and growth stocks are precisely the kinds that Wood invests in, and in the time period being analyzed, the shares of Elon Musk’s car company alone soared by 87%. Wood is one of the firm’s largest investors, and her patience has yielded results. Insider Monkey’s data shows that Ark Invest first bought the shares at an average price of $13.14 during Q4 2016. While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%. For our list of the worst Ark stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the 110 largest holdings in Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 SEC filings by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the highest percentage. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 13.70% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 31 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $99.1 million SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) is a sizable financial services provider based in San Francisco, California. It provides lending services, financial technology products, and benefits management products among others. The firm depends heavily on interest income to fund its operations. As of H1 2024, SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI) earned $1.3 billion in interest income and $428 million in noninterest income. Consequently, a lower interest rate environment could play out in its favor as services such as loan refinancing, mortgages, and personal loans see greater demand from consumers. The bulk of SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s interest income is from loans, and the firm’s noninterest income comes from various areas such as its technology platforms. In H1, income from technology platforms grew by 11% to somewhat mitigate the effects of a 48% drop in loan origination income due to high interest rates. SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI)’s management commented on its outlook of a relaxed regulatory environment during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “It should now be crystal clear that SoFi can drive sustained growth across the cycle. We’ve achieved 17 of 19 quarters of record revenue through a recession, a pandemic, a 150 basis point rate drop, damage to our largest and most profitable business, student loan refinance, only to face a 500 basis point increase in rates and the collapse of venerable financial institutions in our neighborhood. The innovations we have driven to scale our non-lending revenue, which are capital-light and high ROE, have enabled us to grow our total revenue by more than 20% year-over-year for 17 consecutive quarters, as well as grow both our members and products by 35% or more year-over-year, excluding digital asset accounts transferred in 2023. Our performance in the hard times is what gives me strong confidence in our future. Overall, SOFI ranks 9th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of SOFI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOFI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Worst ARK Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) stands against other worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. Cathie Wood of ARK Investment is one of Wall Street’s most well-known hedge fund bosses. In a hedge fund industry dominated by players that focus on quantitative trading, value stocks, and balanced portfolios, Wood stands out from the pack by focusing on disruptive innovation and firms that she and her firm believe will change the world. This relentless focus on change means that if the economy is facing turbulence, then markets are not kind to Wood. To understand how: consider the cumulative value of her firm’s holdings as indicated by its 13F SEC filings. Starting from Q3 2020, analyzing the value for each subsequent year’s third quarter reveals how Ark Invest’s fortune fluctuates with economic winds. The hedge fund’s holdings were valued at $16.8 billion, $41.6 billion, $14.3 billion, and $13 billion during Q3 2020, Q3 2021, Q3 2022, and Q3 2023, respectively. This shows that the value of Ark Invest’s holdings jumped by 148% between the third quarters of 2020 and 2021. Looking back to see why, market conditions back then were marked by easy liquidity, a surge in retail investing, and Wall Street’s bullishness for technology stocks. Technology and growth stocks are precisely the kinds that Wood invests in, and in the time period being analyzed, the shares of Elon Musk’s car company alone soared by 87%. Wood is one of the firm’s largest investors, and her patience has yielded results. Insider Monkey’s data shows that Ark Invest first bought the shares at an average price of $13.14 during Q4 2016. While it has grown its holdings from the 274,725 shares held back then to 4.6 million shares as of Q3 2024, even if Wood hadn’t bought additional shares, her original holdings would currently be worth $62.7 million right now for a remarkable 1,508% gain! Yet, while Musk’s company is Wood’s greatest hit, there have been misses as well since the idea of investing in disruptive innovation carries the unavoidable pitfall of targeting some firms that fail to deliver on lofty ideas. We analyzed the share price performance of some of her longest-held stocks as part of our coverage of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years According to Cathie Wood. At the time the list was published, its three worst-performing stocks were down by 81.85%, 95.11%, and 99% since 2020 end. Extrapolating their performance to December 2024, the first two stocks, which rank 2nd and 4th have lost 75% and 94.5%. At the heart of Ark Invest’s trading strategy is the fund’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF fund. Over the past five years, this fund has gained a modest 23% which is substantially lower than the flagship S&P index’s 93.5%. Zooming into its 2024 performance, this fund has gained 20.5% while the index is up by 28.3%. Wood’s ETF’s performance can also be divided into pre and post-election gains. Before the election, it was down 7.6% year-to-date after having bled 13% during H1 2024. As H1 ended, Wood acknowledged the troubling time her firm was facing in an investor letter. She admitted “fully that the macro environment and some stock picks have challenged our recent performance” but went on to add that her firm’s “conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered.” According to Wood, Ark had to remain persistent back then since exiting our strategies now would crystallize losses that lower interest rates and reversions to the mean should transform into meaningful profits during the next few years.” The mean reversion she is referring to is the differential in the performance between the Russel Value and Growth stock indexes in the infamous dot-com bubble. Wood pointed out that “At its worst in 2000, the Russell Value Index underperformed the Russell Growth Index by more ~3,500 basis points on a year-over-year basis but, within roughly one year, the relative performance flipped and reached a positive ~4,800 basis points, more than an 80-percentage point swing, as shown below.” She believes that Ark’s strategy to diversify away from the Magnificent 6 (Magnificent 7 ex Tesla) through “increased exposure to multiomics stocks that have been hit hardest by “higher for longer” interest rates” led to disappointing performance. The potential upside from this diversification was evident in 2023 as the flagship fund “appreciated 68% as the bull market started to broaden out based on just the “whiff” of lower interest rates, despite its diversification away from the Magnificent Six and toward what we believe are more disruptive names,” according to Wood. To wit, while the flagship fund was down 7.6% YTD before the election after the ballots were cast and counted, it has gained 26% to bring its YTD performance to 20.46%. The benchmark S&P index, on the other hand, is up by 28.3%.

Short Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 16.07% Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 30 Ark Invest’s Q3 2024 Stake: $251 million Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is another genomic stock. The firm is developing treatments for diseases such as angioedema, lung ailments, hemophilia, and others. Since Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) does not sell any drugs in the market, under-development treatments are crucial to the firm’s hypothesis. Two of its leading drug candidates are NTLA-2002 and NTLA-2001. These drugs target angioedema and cardiomyopathy, respectively. They are currently in Phase 2 trials and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) is enrolling patients for NTLA-2002’s Phase 3 trials. The firm’s shares are down 52% year-to-date, but the two drugs will enter Phase 3 trials soon to further create certainty around Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s portfolio. Additionally, the firm also has other drugs such as NTLA-3001 in its portfolio which creates additional room to get a drug to the market. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA)’s management commented on its under-development drugs during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “In October, at The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting, we presented unprecedented positive results from our Phase II study of NTLA-2002 for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema. These results showed that a simple one-time infusion of NTLA-2002 offers patients the potential for a functional cure. For people living with HAE, current treatment options are limited to chronically administered prophylactic therapies to prevent or manage attacks, and the use of on-demand therapy to control breakthrough attacks. Overall, NTLA ranks 6th on our list of worst ARK stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of NTLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NTLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Halvorsen’s Top Stock Picks Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of Norwegian Billionaire Halvorsen's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Halvorsen's other top stock picks. Ole Andreas Halvorsen, the founder and CEO of Viking Global, has built one of the most respected names in the hedge fund world. Born in Norway, Halvorson graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from Williams College in 1986. He then later earned a postgraduate business degree from Stanford University. Having received his first taste of finance while working for Morgan Stanley, he’s part of an elite group of investors known as the “Tiger Cubs,” former protégés of hedge fund legend Julian Robertson, who went on to launch their own successful firms. Viking Global, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, has grown into an investment powerhouse. Back in 2023, the firm delivered an impressive $6 billion in returns for its investors, ranking just behind heavyweights like Citadel and TCI. Much of this success came from smart bets on big names. In the same year, Halvorsen decided to reopen Viking Global's long/short flagship fund to new investors. Over a decade ago, he had closed the fund, citing its size as a barrier to uncovering profitable trading opportunities. That said, Halvorsen isn't just about bullish bets. While long positions are Viking Global's bread and butter, the firm has also employed strategies that allow it to profit from short positions during turbulent market years like 2020 and 2022. The billionaire firmly believes that effective and profitable trading requires careful analysis and disciplined, long-term valuation. This philosophy has shaped Viking Global's portfolio into a balanced mix of both long-term and short-term investments. While his primary focus remains on long-term stakes in public and private companies, Halvorsen isn’t afraid to embrace "thoughtful risk-taking" to maximize returns. This balanced approach, combining strategic risk with a commitment to disciplined analysis, is at the heart of Viking Global’s success. This year, Viking’s funds have been making a strong comeback. Its hybrid fund, Viking Global Opportunities, which invests in both public stocks and private companies, earned a modest 1% return in the third quarter, trimming its year-to-date losses to 1.6%. Meanwhile, its private-asset fund, Viking Global Opportunities Drawdown, gained 4.2% for the quarter, bringing its total return for the year to 8.3%. After a rough second quarter, these results show Viking is back on track and making waves in the investment world. Overall, as of Q3 2024, Halvorsen’s 13F portfolio reflects a strong focus on the healthcare, finance, services, and technology sectors. The portfolio's total value stands at over $27.43 billion, marking a 1.05% increase compared to the previous quarter. For this analysis, we examined Viking Global's stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Viking Global's Q3 Stake: $1.13 billion Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), renowned for its iconic iPhone, Mac computers, and iPads, also derives significant revenue from its services segment, which includes Apple Pay, the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. On October 31, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a record fourth-quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year, fueled by strong demand for the iPhone 16 series, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. The company is also gearing up for the release of its 18.2 software update, which will introduce a range of AI-powered features and is expected to roll out to users soon. Additionally, the tech giant is expanding its services into new markets, with the highly anticipated launch of Apple Intelligence in China marking a significant step in its global growth strategy. UBS analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic stance on Apple’s iPhone 16, citing mixed demand signals and lukewarm interest in AI-related features, particularly outside of China. A UBS Evidence Lab survey revealed varying consumer sentiment across regions. In the U.S., purchase intent remained steady at 24%, while in China, it dipped to 17%, a 200-basis-point decline from 2023. However, Europe showed positive trends, with purchase intent rising in the U.K. by 200 basis points to 19% and in Germany by 300 basis points to 14%. Despite the tempered demand and skepticism toward AI features, UBS raised its global smartphone sell-in estimates to 1.21 billion units for 2024 and 1.24 billion units for 2025, indicating modest growth. On December 2, UBS maintained a $236 price target and a Neutral rating for AAPL shares, valuing the stock at 32 times its projected 2026 earnings per share of $7.49. In its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): “Alphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.” Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of Halvorsen's top stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Plastics Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other plastics stocks. The importance of plastics in modern society cannot be overstated. They play a vital role in various industries, including automotive, construction, food and beverage, and healthcare. Plastics are lightweight, durable, and versatile, making them essential for the production of a wide array of products that enhance our daily lives. Additionally, the plastics industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, contributing significantly to job creation and innovation. According to the Plastics Industry Association’s 2024 Size and Impact Report, the US plastics sector alone accounted for over 1 million jobs and generated $519.1 billion in shipments in 2023. This sector has shown resilience, with plastics manufacturing employment growing at a rate of 1.1% annually from 2013 to 2023, outpacing the overall manufacturing growth of 0.7% during the same period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Most Profitable Food Stocks To Invest In. Recent trends indicate a strong push towards sustainability within the plastics sector. Companies are increasingly investing in recycling technologies and circular economy initiatives to reduce waste and improve environmental outcomes. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global plastic recycling market was valued at $41.71 billion in 2023. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $61.56 billion by the end of the forecast period. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the production of plastic has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s, outpacing the growth of any other material. Global plastic production could reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. A significant portion of this plastic, around 36%, is used for packaging, including single-use items like food and beverage containers. Unfortunately, about 85% of these single-use plastics end up in landfills or as unmanaged waste, contributing to a growing environmental crisis. Demand for plastics is expected to remain high in the coming years. While limiting plastic production may seem beneficial for the environment, it could lead to unintended negative consequences for economies worldwide, particularly affecting those in developing regions that rely on affordable plastic products. The plastics industry is not only vital for economic stability but also plays a crucial role in addressing modern sustainability challenges. With ongoing investments in recycling and innovation, the plastics industry is expected to continue to thrive while adapting to changing consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. To compile our list of the 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now, we looked for the largest plastics companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best plastics stocks. From an initial pool of more than 20 plastics stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 8 best plastics stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). YAKOBCHUK VIACHESLAV/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and one of the largest integrated fuels, lubricants, and chemical companies in the world. The company is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. The company is making significant strides in the field of advanced recycling, which positions it as a promising investment opportunity for those interested in plastics. On November 21, 2024, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced a substantial investment of over $200 million to enhance its advanced recycling operations at its facilities in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas. This expansion will enhance the company’s ability to recycle hard-to-process plastics and divert them from landfills. The advanced recycling process transforms plastic waste into raw materials for various products, including fuels and high-performance plastics and chemicals. This method can handle types of plastic that traditional recycling cannot, helping to reduce waste and support a circular economy for plastics. With this investment, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will boost its annual recycling capacity to 500 million pounds, moving closer to its goal of reaching 1 billion pounds per year by 2027. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is also developing additional recycling projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company has advanced recycling customers in over 15 countries across various sectors, such as food-safe packaging and pet food, where demand is growing. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also advancing its technology-driven businesses, particularly with its innovative Proxxima thermoset resin. This new material is not only stronger and lighter than traditional options, but it also boasts superior corrosion resistance. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) estimates that the total addressable market for Proxxima could reach 5 million tons per year and a potential market value of $30 billion by 2030. Exxon Mobil Corporation’s (NYSE:XOM) strong market presence, combined with its strategic investments in advanced materials, positions it as a strong stock to consider for investors looking for growth in the plastics and materials sector. Overall, XOM ranks 1st on our list of the best plastics stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Neil Doak previously served as an assistant coach with Georgia. Former Ulster coach Neil Doak has been appointed as head coach of the Ireland U-20s for the 2025 Six Nations. The experienced former scrum-half was part of the ticket under Willie Faloon for this year’s World Cup in South Africa and now steps up to the top job. Doak will be assisted by former Connacht and Munster out-half Ian Keatley, ex-Connacht second row Andrew Browne and Blackrock College scrum guru Seamus Toomey who has been linked with a set-piece role with the IRFU. Ireland open their campaign against England in Cork and will warm up with a game against Italy on Friday week in St Mary’s RFC and against a Leinster Development XV on January 4. “It is a huge honour to take on the role of Ireland Men’s U-20s head coach, and a challenge I am massively excited about,” he said. "We have had a number of camps in the High Performance Centre and the application, hard work and commitment of the players has been really impressive. “We have a lot of work to get through in preparation for the U20 Six Nations, but the group are focused on building positively day-by-day and the upcoming matches against Italy and the Leinster Development XV over the Christmas and New Year period present us with an invaluable opportunity to build that cohesion and momentum. “We look forward to the challenges ahead, starting off with the visit of England to Virgin Media Park, where the Ireland U20s have received incredible support from the people of Cork in recent years, and we are determined to continue our excellent home record there and produce a performance we can be proud of.” Doak played cricket for Ireland at the same time as enjoying a career as a scrum-half for Ulster, before becoming a noted attack coach with his home province where he served as interim head coach while Les Kiss was still with Ireland, while he worked for Worcester Warriors between 2018 and 2020. He was part of Kiss’s coaching ticket for Ireland’s 2013 summer tour of the United States and Canada and has also worked at international level with Emerging Ireland in 2014 and Georgia in 2020 when he worked alongside IRFU performance director David Humphreys. In recent years, he’s been working in Ulster’s academy.

Title: Microsoft shareholders say NO to Bitcoin amid volatility concerns
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/microsoft-shareholders-say-no-to-bitcoin-amid-volatility-concerns/
Time Published: 2024-12-11T14:00:59Z
Full Content:
Could Bitcoin’s volatility outweigh its potential as a hedge against inflation? Microsoft shareholders have rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin [BTC], despite predictions of significant market growth. The proposal was led by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, who called for Microsoft to diversify its portfolio by allocating a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted BTC’s position as the seventh-largest global asset, with its market capitalization expected to surpass $2 trillion shortly and potentially reach over $200 trillion by 2045. However, concerns over volatility led to the board’s decision, supported by major institutional investors like Vanguard and BlackRock. Instead, Microsoft is focusing on AI innovation and is cautious about cryptocurrency investments, underscoring a strategic shift away from digital assets in favor of cutting-edge technological advancements. Remarking on the same, Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO said in a proxy statement, “AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, and we believe it will fundamentally bend the productivity curve for every individual, organization, and industry sector to help us address some of our most pressing global challenges.” Nadella added, “We know Microsoft will only succeed if the world is fundamentally succeeding. We are focused on ensuring the world benefits from the broad technological shift to AI, while mitigating its risks.” The proposal, suggested by the National Center for Public Policy Research, recommended allocating 1% of Microsoft’s assets, approximately $784 million, to BTC as a hedge against inflation. Despite the proposal’s innovative approach, concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility and potential risks to financial stability led to the board’s decision. Institutional investors like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, who collectively own about 70% of Microsoft shares, supported the board’s position, balancing a cautious view with their broader crypto interests. This highlights that Microsoft’s focus remains on stability, with a preference for predictability over risk. BTC’s volatility, substantial market fluctuations, and the risk of significant losses—such as its 70% decline in 2022—may have influenced Microsoft’s decision to reject the proposal. Additionally, the strategic use of cash flows to support operations and future investments is critical, and liquidating Bitcoin during market downturns could lead to losses. Furthermore, ongoing regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies adds an extra layer of complexity. As a result, Microsoft remains focused on low-risk assets like treasury bonds to maintain long-term stability and sustainable growth. As expected, Microsoft’s decision to reject BTC investment faced significant criticism and sarcasm from the crypto community, as highlighted by Bitcoin Archive in its recent X post. Source: Bitcoin Archive/X Saylor too jumped in and said, “In 5 years, they’ll understand. Everyone buys Bitcoin at the price they deserve.#BTC doesn’t wait. It simply transfers wealth to those who see.” Despite this, several supporters came to Microsoft’s defense, emphasizing the company’s focus on long-term stability and strategic caution.

Title: Why Is Tesla (TSLA) the Best Self-Driving Technology Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-best-self-121627093.html
Time Published: 2024-12-11T12:16:27Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Self-Driving Technology Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The autonomous driving industry is, along with machine learning and image processing, one of the earliest adopters of artificial intelligence. While the post-2022 hype surrounding AI has led to the technology catching the general public’s attention, what ChatGPT debuted was a subset of AI called generative artificial intelligence. Other forms of AI, such as machine learning, have been employed for far longer, and as we alluded to above, one form is autonomous driving. Autonomous driving uses machine learning to compute data gathered through sensors or cameras on a car. The machine learning algorithms are trained using vast amounts of data already gathered. Several firms already have working autonomous driving platforms. These include Elon Musk’s car company, Google Waymo, and GM’s Cruise platform. Yet, even though all of them are autonomous driving platforms, they also represent a key division in the industry. Before we get to the biggest controversy in the autonomous driving industry, it’s important to first get a sense of the industry’s value. According to research from Mordor Intelligence, as of 2024, the industry is worth a cool $41 billion. By 2029, the firm expects it to touch $144 billion by growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75%. Analysts believe that one of the biggest drivers of the autonomy industry will be autonomous ridesharing. As per McKinsey, 56% of consumers surveyed in 2022 indicated that they would be willing to share self-driving vehicles provided that they did not increase travel time and cut down costs by 20%. The respondents also wanted Level 4 autonomy in their future cars, which indicates that the market for self-driving vehicles exists among consumers. But what about businesses? After all, the corporate sector only invests in technologies if it’s confident about making a return and generating operating efficiencies. On this front, additional research from McKinsey shows that self-driving vehicle software could post margins of up to 15% while hardware could have margins of 10%. Autonomous vehicle services create margins of 14%, believes the research firm, as it adds that 96% of businesses surveyed “saw strategic partnerships as crucial to autonomous-vehicle development, and more than half (56 percent) thought the relationship between OEMs and end users (such as logistics carriers) is already changing.” Cycling back to the division in the autonomous driving industry, this has divided the sector between using cameras to gather visual data or using LiDAR sensors instead. On the former front, Elon Musk created quite a bit of turmoil in 2019 when he announced that firms that use LiDAR for autonomous driving were unwise. Musk persisted with his opinion in a later interview given at an Axel Springer event. He explained that: “We believe just cameras are the way to go. We don’t use LiDAR at all. The entire road network is designed for passive optical, it’s essentially vision. So, in order to make a car drive properly, you have to solve vision. And, at the point at which you solve vision, you really don’t need any other instruments. Like a careful driver, a human driver can drive with an extremely good track record. Unlike a human, the computer does not get tired. It has 360 degree surround cameras. It’s got three cameras pointing forward. So it’s like being able to see with the eyes in the back of the head. So it’s really, vision is the way to go. There’s some value to active optical for wavelength that’s occlusion penetrating. So it can see through fog, or rain, or dust. But it. has to be high resolution. Such that you can rely on, for example radar at roughly four millimeter wavelength. This is good for occlusion penetration. But it needs to have enough resolution to know you braking for a real object and not just a bridge, or a manhole cover, or something like that.” However, while Musk is convinced that LiDAR isn’t worthwhile for autonomous driving, executives at Google’s Waymo business beg to differ. At a developer event in 2019, Waymo’s Principal Scientist Drago Anguelov commented “You can imagine doing driving just with cameras, but you would need the best camera systems to really handle it. So that’s a very big bet that you can achieve it. And it’s very, very risky, and it’s not necessary.” He added that his firm had better data courtesy of LiDAR which helps it “build the right simulation environments.” CTO Dmitri Dolgov shared that using LiDAR was “all about taking the best of both worlds and combining them in an intelligible way to have the most capable and the safest system that you can have.” So, while Musk and the autonomous driving industry battle it out, we decided to look at which autonomous driving stocks hedge funds are piling into. The industry hasn’t performed too well in 2024 as a broader automotive and EV slowdown has meant that orders for self-driving equipment providers have slowed down. The slowdown has led to some stocks losing as much as 58% year-to-date, and as you read on, you’ll understand why. For our list of the best self-driving technology stocks, we ranked the holdings of Global X’s autonomy ETF with significant exposure to autonomous driving by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2024 and picked out the top stocks. For an alternative list that focuses on the best autonomous driving car companies, please visit 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q3 2024: 99 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a leading player in the autonomous driving industry and one of the hottest firms in the sector. Its FSD assisted driving platform is among the industry leaders in America, and FSD’s success is also baked into the firm’s hypothesis. Through FSD and its Cybercabs, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to unlock new markets and diversify away from being an EV manufacturer. Consequently, the firm has to deliver on these fronts or see trouble with the share price as was evident in October after the stock fell by 9% after Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Cybercab event failed to impress investors with the specifics. However, the stock is up by a whopping 52% since the November election due to CEO Elon Musk’s proximity with President-elect Donald Trump and the market’s belief that this can generate positive catalysts for Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The firm also benefits from having 1.3 billion miles of data to train autonomous systems and computing resources to crunch its algorithms. Baron Funds mentioned Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “As discussed in the Fund’s prior shareholder letter, the fears about Tesla’s products were misplaced. Instead of the company being exclusively dependent on limited vehicle models and software advancement, the company announced it will more rapidly introduce products that appeal to a wider audience. It also demonstrated that its price reductions were the result of efficiencies rather than only to spur demand. Margins exceeded expectations. And the company’s integration of its hardware with proprietary AI software should facilitate full self-driving capabilities and subsequent new revenue streams. This integration of hardware with software creates a dynamic growth company as it more fully explores its potential with Optimus, humanoid robotics. The combination of these catalysts resulted in Tesla’s stock increasing meaningfully and rapidly in the second half of the quarter. This stock price momentum has continued into the next period.” Overall, TSLA ranks 3rd on our list of best self-driving technology stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
