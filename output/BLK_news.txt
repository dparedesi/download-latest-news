Title: Ethereum Price Could Be Primed For Another 100% Move After Printing Capitulation Candle
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-primed-for-100-move/
Time Published: 2025-02-07T17:00:02Z

Ethereum’s price action in the past seven days has led to the creation of a capitulation candle that might send it on another surge within the next eight to twelve weeks. This capitulation candle caught the attention of crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who noted an interesting repeating capitulation pattern for Ethereum. According to technical analysis by Ted Pillows, Ethereum has printed a capitulation candle in early 2025, just as it did in the first quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. TedPillows’ analysis highlights that the Ethereum price has undergone three major capitulation events in the past two years, all of which led to substantial price rebounds. Particularly, these capitulations have taken place in the weekly candlestick timeframe, where the Ethereum price witnessed intense selling pressure throughout the week. However, historical price playout shows that these capitulations have often marked the bottom before a massive price rally. The first of such capitulations occurred in Q1 2024 and eventually led to a 100% rally over the next three months, with the Ethereum price reaching $3,950. The second capitulation took place in Q3 2024, leading to a similar upswing. With Ethereum now experiencing another capitulation moment in early 2025, the analyst suggests that the pattern is set to repeat. He believes that Ethereum is once again forming a market bottom, setting the stage for an aggressive upward move. If Ethereum follows its previous trajectory, the next eight to twelve weeks could bring a significant price increase, even as the leading altcoin currently struggles around $2,700. A 90%-100% pump after the recent capitulation would push the Ethereum price past key resistance levels and above its current all-time high. TedPillows’ analysis suggests that Ethereum’s ultimate price target following this capitulation could reach as high as $8,000. However, it is likely to encounter significant resistance near $3,950, a level that has historically triggered rejections in past capitulation cycles. Should Ethereum struggle to break through this barrier again, a temporary pullback could be on the horizon before any sustained move higher. Meanwhile, Spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting heavy inflows despite Ethereum’s price downturn. Institutional investors appear to be capitalizing on the dip and increasing their ETH holdings in anticipation of a broader market rebound. Spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded $513.8 million in inflows in the last six trading days, with BlackRock leading the charge by acquiring $424.1 million worth of ETH. This steady accumulation from institutional holders suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and could lay the foundation for the projected 100% surge in the next eight to twelve months. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,725, down by 4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Weekly Recap: Crypto Debanking in the Spotlight
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2025/02/07/weekly-recap-crypto-debanking-in-the-spotlight
Time Published: 2025-02-07T16:59:39Z

It was a busy week in crypto featuring important product launches, fevered debate around Ethereum, movement on stablecoin legislation, and high-profile Congressional hearings on “debanking.” David Sacks, the Crypto and AI Czar, held a high-profile press conference with Senate leadership, as Senator Hagerty, of Tennessee, introduced a new stablecoin bill. The proposal, which outlines an oversight regime for stablecoin issuance, builds on a bill that passed the House last year but fell in the Senate. It’s more likely to pass this year, now that Republicans are in control. CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton had the news. The Senate also held hearings on the co-ordinated policy of institutions like the FDIC to deny financial services to crypto companies during the Biden years (aka debanking). Nathan McCauley, CEO Anchorage Digital, an institutional custodian, testified (and also wrote about his experience on CoinDesk). Consensys founder Joe Lubin said his company had been debanked twice as well, Ian Allison reported. Ondo Finance introduced a new tokenization blockchain, in readiness for an expected wave of institutional interest in RWAs. Kris Sandor and Helene Braun had the story. Trump-backed World Liberty Financial immediately bought $470,000 worth of ONDO, the platform’s governance token. Kris Sandor and Francisco Rodrigues reported on that. The week’s other big launch came from Berachain, which debuted a mainnet and a 79 million-strong airdrop, Shaurya Malwa reported. At the time of writing, BERA’s market cap was already more than $800 million. Shaurya also provided a prescient analysis of XRP price, well ahead of its decline by analyzing trading patterns. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy rebranded, dropping the “Micro” but not the commitment to purchasing as much bitcoin as possible. Soon, James Van Straten reported that BlackRock had taken a 5% ownership in the company. News around Ethereum was less rosy, as has been the case for a few months now. JPMorgan said ether has underperformed because of competition from rivals like Solana, and because it lacks a compelling narrative (like bitcoin), Will Canny reported. But Ethereum did move forward on its Pectra upgrade and its cheerleaders run deep, even on Wall Street, Margaux Nijkerk said. So better days may be ahead (Eric Trump certainly tweeted an endorsement). Bitcoin is called "digital gold" by some, but outside of it, the actual precious metal moves cryptocurrencies too. Gold's historic run has seen prices outperforming the traditional market, taking gold-backed crypto with it. Francisco Rodrigues highlighted how and why tokens like PAXG and XAUT were among the best-performing tokens this year, outperforming even the "digital gold," due to the bullion's rally. Finally, in an important case for internet privacy, Alexey Pertsev, one of the developers of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer, was released from jail pending an appeal. He had been sentenced to 64 months inside last year. Happy weekend, all. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. PwC highlights that the automotive semiconductor market reached $76 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $117 billion by 2028, driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Power semiconductors, particularly those utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are expected to reach $6 billion, comprising 18% of the market by 2028. Meanwhile, automotive system-on-chip (SoC) revenue was $7 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR through 2028, supporting real-time data processing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, prompting major economies to pursue self-sufficiency. By 2027, approximately $400 billion in government funding is expected to be allocated to semiconductor initiatives. The US has already awarded $29.5 billion in grants and $25.1 billion in loans, with total investments projected to reach $348 billion by 2030. The European Union has allocated $46 billion for incentives, while China has invested over $190 billion through its National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund and local initiatives. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have also introduced tax incentives and subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor production. The demand for custom ICs tailored to specific applications is surging, especially in data centers, video processing, and network security. By 2028, the market for data center custom ICs is expected to reach $24 billion. AI is a critical growth driver for the semiconductor industry, requiring GPUs, accelerators, and HBM. The AI-specific silicon market is forecasted to reach $150 billion by 2028.

JP Morgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Nvidia, noting that past innovation cycles suggest that efficiency and technology improvements drive further adoption and innovation. Analysts led by Harlan Sur said that after the launch of the DeepSeek R1 large language model last week, investors were concerned regarding the intermediate and long-term effects for AI semiconductor spending given the Chinese startup's claim regarding their compute efficiency in terms of cost and performance for training/inferencing AI models. However, the analysts noted that despite the impressive cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s training and inference, several questions remain unanswered, including the complete training costs for R1 and the extent of reliance on larger open-source foundation models developed earlier. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the chip stocks in focus amid tech selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock increased its ownership stake in Strategy (MSTR) to 5% during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to its latest SEC filing. The investment firm held approximately 11.2 million shares of Strategy, having acquired roughly 1.8 million shares during the period, based on data from Yahoo Finance. The New York-based asset management giant, overseeing over $11.6 trillion in client assets, is among the top shareholders of Strategy, alongside Capital International Investors, Vanguard Group, Morgan Stanley, and State Street. As of the latest data, Capital International Investors and Vanguard Group are Strategy’s largest shareholders. Interestingly, Vanguard, which has long been skeptical of Bitcoin and crypto assets, holds large positions in companies that are bullish on Bitcoin, like Strategy, Riot Platforms, and MARA Holdings, formerly known as Marathon Digital. BlackRock also holds shares in MARA Holdings (MARA). As of September 30, 2024, Larry Fink’s company owned around 45,2 million shares of MARA, representing a 13% stake in the company. This makes the firm one of the largest institutional shareholders of the Bitcoin miner. BlackRock’s most recent disclosure of MSTR holdings comes after Michael Saylor’s company rebranded to Strategy, positioning itself as the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury company while continuing its development in AI-enabled business intelligence. Strategy’s perpetual preferred stock (STRK), which debuted on Nasdaq Thursday, closed up 2% on volume exceeding 650,000 shares. The stock is showing further strength in pre-market trading, up 5%. MSTR was down about 3% at Thursday’s close but is up 1.5% in pre-market trading. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Tether's brain-to-text initiative promises digital communication solutions for people with neurological conditions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoin issuer Tether is advancing its AI initiatives with a focus on translating brain signals into speech. In a Feb. 6 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether Data’s research and development (R&D) team has built an electrocorticography (ECoG) plugin. This technology interprets neural signals, forming the foundation for brain-to-text communication. Initial tests confirmed its ability to generate syllables from brain activity. The next step is the development of a model that can construct complete sentences. Tether’s AI models aim to assist individuals with speech impairments. Through ECoG implants, users could communicate digitally by converting brain signals into text. The models will also run on edge devices such as smartphones, ensuring data remains private. According to Ardoino: “These models will serve as backbone for future system that would allow someone who has lost speech and has an ECoG implant to speak digitally once again.” Last year, Blackrock Neurotech, a company backed by Tether, restored speech in a patient who had nearly lost communication ability. Ardoino said that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could evolve into mainstream consumer products within two decades, potentially offering life-changing solutions for those affected by paralysis and neurological conditions. These initiatives are part of Tether’s growing involvement in AI. Earlier this week, the company introduced several AI-powered applications, including a Bitcoin wallet assistant, a translation tool, and a voice assistant. These solutions prioritize user security and privacy by operating directly on personal devices. Beyond AI, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has reached a major milestone. Ardoino revealed that the digital asset now serves 400 million users in emerging markets, including Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, and Brazil. According to him: “USDt reached 400 million users across emerging markets. Digital dollar and financial inclusion.” CryptoSlate data shows that USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, with a market capitalization exceeding $141 billion. According to DeFillama data, it controls roughly 63% of the stablecoin market. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. Armed with a classical education and an eye for news, Andjela dove head deep into the crypto industry in 2018 after spending years covering politics. Follow us on X for instant crypto news and insights updates. Tether's CEO said that the company prioritizes interoperability and partnerships with various networks for USDT's growth. The apps are part of Tehter's broader push to develop open-source, multimodal AI models for real-world use cases. Hagerty will introduce a bill to create clear rules for stablecoin transfers in the US, potentially fostering growth to a stagnated industry. Tether's gold and Bitcoin stash generated $5 billion in unrealized profits, roughly 40% of last year's amount.

Title: Even US Messaging Outlet RFE/RL Having Trouble Prettying Up Trump Planning to Buy Ukraine Rare Earths Empty Bag

It’s amusing to see a US influence operator, RFL/RL, trying to preserve an image of accuracy while carrying official water. Here, the case in point is Trump’s promotion of the idea that the US could continue to arm Ukraine if Ukraine mortgaged its future by paying the US via ownership or other concessions of its rare earths deposits, or as Trump put it, “rare earth” and one presumes other strategic materials. Here we have Trump again proving himself to be the truest follower of the Kamala Harris exhortation, “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” Here the “what has been” includes what is. In this case, it’s that Ukraine has bupkis in the way of rare earths. Worse, the media has been simply parroting what Trump said as if Ukraine really had these goodies, as opposed to engaging in some throat clearing. So it sure looks like Trump is prepared to send Ukraine more arms in return for an empty bag. Yours truly is not expert in these matters.Yet it was pretty obvious Trump and press transcriptionists were out over their skis on “rare earth”. One has to think the Chinese and Russians and many many others are sniggering at yet another display of imperial incompetence. In fairness to RFE/RL, they did go to the trouble of making clear that Trump scheme and mainstream media amplification are barmycakes, and even found a source that could thinly dignify the Trump, erm, misapprehension. We are reposting the entire RFE/RL piece in full below, but here are the key bits. Please note we’ve posted charts and links in comments from Statista that come to essentially the same findings as the RFE/RL source: Those who are not math challenged may have noticed that the Thailand deposits are a full four orders of magnitude smaller than those of China. As Dima of Military Summary is wont to say, “That’s a lot!” And of course, that Ukraine is nowhere on this list. RFE/RL also kindly provided the production ranking: It’s surprising to see the US rank as #2, particularly after all the handwringing about the US having abandoned rare earths mining and processing. For instance, from a 2019 article in Mining.com, How the US lost the plot on rare earths: Unfortunately, the United States Military and dozens of high-tech North American companies are as dependent on China for their rare earth elements as the United Launch Alliance is on Russian-made rockets… Without rare earths mined and processed in China, America would be unable to manufacture military hardware – rare earths are great multipliers they are used in making everything from computer monitors and permanent magnets to lasers, guidance control systems and jet engines. There is no substitute and no other supply source is available other than China. Civilian uses of rare earths would also be put in jeopardy. This includes rare earth elements incorporated into electric vehicle motors, computer chips, fiber-optic cables, flat-screen televisions, wind power turbines and nuclear power, just to name a few uses. In 2010, we posted US Faces Substantial Obstacles to Increasing Rare Earths Production. It discussed both MIT Technology Review and New York Times articles on why the US had ceded rare earths production to China despite having adequate supplies: In fact, the while the [MIT] article does discuss US versus foreign engineering expertise in rare earths mining, it describes in some detail how difficult rare earths mining is in general (more accurately, not the finding the materials part, but separating them out) and the considerable additional hurdles posed by doing it in a non-environmentally destructive manner. Thus the rub is not simply acquiring certain bits of technological know-how, but also breaking further ground in reducing environmental costs. And this issue has frequently been mentioned in passing in accounts of why rare earth production moved to China in the first place. It’s nasty, and advanced economies weren’t keen to do the job. China was willing to take the environmental damage. For instance, the New York Times points out: China feels entitled to call the shots because of a brutally simple environmental reckoning: It currently controls most of the globe’s rare earths supply not just because of geologic good fortune, although there is some of that, but because the country has been willing to do dirty, toxic and often radioactive work that the rest of the world has long shunned. Forgive this digression, but it seemed useful to provide a mini-primer in case this Trump proposal has a longer half-life than it ought to. I am mystified at the US production figures being as high as RFE/RL shows in light of the upset about the US abandonment of the market as recently as 2019. Was there indeed a technology breakthrough? Did Biden provide an environmental waiver that went under the radar? So back to RFE/RL, which provided an almost deadpan statement after the first of the two rare earths charts: Ukraine has substantial amounts of rare earth minerals, according to the Ukrainian Geological Survey. So the same Ukraine propaganda machine that brought us the Ghost of Kiev and most recently, the Trump-amplified claim that Russia has suffered a million deaths in the Ukraine war has apparently been treated as truthful when as far as I can tell, no reputable source on mineral reserves is buying what it is selling. Many commentators have tried to burnish the Trump remarks by saying he likely meant lithium (which is not a rare earth) and other strategic minerals. Wellie, as various commentators have already pointed out, Ukraine has four major lithium deposits, two of which are under Russia’s control. The severity of gnashing of teeth when Russia recently captured the second of these two areas suggests that it represents the largest supply. Readers are encouraged to pipe up. Ukraine has a lot of frackable gas, but over 80% is in Kharkiv or other eastern oblasts. Iron ore and coal are presumably mainly in the east since that’s where the Donbass heavy industry grew up. Ukraine’s black earth (its famed fantastic soil) is both east and west of the Dnieper, but looking at the distribution and type of crops farmed, my impression is that it’s disproportionately in the east (as in the land area east of the Dnieper is roughly a third of the country, but the black earth concentration in the east could plausibly be 50% of the total). And any Ukraine mortgaging of these assets is subject to prior claims, such as nearly 30% of the farmland being owned by oligarchs and/or the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. And if you think Westerners will come out ahead in a tangle with Ukraine’s oligarchs and the Banderite muscle they hire (as in specialists in the worst sort of torture), I have a bridge I’d like to sell you. Another aside: it’s curious how Trump’s inexact patter repeatedly leads observers to interpret what he must have meant, as if trying to make sense of what a non-native speaker of the language is saying. This turns Trump communication into what Marshall McLuhan called a hot medium, like radio, where you hear words and then often add your own visual images. Hot media are active and engaging. Cold media like TV are passive because little is left to the imagination. But to the big question of where Trump might be going with this “arms for minerals” talk. Here I have to differ with the Duran duo of Alexander Mercouris and Alex Christoforu. If I am representing them correctly, they see proposed bargain as Trump reducing his Ukraine dealings to a transaction. They contend that is being a big downgrade from the Collective West “we’re all in because democracy” patter. That may have been the US position but it was never Trump’s position. Trump campaigned on the claims that the war would never had happened had he been re-elected in 2020 and he could do a deal to wind it up within 24 hours of assuming office. He never was on board with the “Zelensky as Churchill” and other conflict sales patter. Trump’s willingness to entertain continuing to supply Ukraine with more materiel, even on supposedly paid basis, contradicts the former Trump promise to end the war quickly. And it’s a bastard cousin of the Ursula von der Leyen scheme to fund the war by floating bonds backed by the frozen Russian assets. It’s a a very shaky pretext for pretending to lend to Ukraine when the security interest, as they say in the business, can’t be perfected. In reality, any “loans” are subject to eventually being substantially or entirely written down. But the fact that Trump floated this idea does not mean he is serious. It may simply be an effort to create another option, that the US still has a way to continue to supply weapons to Ukraine that Trump can make look palatable to the American public. The reason for doing that would be to try to bolster the weak US position in bargaining with Russia. That’s consistent with the NBC report of divisions in the Trump ranks on Ukraine: that some Trump insiders, like Mike Waltz and Keith Kellogg, want to double down on the failing Biden strategy of pumping more arms into Ukraine to achieve the Mission Impossible of improving their battlefield position before sitting down to talk. By RFE/RL staff. Cross posted from OilPrice There’s already a flurry of diplomatic wrangling, backchannel talks, and public posturing ongoing between Washington, Moscow, and Kyiv, to figure out how to halt the nearly 3-year-old all-out Russian war on Ukraine. Now add this to the mix: U.S. President Donald Trump wants to condition future U.S. aid to Ukraine on getting more access to the country’s valuable “rare earth” minerals — minerals that are in increasing demand for batteries, computers, smart phones, and electric cars, not to mention weaponry. “We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,” he told reporters on February 3. “I want to have security of rare earth. We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,” he said. The reaction from Ukraine? We’re not opposed. “We are open to the fact, that all of this can be developed together, along with our partners who can help us protect our lands,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Kyiv. “This is absolutely fair. I talked about this in September when we met with President Trump.” So What Is A Rare Earth Mineral, Anyway? Rare earths are a class of about 17 minerals — for example, yttrium, cerium, lanthanum — that are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth’s surface. They’re in increasing demand because of their use in high-tech products. The ongoing race to make batteries smaller and lighter, and more powerful and longer-lasting, involves the use of rare earth minerals. Defense industries also need the minerals for weaponry and related technology. Other rare earth minerals are used as chemical catalysts in magnets, computer drives, or generators. The biggest hurdle for rare earth extraction is that you have to dig up a lot of soil to get an adequate amount of the minerals because they’re in such trace amounts. And then you have to separate out and refine them before you can employ them in technology or machinery. Ukraine has substantial amounts of rare earth minerals, according to the Ukrainian Geological Survey. It also has less-rare, more abundant minerals that are also coveted for use in technology and cutting-edge industries: lithium, for example, which is used widely in batteries of all sorts, and titanium, which is used in airplane manufacturing. Some estimates say the country’s lithium deposits could be valued at billions of dollars. Trump may also have been referring to these minerals; he did not make that clear. For the record, Ukraine also has far greater deposits of other, more common mineral resources — coal, iron ore, oil and gas – which provide major revenues for the country and also major investment opportunities. Many of those resources are located in parts of Ukraine that are occupied by Russian forces — and may ultimately end up under total Russian control. So Why Does Trump Want Them? The race to locate, secure, develop, and monetize rare earth minerals has been accelerating for years now. Estimates of the minerals in North America stand at about 3.6 million tons in United States and more than 14 million tons in Canada, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and the United States is the second-largest producer in the world after China. Australia and Burma are other major producers. But in 2023, China, which produces about 60 percent of all rare earths in the world and processes nearly 90 percent, rattled global markets when it announced a ban on rare earth extraction and production. That set off alarm bells in the West, where lawmakers and policymakers worried that Western technology would be crippled by a lack of supply of rare earth minerals. China further jolted the discussion on February 3 — the same day Trump spoke to reporters — when it slapped tariffs on a range of U.S. goods in retaliation for tariffs announced over the weekend by Trump. Beijing also imposed export controls on tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, and molybdenum: critical minerals that are important in high-tech manufacturing but are not categorized as rare earths. Can Trump Really Condition Aid To Ukraine On Access To Rare Earths? Probably. Ukraine is heavily dependent on the United States for the weaponry and equipment that has kept Kyiv in the fight against the Russian invasion. As of September, Congress had appropriated $174.2 billion for Ukraine-related purposes, with the majority of that going to Defense Department and defense-related accounts, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump, who has made ending the Ukraine conflict a top priority, and his advisers have signaled that part of the negotiations will include enticements and pressure to get Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Conditioning future U.S. aid on Ukrainian concessions is key to that; convincing Kyiv to give U.S. investors more access to rare earths and critical minerals could be a big part of the calculus. Without U.S. weaponry, Ukraine’s military would buckle amid the grinding onslaughts from the bigger and better-equipped Russian troops. How long before its defenses would collapse outright is unclear. It’s not the first time that Trump conditioned U.S. weaponry on concessions from Ukraine, specifically President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During his first presidency, Trump was impeached by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives after a phone call with Zelenskyy. In the call, Trump appeared to say he would unfreeze U.S. aid if Zelenskyy reopened an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company whose board included the son of Joe Biden, at the time a former vice president. Lawyers argued a U.S. president has no legal right to withhold funding that has been appropriated by Congress. Trump, who denied any wrongdoing and described the conversation as a “perfect phone call,” was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. This time around, Republicans control both chambers of Congress so it’s unlikely there will be strong congressional pushback on conditioning U.S. aid. Moreover, Trump and his advisers have embraced a more muscular approach to White House decision-making, arguing Congress has less involvement in executive branch decisions. What Does The Kremlin Think About All This? Russia also has substantial rare earth and critical mineral reserves, though its production capacity lags substantially behind China and other countries. Broadly speaking, anything that complicates life for Ukraine is seen as a good thing for Moscow, which knows U.S. weaponry has kept Kyiv in the fight. Russia, which has the upper hand on the battlefield, is doing its own positioning ahead of potential peace negotiations. That includes flattery from President Vladimir Putin. One of the Trump White House bargaining chips has also been the threat to flood Ukraine with even more U.S. weaponry — which would be bad for Russian troops and the Kremlin. Asked by reporters about Trump’s rare earth comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it appeared the White House was looking to make Ukraine pay for aid from Washington. “This is clearly an offer to Ukraine to buy U.S. assistance,” he said. Trump is potentially making another huge blunder here. The first was the awful “Trail of Tears” plan for the Gazans. Any further aid to Ukraine after the last tranche of Biden’s expires (probably in a month or so) ties Trump to this debacle. It will be his baby, and the Dems can rightfully point the finger at him when the videos of helicopters leaving the US embassy with natives clinging to the landing gear come out in 2028. True with a sorta of kaviat – knowing a lot of Trump supports from family, IMO the “what’s in it for us” mentally is noticeable among those I know. Meaning they could care less about ending the war in Ukraine because millions are dead and dying, but because Ukraine has gotten hundreds of billions, while they got nothing from it. But if they get something out of it or at least think they benefit (oil from Syria in return for American boots on the ground thats smart!) they tend to be generally OK with that. So Trump being able to say America will get Lithium as payment for continued support, they might see as shrewd vs the dumb Dems. One possible explanation, and I only researched a little, is that the US is deficient in many of the 17 rare earths, except two https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/critical-metals-investing/rare-earth-investing/rare-earth-metal-production/ states all the US production is “neodymium and praseodymium” from one California mine. The original source is: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/rare-earths-statistics-and-information which says, for example, that US scandium production has been zero since 1969. Never mind the exotic stuff, recent Chinese moves about tungsten supply will limit the shell production of the west permanently. In the 70’s I met people picking up sugar bags of wolfram up Cape York and this should make it viable again if China persists. Many commentators have tried to burnish the Trump remarks by saying he likely meant lithium (which is not a rare earth) and other strategic minerals. Wellie, as various commentators have already pointed out, Ukraine has four major lithium deposits, two of which are under Russia’s control. The severity of gnashing of teeth when Russia recently captured the second of these two areas suggests that it represents the largest supply. Readers are encouraged to pipe up. I don’t think Trump really knows, or cares, much about Ukrainian lithium, rare earth, or other mineral reserves (except that they exist, and are worth XYZ bucks). I believe he just used the term as buzzword. He likes to sound smart, and this surely made him sound smarter than his “super-hypersonic” improvisation. The four oblasts (and Crimea) annexed by Russia contain an estimated 50% of all mineral wealth in the Ukraine. Another 20% to 25% is in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast. I don’t expect Russia to detour but they could get an easy 5% of the mineral wealth in the form of metal deposits by just taking a bite out of the east side of that oblast. Getting to the Dnieper/Dnipro river and/or besieging Dnipro would net them another 10%. The only other oblast that Russia might end up controlling wold be Kharkiv but that is mainly gas reserves Found this. Ukraine has commercially viable deposits of 117 of the 120 commercially most used metals and 32 out of 34 classed as critical by the EU. 117 out of 120 metals. Biggest commercially viable rare earth deposits in Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Cherkasy. Only Cherkasy is not territory that Russia gets to control (unless it takes over the entire Ukraine).

In this case it appears to be mined as ore, not processed to finished product. The data source for the graph is found here on document page 168: World Mining Data 2022 The data are actually Rare Earth Ore-Content. Once ore is mined it may be ground and processed in a mill with chemicals to produce concentrate. It’s not uncommon for ore concentrate to be sold internationally for final processing. More effort needed to confirm, but this appears to align with Yves’ statement about the US not wanting the environmental damage associated with rare earths (while being deceiving about what’s being produced). I remember being in a department head (head of the whole depot on the Navy base) meeting where when the department head queried a senior lead engineer about getting a robotic painting project done on time, on cost (to which the engineer replied, sure!), he stated that he had higher odds getting his cat to to stack wood on his wood pile. I think that cat will stack multiple wood piles and then randomly type out some Shakespeare before Ukraine makes any refined REE for Trump. Researchers at WVU have developed a process to extract rare earth elements and critical minerals from acid mine drainage. Right now it is a very small scale operation but there is a lot of acid mine drainage throughout the nation that this process might be useful at remediating. https://wvwri.wvu.edu/news/2023/09/13/wvu-s-water-research-institute-receives-additional-11mm-for-rare-earth-research My already probably a year old prediction of how the conflict will end: triumphantly liberated West Ukraine, to be looted till nothing’s left by the West; and the triumphantly protected new Russian People’s Republics of the east, to be looted till nothing’s left by Putin & Friends. In that context it doesn’t matter which and how much resources there really are for Zelenskyy to give up – the deal will be “all known, presumed, and possible” in perpetuity. The local oligarchy will be paid to keep the status quo (… reminds me of Afghanistan and that chopper that couldn’t take off because of all the cash weighing it down…) and whatever’s left of the local plebs will have the sovereign choice of either working for minimal wage for the new bosses, or not working at all (and starving to death). In other words the difference between the Western and the Eastern parts will be only in the wallpaper and western media coverage (West good! East evil!). As such, I’d welcome any and all arguments why and how things can turn up less bleak and medieval… I just don’t see any. Your email address will not be published.

Title: The secretive world of Wall Street technology is opening up like never before

Time Published: 2025-02-07T09:01:01Z

Software developers at Morgan Stanley are accustomed to pushback when pitching to build something new. "I tell technologists all the time, if you're building something and it is not a source of competitive advantage, you have to wonder: 'Is this already outside? Should I be using it if I'm not using it? Is there something or a gap that I should be improving and contributing back my improvement?'" Dov Katz, a managing director helping oversee the bank's tens of thousands of developers, told Business Insider. "And only then should you build something net new," he said. Katz was talking about prioritizing open-source technology, which is nonproprietary software that allows developers from all over, including rival companies, to view, collaborate on, and modify the code behind it. The open source-first approach and collaborative attitude is a departure from the hypercompetitive and proprietary nature that Wall Street has come to be known for. But Katz's stance is part of a sea change in the industry as banks, hedge funds, and asset-management firms find more reasons to open up. While revealing secrets is alien to the Wall Street DNA, finance firms have been shedding those conservative notions over the past few years. In that shift, financial institutions are growing to become contributors to open source, not just consumers. As such, the amount of intellectual property flowing into open-source hosting platforms and the number of contributions from financial services professionals continue to rise. Last year, financial services workers contributed more than 750,000 commits, or changes, to GitHub, one of the main platforms for hosting open-source projects, the Fintech Open Source Foundation, an open-source nonprofit for financial services, found. That's a 55% increase from 2021 levels. Around the same time, financial companies from JPMorgan to BlackRock and Man Group also released internal platforms for open source. Wall Street's embrace of open source could be coming at a good time. Global technology spending in banking ballooned to $650 billion in 2023 — roughly the GDP of Belgium or Sweden — an October report from McKinsey said. Despite the steady 9%-a-year average increase in spending, bank shareholders and analysts are still questioning when they're going to see quantifiable value, the report said. Scrutiny comes as finance firms carve out even more resources for artificial intelligence, which can be a costly endeavor. One of the main upsides to leveraging open source is cost efficiency: sharing the burden of development while freeing up engineers to work on other tasks. It could allow firms to be nimbler in the long run, cutting down on their yearslong road maps because outside contributors can make fixes to codebases and introduce features. "Otherwise, you're just building tech debt forever. You're going to have to support something forever if you're building it yourself," Katz said. Goldman Sachs' chief data officer, Neema Raphael, has witnessed this cultural shift over his more than two decades at the bank. Attitudes went "from almost very secretive, we're going to keep everything within" to accepting the benefits of open source with some caution, he said. "Then finally, to like, 'OK, we should actually be a player in this space in the sense that we should also contribute to open source'" and get leverage from that, he added There's momentum at senior levels, Katz said, for engineers to work together to solve common industry problems, and more diverse contributor pools can lead to better solutions. The reasons are not all altruistic, of course. Open source can lower the cost of development and ownership, help with scalability, and even provide some regulatory insulation. It's helped banks speed up integrations with technology vendors and made it easier to share data with clients. There are even ripple effects to engineering retention and job satisfaction, Raphael said, adding that: "Contributing to open source and having your name out there in open source is almost like table stakes." It's hard to talk about Wall Street's adoption of open source without talking about the cloud. Wall Street largely held out on adopting the public cloud, with regulatory uncertainty and security concerns being two big reasons. But that started to change around 2019 and 2020, when the cloud became the place for data and analytics, faster experimentation, and a breeding ground for launching businesses. To reap the benefits of speed and cost efficiency, companies had to adopt a different tool kit and approach compared with developing software on physical servers. That brought many finance firms face-to-face with open-source technologies, like Kubernetes and Docker, which are cornerstones of cloud-native software development. While it's tricky to distill the exact number of commits financial services workers have made on GitHub — company policies and restrictions push developers to use their personal accounts rather than ones tied to their work emails — FINOS's low-ball estimate shows a steady increase. The latest data shows a 26% jump in the number of commits between 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, FINOS last month topped 100 members in a group that includes the four biggest US banks, the hedge fund Point72, American Express, and vendors like public-cloud providers and Nvidia. At the company level, finance firms have also been open-sourcing platforms that were originally developed internally. JPMorgan open-sourced its design platform, Salt, in 2022, Morgan Stanley contributed its Morphir platform that helps business and technology teams collaborate in 2020, and Citi open-sourced GitProxy, a risk and controls tool, the same year. Other examples include Goldman Sachs' key data platform, Legend, and Aladdin, the crown jewel of BlackRock's tech. "Eventually, people, they evolve toward a standard, and competitors realize the benefit of having the standard outweighs being different," Katz said. In many cases, the things being open-sourced are software-development utilities, like methods for writing log files, ways to connect to networks, formulas for linking datasets, or frameworks for testing applications. Katz described them as "trivial commodity capabilities" that aren't core to business or drive value. "You want to test your application? Your IP is the application. How you test it? Much more commodity," he said. At Blackstone, a project is underway to build an open-source library for its portfolio companies in the realm of data management, data engineering, and generative AI, the firm's chief technology officer, John Stecher, told BI. The private equity giant was already spending a considerable amount of its own engineering resources on its own data and AI ambitions. The project, which started about a year ago, aims to give portfolio companies a head start on the engineering legwork while allowing them to pivot engineers to spend time on more meaningful work. Blackstone also benefits since portfolio companies can contribute back to the effort by fixing coding bugs and developing features and functionalities, Stecher said. While there are no direct savings for Blackstone, it should allow portfolio companies to be more effective with fewer engineering resources, he said. The ethos of redeploying engineering talent is one that Stecher prioritizes. "As we go through discussing open source, the more I can pivot engineers away from building functionality that is nonproprietary and duplicative on the Street and just have a smaller set of those engineers build that collaboratively, I can have them focus on delivering much-higher-value work for our clients at the end of the day," he said. Using open source doesn't come without risks, however. One challenge is around licensing, Goldman's Raphael noted. Open-source software is released under specific licenses that have their own set of requirements, like disclosing modifications or not being able to use it for commercial purposes. "We have a full formal governance of what projects are allowed to be in, what vetted licenses are allowed, to make sure that we're not using things inappropriately," Raphael said. Another issue is that because open-source libraries are available to anyone, it's possible for people to try to sneak in bad code that could lead to far-reaching cyberattacks, in what's known as supply-chain attacks. "We take the supply chain of what's actually being used where and which libraries we're using from open source, tracking that also really at a detailed granular level to make sure we know where all the software providence comes from," Raphael said. Now finance firms are even looking to bring the open-source approach to the latest technology frontier on Wall Street: AI. The intersection of generative AI and open source has been on full display ever since the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek rolled out its AI models that are as good as, or even better than, the best products from OpenAI. DeepSeek's offerings have sharply undercut OpenAI on price, shaking up Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The budding rivalry between the two companies has thrown a spotlight on open-source models (like DeepSeek's) versus proprietary approaches (like OpenAI's). Last year, FINOS launched an AI-readiness group that's attracted firms like Citi, Morgan Stanley, and the London Stock Exchange. The effort is designed to create a collaborative environment to develop frameworks and policies around generative AI, related to concerns like mitigating bias in models and adopting new tech. "That's very much an industry problem, not an individual company problem," Katz said. "What better thing than to mutualize it and try to tackle it together." Jump to

Title: Morningstar Discussion about The State of Vanguard in 2025 (Highlights)

My Money Blog As a follow-up to my thoughts on Should I Stay with Vanguard? and their recent expense ratio drop announcement, I recently listened to this 30-minute Morningstar video with Daniel Sotiroff and Susan Dziubinski about the current state of Vanguard in 2025. I think it provided some good additional context. Here are some highlights and brief commentary. Vanguard funds brought in another net $222 billion last year, with the ETFs up $306 billion but the mutual funds losing $84 billion. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF brought in $117 billion all by itself. Vanguard holds over $10 trillion in assets total. Overall, they are not struggling at all. However, with the mutual funds following the industry trends and still losing assets, mutual fund holders should be wary of them being forced to sell positions and create capital gains distributions. This includes foremost their actively-managed mutual funds but possibly eventually their Target Retirement 20XX Funds. Vanguard is rolling out a lot of new bond ETFs. Vanguard Core Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VCRM), a broad US muni-bond ETF. Vanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VSDM), a short-term US muni-bond ETF. Both ETFs launched November 2024. Coming in 2025 are the low-cost index ETFs that hold T-Bills: Vanguard 0-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (VBIL) and the Vanguard Ultra-Short Treasury ETF (VGUS). Then there is Vanguard Short Duration Bond ETF (VSDB), which is actively-managed and will hold short-term bonds across multiple bond sectors. Vanguard is splitting off their Wealth and Advice division entirely. It will now be completely separate from the Personal Investors division, showing how important it is to the current company. Heading this division will be Joanna Rotenberg, most recently employed at the wealth advice division of Fidelity Investments. As an everyday Vanguard customer, I’m constantly seeing their advice ads to meet with an advisor, but I’m still waiting for them to actually make the product useful. With all these new executives, I guess I’ll have to give them at least another year or two to figure it out. Count me as hopeful on this one. The new CEO from BlackRock, Salim Ramji, has also stated a desire to focus on helping retires to create income from their portfolios. The drawdown period is another big problem in the industry, which I don’t think anyone else has solved yet either. In fact, creating a stable paycheck is even harder than just growing your portfolio over time and accepting the volatility. Count me as skeptical on this front. There is an upcoming virtual Joint Special Meeting of Shareholders on February 26, 2025. Sounds like a good example of “Oh, the fund holders own the company and get a say in things!”, but after looking at the fund proxy vote , it looks like the usual nothing-burger. There’s only one real question on the proxy vote card (the second one is “You gonna go to the meeting?”). They’ve already picked the replacement trustees that they want; it’s not like it’s an election where people are running with different platforms. You basically vote for them all, or withhold your vote against them all. Given the huge institutional holders, I don’t even know if every retail investor voted “against all” that it would actually prevent any of their chosen picks from joining the board. Image credit to Canva AI “HMS Vanguard on hopeful seas at sunrise” I agree with your comments on Vanguard. I’m still with Vanguard (25% of portfolio) and plan to stay unless something negative happens. I liked that Vanguard lowered fees but I’m only in the S&P fund which wasn’t affected. Vanguard lost its way when Tim Buckley took over!!! Their customer service is horrible. I am slowly closing accounts and can’t wait to be out of there.

Title: Bitcoin to $500K? Everything needed for Standard Chartered’s bet to become reality!

Bitcoin would need to match its 2024 surge for that $500K bet to become a reality. What are the odds? While Bitcoin [BTC] faces a bearish pullback driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Asset Research sees a brighter future. In fact, he’s in the news today after he set a bold $500k target for the leading crypto asset before the end of Trump’s presidency. AMBCrypto unpacks the key drivers that could make—or break—this bold prediction. 2025 kicked off with bold predictions – Bitcoin strategic reserves, banks offering BTC services, and a $150k price target. Two months in, BTC’s still under $100k. Clearly, the market’s gone the other way, with investors playing it safe and chasing quick profits. In this environment, a $500k prediction from Standard Chartered might sound a bit too ambitious. However, what grabbed AMBCrypto’s attention? This target was made under Trump’s administration – and there’s a reason behind it. Since November’s elections, BTC has surged by over 30%, with $90k as the average market bottom. To hit $500k, Bitcoin would need a 455% jump before 2028. Source: TradingView (BTC/USD) Looking back, BTC registered gains of 156% in 2024. If it pulls off similar growth in the next few years, Standard Chartered’s bold prediction might just hit the mark. Additionally, Trump’s regulatory shake-up, the SEC overhaul, his dislike of high interest rates, the DOGE cabinet, and a new crypto task force are pushing big targets forward – calling the current volatility as just a “temporary dip.” A big chunk of BTC’s 156% YTD jump is thanks to U.S Spot ETFs, which have pumped billions into Bitcoin. BlackRock (IBIT) alone saw its Bitcoin holdings jump by a staggering 726%, now sitting at 585,393 BTC at press time. Source: BitBo And, it doesn’t stop there – BlackRock is set to launch a Bitcoin ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) in Europe, bringing even more global exposure and a flood of new capital into the market. With all these factors at play, Standard Chartered’s bold Bitcoin prediction is starting to look more like a calculated bet on strong fundamentals, not just speculation. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 So, a repeat of the 2024 pump doesn’t seem too far off. But now, it all comes down to whether Trump’s promises are executed swiftly as 2025 plays out. The market is watching closely, especially as the ongoing trade war has already driven many into “extreme” fear.

Will BlackRock replicate the remarkable success of its U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in AUM (assets under management), plans to expand its Bitcoin-related exchange-traded products to Europe. According to a Bloomberg report, the fund is likely to be domiciled in Switzerland, and the marketing efforts for the product could kick off as early as this month, per close sources interviewed by the publisher. Commenting on the update, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst noted that the U.S. and Asia currently dominate the BTC ETF market. The analyst also said that Europe isn’t much into ‘hot’ trends. “Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world…If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, although keep in mind Europeans much less into ‘hot sauce’ than US and certain Asian countries.” Source: X As of this writing, details on the product’s fees were not public yet. That said, BlackRock was among the first issuers to get approval to launch a U.S. spot BTC ETF in early 2024. The product, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), has been most successful both crypto scene and across traditional markets, too. As of the 4th of February, IBIT had amassed over 585.3K BTC, worth nearly $58 billion based on press time market prices. Source: iShares Interestingly, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has also doubled down on BTC. He reiterated that it was the best asset of choice for anyone seeking refuge from fiat debasement (inflation) or political instability. In fact, during the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he stated, “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or… of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears.. BTC could be $500k, $600k, $700k” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

It has the heavy backing of the Trump brand; the president’s son announced its launch back in August, and the president himself has promoted the project. Following the purchase, Donald Trump Jr. was announced as the surprise closing speaker at Thursday's Ondo Summit event. Ondo Finance said that top asset managers will be able to tokenize their assets leading to more transparency, less fraud, and the opportunity for clients to earn yield. It added that Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, WisdomTree, and Google Cloud served as “design advisors” for the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain. We’re delighted to announce our surprise closing speaker at the Ondo Summit: Donald Trump Jr.(@DonaldJTrumpJr)! 🇺🇸 The future of RWAs in the US is bright, and new leadership has the potential to make the US the global center for crypto.

The Ethereum-based ONDO is now the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $4.3 billion, CoinGecko shows. Institutions in the traditional finance world have been banging the RWA drum for some time now. BlackRock boss Larry Fink praised Ethereum for how it would lead to the tokenization of financial markets, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson has said that the technology of securities will change thanks to the blockchain. “[Blockchain] technology is going to open up a lot of really interesting types of investment opportunities,” Johnson said last year.

Truth.fi, the new financial arm of Trump Media and Technology Group—of which the president is the majority shareholder—said Thursday that it had applied to register trademarks for brand names for six new investment vehicles. Of the six vehicles, two will be Bitcoin funds: the Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF and the Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus SMA. ETFs are funds that let speculators buy shares tracking the price of commodities or securities. Top fund managers—including BlackRock and Fidelity—last year launched spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, giving more traditional investors the chance to buy exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency. An SMA, or separately managed account, is a type of investment product that allows clients—particularly high net-worth individuals—to have greater say over what the investment vehicle contains. “We aim to give investors a means to invest in American energy, manufacturing, and other firms that provide a competitive alternative to the woke funds and debanking problems that you find throughout the market," said Trump Media CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes. It's not currently clear what the "Plus" part of the Bitcoin Plus products would entail. Decrypt reached out to Trump Media for comment about what the Bitcoin Plus products will entail, but did not receive an immediate response. TMTG—which owns the Truth Social network that Trump posts on daily—last week announced the launch of Truth.Fi. The fintech-focused brand said it would be crypto-involved, with $250 million cash that would be custodied by Charles Schwab. The announcement said that the brand “may buy Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities” as a way to diversify its portfolio. Bitcoin ETFs have been wildly successful in the U.S. since launching in January 2024, breaking records and bringing in billions of dollars worth of trading volume. The price of Bitcoin has in part shot up as a result, repeatedly pushing to new all-time high marks over the last year. President Trump cast himself as a Bitcoin-friendly candidate ahead of his November 5 win. The new commander in chief has promised to help the digital asset industry and has appointed crypto-enthusiastic members to his cabinet.

Title: Tracking the EV battery factory construction boom across North America | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The onshoring of battery manufacturing for EVs started as a trickle during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then it turned into a tsunami. In 2019, just two battery factories were operating in the United States with another two under construction. Today there are about 34 battery factories either planned, under construction, or operational in the country. Former U.S. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law August 16, 2022, might not have been the initial catalyst behind the onshoring battery factory trend. But it did help open the spigot and accelerate the pace of factory projects — not to mention sparking a climate tech arms race with the EU. Two and a half years later, we’re still tracking the fallout, even though the IRA’s fate is now uncertain. In January 2025, President Donald Trump ordered a freeze on IRA funding disbursements, but many of those funds have already made it into manufacturers’ hands. That order also hasn’t stopped the already-moving train of billions of private sector dollars invested in clean energy. Because whether Trump wants to back clean energy or not, the fact remains that the U.S. needs to have more control over its battery supply chain, rather than ceding control to China. That’s particularly true in light of Trump’s 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Automakers saw what happened during the chip shortage crisis that hampered manufacturing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they are loathe to repeat the same mistakes. What has followed is a wave of automakers and battery makers — foreign and domestic — pledging to produce North American–made batteries before 2030. (See each automaker’s plans here and battery maker’s plans here.) Why so much investment into onshoring EV battery production? One reason was because the IRA is rife with incentives for automakers and consumers to produce domestically — a concerted effort to end the U.S.’s reliance on China for batteries, while simultaneously meeting Biden’s goal to make 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. electric or hybrid by 2030. And though Trump has taken a step back from the IRA, electric vehicles can still qualify for the full $7,500 EV tax credit if they meet certain battery sourcing and production guidelines. The IRA requires that 60% of the value of battery components be produced or assembled in North America in 2024 to qualify for half of the tax credit, $3,750. That percentage will increase to 100% starting in 2029. To get the remaining half, 50% of the value of critical materials must be sourced from the U.S. or a free trade agreement country in 2024. That percentage increases to 60%, 70% and 80% for vehicles produced in 2025, 2026 and 2027 and beyond, respectively. The IRA’s advanced manufacturing credits that give the producer a payout from the Treasury are likely at risk of being eliminated, but it’s worth explaining how they went for the past couple of years. Under Section 45X, the production of battery cells qualifies for a credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour of capacity, and the production of battery modules qualifies for $10 per kilowatt-hour. (Battery cells are containers that chemically store energy, and they are arranged into modules. Battery packs can be made up of cells or modules.) Companies can also be reimbursed 10% of the costs incurred due to the production of electrode active materials, like the cathode and anode. The cathode stores lithium when a battery is discharged, and the anode stores lithium when a battery is charging. They are both components of a cell and can contain materials like graphite, silicon, zinc, aluminum, magnesium, nickel and cobalt. Automakers and battery manufacturers have collectively invested and promised to invest around $112 billion in building domestic cell and module manufacturing. Together, these companies promise to deliver an annual capacity of close to 1,200 gigawatt-hours before 2030, if each factory reaches maximum capacity. That’s roughly enough batteries for 18 million EVs, based on previous Tesla predictions that say about 100 GWh capacity can power around 1.5 million EVs. Outside of the battery sector, the IRA has helped fuel a total $245 billion in private investment into clean energy and technology manufacturing, according to Atlas Public Policy’s Clean Economy Tracker. The investment into producing batteries in the U.S. and Canada changes regularly, so we’ve started tracking these promises. TechCrunch created a handy map showing the location of each battery factory plus some basic information, including planned capacity. For those looking for more details and context, scroll down to read about each manufacturer’s planned or operational battery factories. Or click on a location on the map for a pop-up to appear. Note: The factories included below are producing or will produce battery cells and modules. We did not include things like battery materials production. Therefore, it is not an exhaustive list of all the production going into creating EV batteries in North America. Where are the EV batteries being produced in North America? This article was originally published August 16, 2023, and was last updated February 6, 2025. In October 2022, BMW announced a $1.7 billion investment in the U.S. that would see its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant readied for the production of EVs. Of the total funding, $700 million was allocated to the buildout of a battery assembly facility in nearby Woodruff. The automaker told TechCrunch that the start of production is scheduled for the end of 2026, but it hasn’t confirmed which EVs will be produced there. BMW’s Spartanburg factory is currently where its sports utility and crossovers are built, including the X3, X4, X5, X6, X7 and XM. BMW also partnered up with battery maker AESC (formerly Envision AESC) to invest additional funds in a battery cell plant in Florence, South Carolina (more on that in the AESC section). The AESC plant will produce BMW’s new sixth-generation round lithium-ion battery cells for Plant Spartanburg EVs. Groundbreaking on both the Woodruff and Florence facilities occurred in June. In September 2023, Daimler Truck and Paccar announced a joint venture with energy technology company Accelera and Chinese battery maker EVE Energy to build a battery cell production plant that would support the adoption of EVs for medium- and heavy-duty commercial transportation. The companies said in January 2024 that they selected a site in Mississippi. Accelera, Daimler and Paccar will each own 30% of the combined company, called Amplify Cell Technologies, and jointly control the business, which will focus on lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery tech. EVE will serve as a technology provider, contributing its battery cell design and manufacturing expertise in exchange for 10% of ownership. In September 2021, Ford created a joint venture (JV) with South Korean battery maker SK On. The goal of the JV, called BlueOval SK, is to build three battery plants in the United States. Two are located in Kentucky; the third factory in Tennessee will be co-located with a Ford assembly plant, which will produce the automaker’s second-generation electric truck, code named Project T3. Ford and SK On secured a $9.2 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help finance the construction of the three battery factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. While one of the Kentucky plants is scheduled to begin production in 2025, the second plant’s production has been paused as Ford keeps an eye on consumer demand for EVs. Ford is also building a lithium-iron-phosphate plant in Michigan. Chinese battery maker CATL is licensing its technology to Ford as a service provider on a contractual basis. That might change in the future, though, as Ford has now attracted the ire of House Republicans who are probing the automaker’s relationship with the Chinese battery company. In November 2023, Ford made the decision to scale back investment in its Michigan plant from $3.5 billion down to $2 billion amid slower-than-expected demand for EVs, which means a 43% drop in production capacity and reduced expected employment. General Motors aims to have three total battery plants in the U.S. through its joint venture with LG Energy Solutions, which was named Ultium Cells until October 2024. That joint venture secured in December 2022 a $2.5 billion loan from the government to help fund its battery factory projects. Not only has GM dropped the brand name Ultium, but it also plans to adopt lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology to reduce the cost of its EVs by “up to $6,000,” GM’s VP of batteries Kurt Kelty said at the automaker’s investor day. The Ultium platform uses the more common nickel manganese cobalt recipe. GM also said during its October 2024 investor day that it would build a new battery cell development center in Warren, Michigan, with start of production targeted for early 2027. LG isn’t the only battery maker GM is working with. The automaker in April 2023 announced a joint venture with Samsung SDI to build a new battery plant in the United States. Aside from volume production, GM has also partnered with startup SolidEnergy Systems in 2021 to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts. The goal is to build a high-capacity, pre-production lithium-ion battery. GM is working on taking control of the battery materials supply chain as well. In March 2022, the company partnered with South Korea’s Posco Chemical to build a $400 million battery materials facility in Canada. The plant will produce cathode active materials. GM announced in February 2024 a deal with LG Chem that would see the automaker investing $19 billion over the next decade to source critical materials from LG Chem’s Tennessee plant. In August 2022, Honda announced its joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solutions to supply the North American market with “pouch type” battery cells. The facility in Ohio will produce both cells and modules. The automaker has also made strides to secure battery resource recycling channels and has agreements with businesses, including Ascend Elements, Cirba Solutions and Posco Holdings. Honda’s engine plant in Anna, Ohio, is also in the process of being retooled to add production of casing for battery modules that will power Honda and Acura EVs made in Ohio. In April 2023, Hyundai and SK On approved plans to set up a joint venture to build a $5 billion battery plant in Bartow County, Georgia. Within a few months, Hyundai and LG Energy Solution formed another JV to build a battery cell factory near Savannah, Georgia, that will support the production of 300,000 units of EVs annually once the plant reaches mass production. The automaker said Hyundai Mobis, Hyundai’s parts and service arm, will assemble battery packs using cells from the plant. Hyundai Mobis in 2022 also announced plans to build an EV battery module plant in Alabama that will be able to supply more than 200,000 EV batteries annually to its parent company once the plant reaches full capacity. Mercedes-Benz opened a battery plant at its existing manufacturing facility in Alabama in 2022. That summer, the plant also became the production site for the automaker’s fully electric EQS SUV. The Alabama facility is also assembling the EQE SUV and the Maybach EQS SUV, according to a spokesperson from the company. Mercedes is also working with Sila, a next-gen battery materials company, to incorporate Sila’s battery chemistry into batteries as an option for buyers of the upcoming G-Class. Sila replaces the graphite in a battery cell with silicon and is in the process of scaling up at its new Washington state facility. The companies are targeting mid-decade for a range-extended version of the G-class. Stellantis and Samsung SDI commenced construction on their joint-venture EV battery facility in Indiana in March 2023. The factory will produce both lithium-ion cells and modules. The company announced in July 2023 it would build a second battery factory with Samsung, which will open in early 2027. In October, Stellantis shared more details. Stellantis, which includes brands Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, also announced a joint venture with LG Energy Solution in 2021, called NextStar Energy, to build a North American factory with an annual capacity of 40 GWh. In March 2022, the two companies announced a binding agreement to invest (CAD $5 billion) $3.7 billion to produce cells and modules at a manufacturing plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Since beginning production at Gigafactory Nevada in 2017, Tesla has produced more than 7.3 billion battery cells and 1.5 million battery packs, which provide about 39 GWh capacity annually, according to Panasonic. Tesla in January 2023 announced plans to invest billions more into the Nevada factory to include a new 4680 cell factory with capacity to produce enough batteries for 1.5 million light-duty vehicles annually. The 4680 cells, which were designed by Tesla and revealed at Battery Day 2020, are meant to reduce battery cost by over 50%. Tesla has been trying to get the cells to volume production over the last few years but has run into roadblocks. A recent report from The Information shows that Elon Musk may have to rely on outside suppliers for batteries soon if the 4680 team doesn’t make headway. At the start of 2023, Tesla also laid out plans to expand its existing Gigafactory Austin to include battery cell testing and the manufacture of cathode and drive units, but hasn’t shared more details on those plans. In May 2023, Tesla broke ground on a Texas lithium refinery, making it one of the only U.S. automakers to refine its own lithium. The automaker said it would spend $375 million on the Corpus Christi factory that will have a capacity of 50 GWh. Tesla included an update in its Q4 2024 earnings report on the refinery, saying that it plans to bring the plant online in 2025 before scaling production. Toyota’s planned battery plant in North Carolina, initially announced in 2021, will produce both cells and modules, according to the company. In late October 2023, Toyota announced that it would invest billions more into the factory. When it comes online, it’ll have 10 production lines to support both hybrid and EVs. In February 2025, Toyota announced that its North Carolina plant is ready to begin production and will start shipping batteries for North American electrified vehicles in April. Toyota has also enlisted the help of South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution, which will exclusively build EV batteries for the Japanese automaker out of its Michigan plant (more on that below.) The Japanese automaker is also building a battery lab at its North American research and development headquarters in Michigan, where it can develop and evaluate the quality of its EV batteries. The $48 million lab is expected to begin operations in 2025, and it will support the company’s manufacturing at factories in North Carolina and Kentucky. In July 2022, Volkswagen set up a separate battery company, PowerCo SE, to build batteries for its upcoming EVs. Since its launch, the company has decided on the location of three cell factories: Two in Europe (Salzgitter, Germany, and Valencia, Spain) and one in North America (St. Thomas, Canada). PowerCo expects to generate an annual revenue of over 20 billion euros by 2030. While VW’s battery factory is in Canada and not technically in the U.S., it should still be eligible to receive Inflation Reduction Act incentives. Volvo has a battery assembly factory in Charleston, South Carolina, but the automaker does not manufacture batteries or battery components there. Volvo would not confirm any other plans it has for battery production in North America. AESC (formerly Envision AESC) is a Japanese battery technology company that has promised to build three U.S. facilities before the end of the decade. The company’s Tennessee plant has been in operation for some time. AESC broke ground at its Kentucky and South Carolina plants in August 2022 and June 2023, respectively. In March 2024, AESC said it would expand its South Carolina operations, bringing total investment in the project up to $3.12 billion. But in February 2025, AESC paused those expansion plans after the state pulled $100 million in bonds to support the project. The company said its existing plant will have enough capacity to serve BMW. Gotion Inc., which is headquartered in Silicon Valley and owned by Chinese company Gotion High-Tech, first announced its intent to build a battery factory in Michigan in October 2022. The factory, which secured $175 million in state funds in April 2023, aimed to build both cathode and anodes that could be used for both EVs and solar generators, according to a spokesperson from the company. However, Gotion has faced pushback from locals. The township’s board voted to reverse a previously approved plan to extend the city’s water supply to the location of the factory. In March, Gotion filed a lawsuit against the town, which is ongoing. While the Michigan factory is clearly on hold, Gotion has another one in the works. In September 2023, Gotion also announced plans to set up a second battery manufacturing plant in Illinois. The company is on the receiving end of state incentives valued at $536 million and expects to receive tax benefits totaling $213 million over 30 years, as long as Gotion invests a minimum of $1.9 billion and the creation of thousands of well-paid jobs. Battery cell and module developer Kore Power announced in March that it had received approval to build a battery manufacturing factory in Buckeye, Arizona. Kore Power will produce batteries for energy storage systems and e-mobility products, including cars, trucks, buses, boats and trains. The company told TechCrunch it intends to support OEMs by manufacturing 30D-compliant batteries, so Kore is working closely with domestic partners to line up critical materials suppliers onshore. South Korea’s LG Energy Solution supplies EV batteries to automakers like Tesla, Lucid Motors, Toyota and Proterra. The battery maker has joint ventures to build battery factories with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai and Stellantis. In early 2023, LG said it would quintuple the capacity of its existing lithium-ion cell plant in Michigan, which was built in 2010, as part of a deal with Toyota LG’s Holland factory makes large polymer battery cells, or pouch type cells, and packs for EVs. The expanded plant will produce new long cell design batteries, which LG says should add more range, better storage, and a more simplified pack structure. The battery maker also said it would quadruple its planned investment in a new factory in Arizona to $5.5 billion, a large portion of which will be dedicated to EV battery production. The complex will have two manufacturing facilities — one dedicated to cylindrical batteries for EVs and another for lithium iron phosphate pouch-type batteries for energy storage systems. In August 2023, LG announced a building spree in North America, with plans to spend up to $17 billion through 2025 on constructing a total of eight factories (two of which are already operational) with more than 300 GWh capacity. LG has not yet shared details on each plant. LG’s parent company, LG Chem, separately broke ground on a Tennessee plant that will produce cathode material in December 2023. LG plans to invest $3.2 billion in that plant with the goal of producing 60,000 tons of cathode material at peak production. GM has signed on as a customer, pledging $19 billion. Northvolt, a Swedish producer of lithium-ion batteries, announced in late September 2023 plans to open its first gigafactory in North America. The company had reportedly been evaluating between North America or Germany for its next gigafactory, and the former won out due to the incentives in the IRA. The project is expected to cost just over $7 billion, with Northvolt bringing in $3.2 billion and local and federal governments contributing around $4.2 billion. The expansion is off the back of a $1.2 billion raise, backed by BlackRock. Northvolt told TechCrunch it has an “offtake agreement with an anchor customer,” meaning a buyer for its cells, but wouldn’t disclose the name of the company. The factory will also feature Revolt, Northvolt’s battery recycling program, which will have a capacity of 15 GWh. Northvolt told TechCrunch it hopes to recycle half of the raw materials needed for cell production by 2030. Battery startup Our Next Energy (ONE) announced plans in October 2022 to build a gigafactory in Michigan devoted to lithium-iron-phosphate cells, AKA LFP batteries. The facility, which is supported by a $200 million grant from the state of Michigan, will include raw material refinement, cathode materials production, and cell and battery manufacturing. To that end, the company in February 2023 raised a $300 million Series B to help get it to production. Panasonic said in July 2022 that it plans to build the world’s largest EV battery plant, a $4 billion factory in Kansas that will manufacture and supply lithium-ion batteries to EV makers. The facility in De Soto will be Panasonic’s second EV battery plant in the U.S., after the Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA) facility in Sparks, Nevada, which operates inside Tesla’s Nevada Gigafactory and supplies the EV maker with batteries. Panasonic said in June 2023 that it plans to expand production at PENA by 10% within three years. Around the same time, the Japanese company said it would build at least two new factories for the production of Tesla 4680 battery cells in North America by 2030. However, in January, Panasonic’s CEO Yuki Kusumi said the battery business will focus on boosting productivity over building another battery factory. South Korean battery manufacturer SK On has created joint ventures to develop batteries with Ford and Hyundai. The company’s U.S. subsidiary, SK Battery America, has its own plans. SK Battery America has invested $2.6 billion into two manufacturing plants in Jackson County, Georgia, and reached mass production in early 2022.

Title: Ireland under-20s make three changes to starting team for Scotland clash

Ireland under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and two positional switches to the starting team from that which lost 19-3 against England for Saturday night’s game against Scotland at the Hive stadium in Edinburgh (7.45pm, live on RTÉ2). There are a couple of alterations enforced by injuries to rightwing Derry Moloney, who broke a finger but could be back in time for the Wales match, and loosehead prop Alex Usanov; he suffered a leg injury that will see him miss the remainder of the tournament. Secondrow prospect Alan Spicer, who was sorely missed in Cork, has a small stress fracture in his foot but it doesn’t require surgery. His progress will be monitored. Daniel Green, an outhalf by inclination, comes in at fullback with Charlie Molony switching to the rightwing in place of Derry Moloney. Gene O’Leary Kareem swaps a place on the bench for the 13 jersey and will partner Ireland’s outstanding player the last day, Connor Fahy, who moves in one place to inside centre, in the midfield. Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth drops to the replacements. Former Newbridge pupil Billy Bohan, who replaced Usanov after 14 minutes at Musgrave Park, is named in the run-on side with Blackrock College prop Paddy Moore, a son of former Blackrock, Clontarf and a former schools international Dave, promoted to the replacements. There is one other change to the bench with Sale Sharks scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of Alex, fit again following injury. Ireland are looking to atone for a largely poor performance against England that was riddled with mistakes and indiscipline, albeit against a big, physical England side. They take on a Scotland side that lost 22-10 to Italy in the opening round of fixtures at Saturday’s venue. Irish under-20s back coach Ian Keatley explained that while they wanted the defeat to “hurt” a little, it is important that the group don’t become inhibited by the setback. It is a case of learn, move on, and be better. “Obviously, frustration [was the overwhelming feeling in the immediate aftermath of the game] because we felt that the squad of boys were capable of much more. And we know we came up against [an] English team [that] everyone thought that we didn’t stand a chance [of beating]. “But I think the frustrating part was that we created chances. I think we got inside their 22 nine or 10 times, and we didn’t come away with any tries. While they got into our 22 five times and came away with one try. “When you look back, look at the stats and how the game went, we had 17 penalties against us as opposed to their 10. There were a lot of unforced errors, just little mistakes; it’s frustrating that we just didn’t take any of our chances. “In reviewing the game, you have to be very balanced. You do want them to hurt a little bit and that it is okay [to feel that way] but then bounce back in training this week.” Ireland Under-20: D Green (QUB); C Molony (UCD), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC), C Fahy (Clontarf), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley), B Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: C Magee (Banbridge), P Moore (Blackrock College), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), D Walsh (Terenure College), O Minogue (Shannon), W Wootton (Sale Sharks), D Hicks (Garryowen), E Smyth (Cork Constitution).

Title: Prepared For Financial TEOTWAWKI? – Part 3, by St. Funogas
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/02/08/prepared-for-financial-teotwawki-part-3-by-st-funogas/

(Continued from Part 2.) The current war in Ukraine is a prime example of how the system works for large corporations without providing a single benefit for We the People. After the Soviet Union collapsed in late 1991, Russia asked to join NATO. Even though having Russia as a NATO partner would have been the best possible arrangement for the citizens of the US, European Union, and Russia, the US, needing enemies in order to keep justifying obscene defense budgets, dictated “no”. In 2014, the US orchestrated the overthrow of Ukraine’s freely-elected government to install an anti-Russian president, then contrary to all the agreements and treaties we signed with Russia, invited Ukraine to join NATO so the US could put missiles right on Russia’s border, 275 miles from Moscow. After successfully inciting Russia to attack Ukraine, the military industrial complex (MIC) got richer selling arms to Uncle Sam who gave them to Ukraine. Congress added the cost to the national debt. US lackey Boris Johnson went to Kiev two months into the war to talk Zelensky, who knew Ukraine didn’t have a prayer of winning against Russia, out of negotiating a truce. The MIC made three more years of obscene profits, all paid for by Congress’s deficit spending. At some point, the war will end, as Trump has promised. But We the People will have gained nothing but more debt. Ukraine will have gained nothing, lost much of their infrastructure, and the majority of the 1,000,000+ dead and wounded were Ukrainian. The political leadership doesn’t care about the human losses on either side, the US-led NATO-stan proclaimed they were willing to fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian. At war’s end, BlackRock, (another large US corporation who owns Congress) will go in and make obscene profits cleaning up the mess and rebuilding infrastructure. Congress will “loan” this money to Ukraine but it actually goes straight into BlackRock’s coffers before the cleanup begins. All this money will be added to Uncle Sam’s national debt. The US knows Ukraine can never repay the debt so using what’s known as “debt-trap diplomacy,” one condition of the loan is that Ukraine pledges to give up control of their resources so big American corporations can go in and extract the oil, minerals, and other resources to enrich themselves. These huge corporations in the MIC, BlackRock, Big Oil and mining companies, write large campaign-donation checks to Congressmen, give them insider info on stock trades, and promise them high-paying jobs as “consultants” after they retire from Congress. None of this benefits We the People but we’ve been propagandized to believe it does somehow so we keep sending fiscally irresponsible congressmen to Washington to save us from the boogeymen they’ve created. When they pass the next budget with 33% of the expenses put on Uncle Sam’s card, we gripe like hell wondering how they can be so fiscally irresponsible, but then in the next election, send them back to Washington to screw us all over again. With Greenland: “wash, rinse, repeat.” Under the usual guise of “national security,” pay BlackRock big bucks to go in and build up infrastructure and add several new military bases. Pay the MIC to supply the bases with weapons and military hardware. Congress adds all of this, in addition to the cost of buying Greenland in the first place, to the national debt. Once the infrastructure is in place, let large corporations who bought off Congress go in and extract all the oil, minerals, and rare earths. Nobody is asking what benefit We the People are gaining from it all other than more debt and closer to the financial waterfall. But hey, how cool is it that we bought Greenland?! The MIC made 20 years of profits from the Afghanistan war. The mightiest military in the history of the universe was unable to conquer an Afghan army made up of a bunch of boys with BB guns riding ponies. Why did we still lose the war after 20 years? Because Congress didn’t want to win the war, their MIC buddies needed the money and Congressmen Smith, Jones, and Rutherford wanted the “consulting” jobs after they left congress. We left millions of dollars of military equipment behind so the MIC could make a zillion more dollars selling new stuff to the US Department of Defense to replace it all. Nobody asked why we and our children and grandchildren gained from the $2 trillion we spent there. When we were runt of Afghanistan, that $2 trillion amounted to 7.4% of our national debt at the time! That 7.4% should be a “holy cr*p!” number but everyone ignores it in the nebulous name of “national security.” We. the taxpayers. almost never ask ourselves how any of the money, and not just defense spending, spent by Congress benefits us. That should be our most important question but we fail to even wonder, let alone ask the question. Again, we don’t have fiscally irresponsible congressmen, only fiscally irresponsible voters. It should be plainly clear why the defense budget is almost a trillion dollars. It should be plain that there’s no way to justify 800+ military bases. It should be plain that the world would be a better place and the US would be more secure if Russia were our friend like they want to be, instead of making them our enemy. Aside from these obvious reasons, there’s still no reason to deficit spend $1 trillion dollars every year in the name of national security. But propaganda is a powerful thing. Even though the defense budget takes up almost half of the money Uncle Sam puts on his credit card each year, all of which is added to the national debt, how likely is it that any meaningful defense budget reductions will happen in order to reduce deficit spending? Based on how many people are offended by this talk of the real purpose of our military, I’m more likely to win the lottery without even buying a ticket than we are to see any defense budget allocations reduced, let alone cut in half which would be a good starting point. It’s safe to say the almost trillion dollars spent on defense won’t be seeing any cuts. That brings our total to Uncle Sam spending 118% of his 2025 income. The other half of the money Uncle Sam puts on his credit card every year brings the total budget up to spending 133% of Uncle Sam’s 2025 income. Most of this other discretionary spending finances government agencies that didn’t exist in times past, and if they did, it was at a much smaller level. Some of these should be eliminated, others at least reduced. This includes, among others, the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, International Affairs, Agriculture, Labor, Science, and NASA. Elon Musk has clearly shown that capitalism can provide all the technology and know-how to make a useful space program work without the need of a government agency. In his inaugural speech, Trump said his next mission was to plant the American flag on Martian soil, something that won’t benefit any of us taxpayers. Nobody is worried about how it will contribute to deficit spending and the national debt. Nobody seems to be care that the American flag will probably be planted in the mud at the bottom of the fiscal Niagara Falls before it’s planted in Martian soil. Don’t expect any cuts in NASA’s $25 billion budget. If Reagan and Papa Bush couldn’t get rid of the Department of Education, DOGE won’t be able to get that through Congress, either. The lobbyists of all these unnecessary wasteful departments will use their powers, as usual, to keep Congress from doing what’s necessary. While we need Trump’s Golden Age of Common Sense as much as anything our country has ever needed since 1776, Congress won’t be helping him to create that age. The US is the only civilized country still making pennies. The planchets are made by a single company who makes large donations to politicians on both sides of the aisle. What are the chances of getting Congress to pass even a small percentage of DOGE’s recommendations when they haven’t even been able to do something as sensible as getting rid of that miserable little coin we all loathe? Cash registers can already round to the nearest nickel if needed so eliminating pennies would be fairly easy. The history of tariffs tells us they do more harm than good. The companies paying the tariffs will have no option but to pass the cost of the tariffs on to consumers. Uncle Sam pockets the difference between the old price and the new price and Americans pay this hidden tax in the form of inflation. The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates, based on 2024 imports, that Trump’s proposed tariffs (including a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports) would generate a gross income of $3.7 trillion over ten years, or $370 billion per year. The net income would be $280 billion per year due to other reductions in revenue the tariffs could cause. The TPC further estimates these tariffs would result in an average lowering of spendable income for each worker by $1,800 dollars per year. Let me put this in very personal terms so you can better understand: since the entire defense budget is paid for with deficit spending, your $1,800 per year would go directly to the defense department so you can personally finance the US foreign policy which the defense department carries out. Would you rather send your $1,800 to the military industrial complex who bought off Congress long ago, or would you perhaps prefer to keep your money to spend on things that are more important to you? The $280 billion generated would only lower Congress’s deficit spending from this year’s $1.78 trillion dollars to $1.5 trillion dollars. (To be concluded tomorrow, in Part 4.)

Title: Ethereum’s Price Still In The Major Uptrend – Analyst Forecast Potential For Further Gains
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-major-uptrend/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T16:00:12Z
Full Content:
With the general crypto market still facing heightened volatility, Ethereum has once again failed to reclaim the pivotal $3,000 price level. Bearish pressure continues to linger in its price action, leading to speculations about its potential in the short term. Although ETH has failed to experience a major surge, analysts believe the altcoin could see a turnaround towards the upside shortly. Ethereum may have seen a notable decline in the last few days, but Ether Naysonal, a market expert and trader is unshaken about the heightened volatility. According to the technical expert, “ETH is still in its major uptrend,” indicating resilience amid broader market volatility. Despite occasional pullbacks, the expert cites that ETH continues to hold key support levels, reinforcing optimistic sentiment among investors. With the altcoin maintaining its uptrend, it could pave the way for a potential breakout toward higher levels in the upcoming weeks. Ether Naysonal highlighted alongside maintaining its major uptrend, ETH has also consistently held the $2,615 support level, which is good for its price action. However, for Ethereum to make a quick recovery, it must at least close above the $2,820 mark for one day. A close above the $2,820 level would likely reignite bullish momentum for the altcoin again. Meanwhile. the much-anticipated pump will be triggered if the candle closes above $2,923. Ethereum has experienced remarkable adoption and interest in spite of occasional price corrections. This growing institutional interest coupled with rising on-activity might serve as key factors bolstering the expected upside move. Ether Naysonal has questioned the actions of individuals presently offloading their ETH holdings despite institutional investors accumulating ETH at a huge scale. Major companies are currently seen acquiring ETH in current market conditions. Financial behemoth and asset manager firm Blackrock has purchased over 100,535 ETH, valued at $284 million. Furthermore, asset management company Fidelity has also acquired about 9,552 ETH, worth around $26.39 million. While the biggest global investment institutions are still purchasing, the analyst asserts it is completely illogical for individual investors to sell after being exposed to misleading waves within a short period. Several bullish structures have emerged on ETH’s chart, suggesting a possible rebound in the short term. With upside momentum building for ETH, the asset may be set for a rally toward a new all-time high. After examining Ethereum’s price action, market expert Jonathan Carter highlighted that the asset is still trading within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern in the weekly time frame. Carter noted that liquidity was collected below support by recent downward wicks before returning to the pattern. Once ETH breaks out of the ascending triangle, Carter anticipates a push towards higher targets such as $3,100, $4,000, $4,850, $6,000, and $7,500 in the long term.

Title: Prime Minister’s global investment summit crucial to Luxon’s year of growth - Matthew Hooton

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and new Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis need to get their ducks lined up ahead of a global investment summit in five weeks. Photo / Alex Burton THREE KEY FACTS The Prime Minister’s global investment summit is just five weeks away. It is the single most important personal initiative Christopher Luxon will take in his year of economic growth. His reputation – and, more importantly, New Zealand’s credibility as a place to invest money – depends on its success. Large, meaningful investments being contracted at the summit or in the weeks following would signal an endorsement of New Zealand’s economic outlook by the world’s smartest financiers, generating a snowball effect. Their absence would do the opposite, communicating to the world’s investment community that they had taken a good look at New Zealand and found its future wanting. Senior officials, business leaders and ministers have warned Luxon that his summit cannot just be a place for cynical “announceables” or, worse, Jacinda Ardern’s infamous “announcements of announcements”. It must deliver actual investments, which is why Luxon ordered work last year on prospectuses outlining immediately investable propositions. A close prime ministerial eye, drawing on his own business experience, is needed to ensure they are credible. The PM chose the dates for the conference, March 13 and 14, to suit key American investors. It speaks to Luxon’s enormous self-confidence in his persuasive abilities that he has bet Muslim investors he has met in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates will travel to New Zealand almost exactly in the middle of Ramadan. A first measure of the summit’s success will be attracting interest from the world’s largest sovereign wealth and asset-management funds. New Zealand has had a good relationship with the biggest, BlackRock, with its $18.4 trillion under management. After Ardern met BlackRock’s Larry Fink in New York in 2022, her successor Chris Hipkins could announce a $2 billion BlackRock investment in renewable energy shortly before the election, although it isn’t clear what, if anything, it will deliver. Luxon also needs other major private-sector funds like Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Deutsche Bank to attend, each managing over $2t of assets. Among sovereign wealth funds, New Zealand has tried unsuccessfully to attract the interest of Norway’s Government Pension Fund, originally established with revenues from its oil industry and now managing over $3t of assets. Luxon’s recent visit to the Middle East has hopefully ensured other trillion-dollar-plus oil-based funds from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will show up. Closer to home, Singapore’s Temasek and Australia’s Future Fund will surely be in the room, along with China’s major $2t-plus funds. Given Luxon’s links as a former chief executive and president of Unilever Canada, that country’s federal pension fund and famous Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and CDPQ funds will be high on his list. It’s also important that smaller funds and individuals with existing personal or commercial relationships with New Zealand are included. Most New Zealand investments are much too small for the big funds to have the management resources to bother with. But, famously, the likes of the late Julian Robertson poured hundreds of millions into New Zealand, obviously seeking a decent return but also out of love for the country. In his will, Robertson donated around a quarter-billion dollars of masterpieces to Auckland Art Gallery. Individuals like Robertson can do what they like with their wealth, answering only to their families. Those investing funds on behalf of others have a duty not to be influenced by sentiment. Their assessments of the business environment, the long-term economic outlook and – most of all – the expected rate of return are paramount. Even conservative funds expect around a 7% return to be interested, and others much more. Our own Superannuation Fund, one of the best performing sovereign wealth funds in recent years, would want 10%. Given its purpose, it would be immoral for even it to invest in New Zealand projects if it expected to lose money compared with what it could earn elsewhere. The same is true for everyone else managing other people’s money who Luxon invites to his summit. Rah-rah speeches, corporate videos or other generic marketing material must be and are ignored. The Government’s overseas investment reforms need to be agreed upon among the coalition partners and passed by Parliament in the next five weeks or the summit is probably best cancelled. Likewise, Finance Minister Nicola Willis has finally been given the prime-ministerial nod to talk about company-tax cuts, but the Budget on May 22 is far too late for any cuts to be confirmed, along with necessary compensating tax increases to avoid worsening the fiscal deficit. Willis must deliver on her promise to be bold. Little tax tweaks will make no difference. At 28%, our company rate is well above all the countries on which Luxon says his year of growth is modelled. Ireland’s is 12.5% and Singapore’s 17%. Even the likes of social-democratic Sweden and Denmark tax companies at only 21% and 22% respectively. If Luxon and Willis believe lowering the company tax rate is necessary to attract investment – and even some right-leaning economists dispute that – cutting it by two or three percentage points would achieve nothing. Similarly, as The Economist highlighted to its global readers on its cover this week, the world is going through a period of rapid and radical deregulation, including in Washington, Buenos Aires, Delhi, London and even Brussels. Every day New Zealand procrastinates we fall even further behind. Ideally, Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop will present his bill to fully reform the Resource Management Act before the summit. At the least, he could rush through legislation so that any projects funded at the summit will receive the same fast-track treatment as the 149 identified in his stop-gap legislation last year. More importantly, Regulation Minister David Seymour needs a rev-up from his boss. His Ministry for Regulation already smells like just another Wellington talk shop. So far, it is reviewing just three sectors, the early childhood education market, agricultural and horticultural products like fertilisers and pesticides, and hairdressing. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Act has argued New Zealand is over-regulated. It surely has a list of regulations to deliver to Luxon that could be repealed in the five weeks before the summit. If not, what hope is there that Seymour’s Wellington bureaucrats will find any thereafter? The Prime Minister raised expectations with his State of the Nation speech a fortnight ago. He has managed Waitangi Day well, by staying away from this year’s circus up north and giving an inspiring speech at Ngāi Tahu’s historic Ōnuku Marae. If he can’t or won’t deliver substance behind both before the summit, his year of economic growth risks going the way of Ardern’s 2019 year of delivery.

Title: ‘We’ve lost 11 days of school ... attendance has collapsed‘: Principals on the enduring effects of Storm Éowyn

Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:47:32Z
Full Content:
Noel Loftus, principal of St Attracta’s National School in Ballaghdereen, Co Roscommon, is still counting the cost of a week without electricity in the aftermath of Storm Éowyn. It was the third enforced closure of the academic year. The school lost two days following Storm Darragh in December, four days due to snow and ice and five days following last week’s power cuts. School attendance at the school – designated as disadvantaged or Deis – has “collapsed”, he says, after making significant progress over recent times. Teachers are also under pressure to catch up with literacy and numeracy targets. The school isn’t alone. By the end of last week some 322 schools had been without power for a week. Numbers fell to 150 early this week – mostly in the Galway, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon area. On Thursday of this week a single school in Curry, Co Sligo was without power. A total of about 10,000 homes, meanwhile, have yet to be reconnected. A spokesman for ESB Networks said “full restoration is within our sights”. Many school leaders, however, say they feel they were left adrift by authorities with little contact or evidence that their needs were being prioritised since the storm hit. Some say there is an urgent need to provide emergency access to generators or to ensure schools are at the front of the queue for reconnection in the event of future power outages. “It’s caused consternation,” says one deputy principal of a school in Mayo, who asked not to be named. “Students were facing into mocks and parents were stressed out. We weren’t able to give any guarantees when power would be back.” While power is back, the enduring effects of closures linger. “The school day and year is short, the curriculum is broad and the needs of the children are extensive,” Loftus says. “We’ve been shocked at the impact [of school closures]. When children are not in school, we can’t progress their learning to the targets we have. We have a significant cohort of disadvantaged children – Roma children and others. “Attendance is something we work really hard on. But when you lose that connection with school it takes a long time to build it back up.” To make up for lost tuition time, he says in-school teacher training and sports activities are being postponed to allow for “class contact catch-up time”. There is lingering frustration, meanwhile, among school leaders. Principals say they accept adverse weather conditions will pose challenges, but many feel urgent lessons need to be learned to ensure schools are not left for weeks without power. “There will be other storms and I don’t want to close for a fourth time. If schools can’t get power restored quickly, can there be access to generators?” Loftus says. Minister for Education Helen McEntee said this week she has asked her department to see how authorities can work more quickly to get a better picture of the volume of schools affected and provide speedy access to generators where possible. A spokesman for ESB Networks said it appreciated the frustration of school communities and it had worked closely with the Department of Education to make progress in the face of “unprecedented” circumstances. For now, Loftus says, staff are left asking where schools stand in the eyes of authorities. “We’re an award-winning school in sport and music with a range of highly successful initiatives in literacy and numeracy. It’s for these reasons we feel so strongly about feeling locked out of our school, without any urgency on the part of Government to respond to our plight. “It makes you feel you’re less significant despite the role we play in the lives of children. Rural schools were left to drift. Would this happen in Blackrock in Dublin? I don’t think so.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ondo Finance Launches Tokenized RWA-Focused Layer-1 Blockchain
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/02/06/ondo-finance-unveils-layer-1-network-for-tokenized-assets
Time Published: 2025-02-06T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
New York, NY — Ondo Finance, the second-largest tokenized Treasuries issuer, said it plans to start its own layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized real-world assets in a bid to connect traditional capital markets with decentralized finance, the company announced on Thursday at its inaugural Ondo Summit. Ondo Chain was crafted to meet institutional compliance standards while maintaining the transparency and accessibility of public blockchains like Ethereum, the company said. The network will rely on permissioned validators to verify transactions and ensure accurate financial data, such as asset prices and token backing. It will also support staking of tokenized real-world assets and native bridging between blockchains for interoperability. "Financial markets are overdue for an upgrade," CEO Nathan Allman said in a statement. "We’re creating an ecosystem that bridges the best of traditional finance with blockchain technology.” ONDO, the native token of the ecosystem, saw volatile swings following the announcement, dipping 1.5% before rallying 3.5% higher. Soon following the announcement World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, invested $470,000 in ONDO tokens, blockchain data showed. "We really set out to build something that could combine the best of both traditional finance with its incredible deep liquidity and investor protections with all the benefits of DeFi with its open access and innovation and new primitives," Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo, said during a presentation at the Ondo Summit in New York City on Thursday. "However, as we set out on this mission, we realized that the necessary conditions to really bring together really did not exist. The infrastructure to bring these two together really was not present" The announcement comes the day after Ondo unveiled a tokenization platform that helps place stocks, bonds and funds on blockchain rails. Allman said that he believes that with a new administration in place, it could take two to three years to achieve meaningful adoption for tokenized real-world assets. Tokenization, or the creation of digital tokens that represent ownership of traditional assets on a blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring the process in pursuit of operational efficiency gains like speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. The tokenized RWA market could grow to trillions of dollars through this decade, reports from McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein have projected. Recently, several influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, said bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future and urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for security tokens. Vlad Tenev, co-founder and CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood, said tokenization could democratize access to private equity investment, which is currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals, and proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized asset investments for retail investors. Ondo Finance is the second largest issuer of tokenized U.S. Treasuries offerings, according to rwa.xyz data. The protocol's U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) and Short-Term US Government Bond (OUSG) tokens stand at $385 million and $268 million market capitalization, respectively. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 15:36 UTC): Adds quotes and ONDO price move. UPDATE (Feb. 6, 2025, 17:50 UTC): Adds World Liberty Financial's ONDO token investment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Rebound Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:APOG) stands against the other rebound stocks. The United States economy is in a constant state of flux. In recent weeks, moderated growth, evolving monetary policies, and significant trade developments have impacted the overall outlook for the economy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) anticipates a deceleration in US economic growth, projecting a decrease from 2.6% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025. This slowdown is expected to be mitigated by monetary policy easing, with policy interest rates projected to decline by an additional 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2025, aligning rates toward neutral levels. Contrastingly, Goldman Sachs offers a more optimistic outlook, forecasting a 2.5% growth in US GDP for 2025, surpassing the consensus estimate of 1.9%. Chief US Economist David Mericle emphasizes the diminishing recession fears, noting that inflation is trending back toward 2%, and the labor market has rebalanced but remains strong. However, potential policy changes, including increased tariffs and reduced immigration, could influence this trajectory. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Recent trade policies have introduced uncertainties into the economic landscape. President Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, has led to swift retaliatory measures and heightened fears of a global trade war. Major stock indices, including Germany's DAX, France's CAC, and the UK's FTSE 100, experienced declines. In the US, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures indicated drops as well. Analysts express concerns that these tariffs could increase consumer prices, affect corporate profits, and potentially lead to recessions in both Mexico and Canada. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs are revising their economic forecasts, considering potential court injunctions against the tariffs, and evaluating broader economic impacts, including inflation hikes and growth decreases.

Title: 'It's a disaster': Students missing college and carers late for appointments due to ghost buses

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. BUSES BEING CANCELLED or not showing up as scheduled are causing people in Dublin to be late for work or school, politicians have warned. There have been multiple reports of certain buses on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland being cancelled with little notice, as well as so-called ‘ghost buses’ that appear to be en route – based on information on the app or bus stop signs – but never turn up. Issues have been reported with a number of routes including the N6 (Finglas to Kilbarrack via Ballymun), N2 (Clontarf Road to Heuston Station), S6 (Tallaght to Blackrock) and S4 (Liffey Valley to UCD). A number of issues have also been reported with routes which are part of the latest phase of the rollout of BusConnects services, which was launched on 26 January. People Before Profit Councillor Conor Reddy, who represents the Ballymun-Finglas area, told The Journal ghost buses are “a city-wide problem”. Multiple people have contacted him about ghost buses and cancelled services, saying they have been late to work or college as a result. “It’s having a real impact. I had calls yesterday from two carers who are from Ballymun but work in the Coolock and Kilbarrack areas – it meant that they couldn’t make care visits on time. “When you’re on the clock, if you’re home-help, it can have a huge consequence for the person that you’re caring for, as well as a very limited allocation of time given over to them. So, it’s been a disaster.” #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF— Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais (@OireachtasNews) February 5, 2025 #Dáil Topical Issue 3: Paul Murphy @paulmurphy_TD - To the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine - To discuss bus services provided by Go Ahead Ireland. #SeeForYourselfhttps://t.co/TvtNmjTv4T pic.twitter.com/aRaX2GsiOF People Before Profit TD for Dublin South West Paul Murphy also raised the issue in Dáil last night, saying he had been “inundated with complaints about Go-Ahead buses not showing up”. “Cancellations and ghost busses have been an ongoing issue with these privatised routes, but in the last few weeks it has gotten absolutely ridiculous. “A UCD student contacted me to say he was late for lectures three days in a row because of cancellations, delays, and overloaded S6s that didn’t stop. He says, ‘Many young people like me are considering buying cars because public transport is so unreliable’.” Advertisement Go-Ahead Ireland, which operates several bus routes across the Greater Dublin Area, confirmed it is aware of the issues and apologised to passengers. A spokesperson for the company said the service disruptions are due to staffing issues and illness. “There is currently a shortage of mechanics impacting transport operators nationally. “This issue has been further aggravated by seasonal illnesses which has reduced the current number of active mechanics able to service our fleet at a given time.” Reddy believes some of the recruitment issues are because of “poor pay and conditions”, saying it’s a consequence of privatisation of bus services. The Go-Ahead spokesperson told The Journal the company has been running “a dedicated mechanics recruitment campaign offering a comprehensive and competitive package for candidates”. As well as the recruitment campaign, Go-Ahead is investing in its apprenticeship programme and “exploring alternative candidate pools outside of Ireland to fulfil our rosters as soon as possible”, they added. This is not the first time there have been issues with bus services operated by Go-Ahead. In 2023, the National Transport Authority (NTA) imposed performance-related penalties of €1.1 million on Go-Ahead and just over €3 million in 2022. A spokesperson for the NTA said the organisation “is monitoring the situation closely, and is receiving daily reports from Go Ahead”. “The operator expects this to continue to improve in the coming days. The Authority has requested a remedial plan from the operator to include details of when services are expected to return to full timetable on each route.” Speaking about the ongoing rollout of BusConnects services, Reddy said he is “in principle, fully supportive of the idea” and its goal of improving connectivity across Dublin. However, he said that while some areas are benefitting, others have been left behind. The councillor said older people or people with disabilities in Ballymun are struggling to access services, for example. “There are large parts of Ballymun where people have to walk 15 minutes or more to get to one of the new bus routes. “So there was an opportunity, I think, with BusConnects that was missed – an opportunity to reconnect parts of Ballymun that had a bus service in the past with the new network, and it wasn’t taken unfortunately.” Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: House bill seeks to curb corporate purchases of single-family homes (FL)

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/06/2025 4:35:56 AM PST by Jacquerie A House bill filed on Wednesday would limit corporations and investment firms from buying up single-family homes and converting them into rentals, giving local governments the authority to restrict investor-owned housing. The Strengthening Home Ownership in Florida Act (HB 401), filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, seeks to protect homeownership opportunities by keeping more properties in the hands of individual buyers. The measure allows counties and cities to zone land exclusively for owner-occupied homes, preventing large-scale rental conversions in certain areas. It additionally creates a new classification, “single-family hybrid housing,” which applies to homes primarily used as rentals and owned by corporations, investment groups, or related entities. Under the proposal, an individual or related entity cannot own more than three single-family properties in a county and still qualify for residential zoning. Local governments would have broad authority to enforce these rules through zoning and land-use regulations. Under the bill’s purview, municipalities could prohibit hybrid housing in designated areas while still allowing it elsewhere. The bill also includes exemptions for builders and developers, allowing them to construct and sell new homes without restrictions as long as the properties are unoccupied and intended for sale.

Title: Federal workers have to make their decisions on buyout offers today
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-workers-decision-deadline-buyout-offers-uncertainty-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T12:31:08Z
Full Content:
Happy almost Friday! Google's reversal of its promise not to use AI for weapons or surveillance led some employees to run to their meme generators. "Are we the baddies?" In today's big story, it's the last day for federal workers to decide if they want to accept President Donald Trump's buyout offers. What's on deck Markets: Citi shows no signs of joining Wall Street's RTO trend. Tech: Silicon Valley's new favorite buzzy term is "high agency." Business: Some burned-out doctors are ditching the operating room for the board room. But first, are you in or are you out? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a critical day for one of the most ambitious and unprecedented ways President Donald Trump is shaking up the federal workforce. Today marks the deadline for millions of government workers to accept the new administration's deferred resignation offer. BI's Ayelet Sheffey and Juliana Kaplan spoke to some workers mulling their options and grappling with questions about how the buyouts will actually work. Chief among their concerns are the impact the offer will have on retirement plans, how it will be affected by a potential government shutdown, and why they can't get more time to decide. Trump's buyout offer isn't completely unheard of. In fact, it looks pretty similar to Elon Musk's 2022 takeover of X. The key difference is that the public sector is known for its job stability, which may be why the offer is causing so much drama among its workers. The other elephant in the room is what'll happen if not enough workers resign. The government is aiming for 5-10% of its more than two million workers to take the deal. As of Tuesday, more than 20,000 workers had taken buyouts, but the Office of Personnel Management told BI it expected a large spike in the final runup to the deadline. The Department of Government Efficiency is staying busy in the meantime. The US Agency for International Development is Trump and Musk's latest cost-cutting target. The agency's staff was notified earlier this week that all personnel except for a few essential workers would be placed on administrative leave on Friday. BI's Noah Sheidlower has a breakdown on how the foreign aid agency, which distributed nearly $32.5 billion last year, spends its money. Speaking of money, the group that controls government payments — the Treasury Department — is also in Musk's crosshairs. President Trump gave Musk's DOGE access to the government's payment system, which caused quite the stir. The White House has maintained DOGE is limited to "read-only access" and its work on the Treasury plays into DOGE's overall mission of reducing government waste. But that hasn't eased concerns over the potential impact on a system that manages trillions in payments, including Social Security and tax refunds. It's the latest example of the incredible power the world's richest man appears to hold within the US government. House Speaker Mike Johnson isn't worried, though. He defended DOGE's role and said there is a "gross overreaction in the media" over how Musk is trying to cut spending. Jamie Dimon says he didn't run for president because he knew winning the White House would mean barely seeing his family for four years. 1. Palantir stock is on a hot streak, but Wall Street's not biting. Palantir stock surged 28% after it reported a strong Q4 earnings beat, putting it up almost 35% this year. Even so, few analysts are bullish on it. They're concerned about Palantir's high valuation and skeptical it can grow enough to maintain its current stock price. 2. Working for Citi doesn't mean having to go into the city. Wall Street titans are leading the charge with RTO mandates — except Citigroup. On a quarterly call with executives last month, CEO Jane Fraser emphasized hybrid work and mentioned it could give the bank a competitive edge when it comes to recruitment. Regardless, the company is still shelling out $1.2 billion for its new London office. 3. The advisor behind BlackRock's alternative assets expansion. Bob Steel, vice chair of boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, has a laundry list of career achievements: two-time bank CEO, Goldman partner, and US Treasury undersecretary. More recently, Steel gave longtime friend Larry Fink some advice on BlackRock breaking into alternative investments. In a chat with BI, Steel explained his process with Fink and shared some wisdom for up-and-coming bankers. 1. Broke: "disruptor." Woke: "high agency." Silicon Valley has a new buzzword to describe the successful, smart, and self-motivated. It's called "high agency," and it's everyone's favorite new label. 2. It's not "RIP Temu and Shein" anymore. The two retailers disrupted the e-commerce industry by avoiding paying duty on shipments through a provision of customs law called Section 321, also known as de minimis. Many thought Trump's recent executive order closing that loophole would be a death knell for the companies. Temu and Shein will suffer a blow — but it might not be as bad as many initially thought. And if you recently placed an order, it should be fine. 3. DeepSeek's low-cost AI revolution isn't here … yet. When it burst onto the scene with its cheaper-to-build and cheaper-to-run models, DeepSeek was expected by some to revolutionize the entire AI startup system. That hasn't happened yet. Cloud providers are having trouble offering customers access to DeepSeek at fast and reliable speeds, slowing down the big switch to low-cost AI that startups had hoped for. 1. Doctors facing burnout may ditch the stethoscope. Tech companies are looking to bolster their credibility, especially with health innovation, and doctors are pitching in. Chief medical officers make $275,000 a year on average in the US — and don't have the crazy hours doctors normally deal with. Some say these corporate roles let them have a bigger impact on an otherwise "broken" health system, even amid a looming physician shortage. 2. Disney's game plan, in Iger's words. The company's sports streaming moves have been a roller coaster ride full of similar-sounding names — Venu and Fubo and Hulu, oh my! The abundance of options makes it difficult for consumers to understand Disney's sports strategy, a point an analyst raised on the company's earnings call. CEO Bob Iger clarified the goal is to make ESPN "as accessible as possible" and gave a little more insight in response. 3. "Moneyball" author Michael Lewis thinks the sports betting boom could become a mess. In 2018, gambling and media companies approached sports betting with caution. Today, gambling apps are met with little resistance, and college-aged men are getting in on the action. BI's Peter Kafka spoke with Lewis about how sports betting went mainstream — and what the fallout could be. 100,000 eggs were stolen from a supplier in Pennsylvania amid rising prices.

Title: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Lead To ‘Pain In Under 2 Years,’ Warns Arthur Hayes
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/us-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-terrible-idea-arthur-hayes/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
In his latest essay entitled “The Genie,” crypto entrepreneur and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes denounced calls for a United States Bitcoin Strategic Reserve (BSR), warning that such a program would create “unnecessary pain in under two years” and transform the world’s largest cryptocurrency into a potent political weapon. Hayes also cautioned the industry against pursuing what he deems to be an overcomplicated “Frankenstein crypto regulatory bill,” which, he argues, would primarily benefit large centralized institutions rather than foster true decentralization. Hayes questions both the feasibility and the long-term consequences of establishing a national Bitcoin stockpile. He argues the US government would be motivated by politics rather than sound financial strategy, potentially leading to manipulation of the Bitcoin market. In his view, a BSR risks becoming a mechanism for politicians to raise funds for unrelated agendas: “Let’s assume that Trump is able to create a BSR. The government buys one million Bitcoin, as suggested by US Senator Lummis. Boom! The price goes nuts. Then, the buying concludes, and the up-only trend channel stops.” Hayes envisions a subsequent administration—one hostile to Bitcoin or crypto in general—deciding to liquidate this enormous reserve. “What if [the Democrats] got a veto-proof majority in the House of Representatives? By 2028, what if a Democrat won the election … finding easy piles of cash to spend on goodies for their supporters is the first directive. There are one million Bitcoin just sitting there, ready to be sold… The market would rightly fear when and how these Bitcoin would be sold.” Another of Hayes’ key contentions is that regulation shaped by special interests could inadvertently stifle the very innovation it aims to promote. According to Hayes, large exchanges and financial intermediaries with the resources to influence lawmakers are more likely to drive regulatory outcomes. This, he suggests, will burden smaller innovators and strengthen the position of major centralized players: “The crypto regulatory wishes likely to be granted… will be in the form of overly complicated, prescriptive rules that only large and wealthy centralized companies can afford… Is that what the broader crypto community actually desired from the genie? … Maybe those readers who are shareholders of Coinbase and BlackRock want a Frankenstein crypto bill. But I believe this type of regulation does nothing to alter the status quo.” Rather than a BSR, Hayes proposes a more radical and complex financial arrangement involving the US Treasury, Bitcoin, and “century bonds” (100-year zero-coupon bonds). His idea is for the US to unilaterally devalue its existing Treasury obligations by announcing that Bitcoin will replace sovereign debt as the neutral global reserve asset. The plan, in his own words, would involve a public statement from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, declaring the intention to use Bitcoin as the reserve asset while retaining the US dollar as the invoicing currency. Afterward, the Dollar would undergo a progressive devaluation, with the US Treasury bidding for Bitcoin at increasingly higher prices while issuing century bonds instead of immediate cash payouts. The next step would be extending the maturity of Treasury debt, with the Treasury selling Bitcoin at a profit to buy back and retire shorter-term obligations, ultimately pushing US debt maturity to 100 years. Additionally, global USD adoption would be accelerated through stablecoin transfers on social media platforms like Facebook and X, enabling everyday users to participate in US bond markets—bypassing conventional banking intermediaries. “That’s it for the financial history… The additional new goal is to make Bitcoin the global neutral reserve currency,” Hayes explains. He believes such a strategy could restore US hegemony by transitioning from the traditional “petrodollar” or “Treasury-based” system to one anchored in Bitcoin, all while ensuring large swaths of Bitcoin’s mining operations remain within US borders. In a more cautionary afterword, Hayes highlights that crypto voters played a notable role in returning Donald Trump and the Republican Party to power. Yet he stresses the slow pace of action on crypto issues, contrasting it with the administration’s rapid implementation of tariffs and rollbacks of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. “When Trump wants to act, he acts… The removal of ESG and DEI policies… came swiftly… That’s a shame because on the margin, the crypto single-issue voter put [the Republicans] in power.” He also reiterates his forecast that Bitcoin could see a sharp correction to a range of $70,000 to $75,000 before rallying higher in the long-term —if there is no immediate, concrete legislation favoring permissionless innovation or further monetary stimulus. For now, Hayes urges those “lining up day after day dressed in a seersucker suit or block heels and a summer dress hoping to ask the orange genie for a wish” to think carefully: “Stacking sats is my game, and I hope yours is too. Therefore, if you find yourself at the genie’s table… please wish for the right things.” At press time, BTC traded at $98,190.

Title: BlackRock plans to launch a Bitcoin ETP in Europe

BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is gearing up to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. The step marks another significant step in the firm’s expansion into the cryptocurrency market and is set to be registered in Switzerland. This move follows the resounding success of BlackRock’s $58 billion US Bitcoin ETF, which by early February 2025 had gathered $57.5 billion in net assets. This alone speaks volumes about the investor appetite for such products. CEO Larry Fink’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against currency debasement, suggesting a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value. This European venture is anticipated to attract both institutional and retail investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. The decision to domicile the ETP in Switzerland was strategic, leveraging the country’s reputation as a hub for digital asset innovation, particularly within its “Crypto Valley” in Zug. Switzerland’s progressive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has made it an attractive location for BlackRock to extend its Bitcoin investment offerings beyond North American borders. The choice of Switzerland not only aligns with BlackRock’s aim to capitalize on crypto-friendly regulations, but also positions the firm to lead in the European market. Notably, the plans to launch an ETP in Europe comes at a time when the European Union is navigating its own regulatory path through the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was established in 2023. The MiCA framework aims to ensure consumer protection and market integrity, providing a stable environment for crypto investments. Despite the European crypto market capitalizing at $17.3 billion — far less than the US’s $116.4 billion — BlackRock’s move could significantly boost the sector. BlackRock’s entry into this market underscores the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, a trend that has been further propelled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.

Title: BlackRock Said to be Preparing to Launch Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Product in Europe

Photo Credit: Bloomberg BlackRock's IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion as of February 4 BlackRock is gearing up to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe within weeks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid growing demand for exposure to cryptocurrencies from both money managers and consumers. The product will likely be domiciled in Switzerland, the source added. The Wall Street giant has incorporated a Zurich-based company focused on digital assets - iShares Digital Assets AG - in recent months, according to a regulatory filing seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment. BlackRock was one of the first institutional investors to offer exchange-traded products to track the spot price of bitcoin after the US Securities and Exchange Commission first approved them in January 2024. The SEC's move was a watershed moment for the asset class, boosting hopes in the crypto industry that cryptocurrencies would become more widely integrated in mainstream finance. BlackRock's main bitcoin-linked product IBIT has grown rapidly, amassing net assets of $57.5 billion (roughly Rs. 5,03,523 crore) as of February 4, according to BlackRock's website. However, not all global investors can access the existing US-domiciled products. Bloomberg was first to report on BlackRock's plans in Europe. While the US crypto industry has celebrated Trump's election and his pledge to support the sector, crypto businesses in Europe are facing new, tougher regulation. The European Union's landmark crypto regulatory framework, known as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) was introduced in early 2023 and is in the process of being rolled out. © Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Title: Most Promising Altcoins to Buy as First Avalance and Cardano ETPs Appear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-as-avalance-and-cardano-etps-appear/
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:16:44Z

Swedish asset manager Virtune launched Avalanche ($AVAX) and Cardano ($ADA) exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Finnish market. Previously, Virtue rolled out $BTC, $SOL, and XRP ETPs, as well as the Crypto Altcoin Index ETP, which gives exposure to the top 10 cryptos at once. The demand for crypto among European investors is evidently growing, which suggests the bull run is far from over. Virtue’s ETPs could push $AVAX and $ADA to new heights due to accelerated adoption and set a precedent for other fund managers to launch altcoin products. In light of this news, we share the five most promising altcoins to buy now. The market cap of Solana ecosystem tokens grew 120% last month alone. That’s a double-edged sword because Solana isn’t ready to handle such a surge in activity. Solaxy ($SOLX) could help Solana handle this ever-increasing workload by offloading part of transactions to its Layer-2 chain. In fact, this is the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that connected Solana with Ethereum. Solaxy’s goal is to speed up processing, lower fees, and eliminate congestion on the Solana mainnet. This would allow more projects to launch on Solana without compromising user experience. The project’s native token, $SOLX, is now available on presale at $0.001626, but the price will increase in 23 hours. Early adopters have invested $18.2M so far and staked 5B tokens at a 222% APY. Autonomous agents are a new wave of AI evolution. Unlike bots that only follow pre-programmed instructions, AI agents can make decisions, solve problems, and learn independently. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends this next-gen technology with the viral appeal of Pepe the Frog. As a self-sovereign agent, MIND of Pepe analyzes data from crypto aggregators and social media to gauge market trends and sentiment. As a result, MIND of Pepe can deliver unbiased, real-time trading insights to its community, engage in discussions with other users, and launch its own tokens. $MIND token holders will gain exclusive access to the agent’s knowledge and governance rights. With one token worth $0.0032662, now is the best time to join the community. Analysts expect $MIND to explode after major exchanges confirm its listings, so the first adopters are up for the highest returns. Best Wallet is the fastest-growing crypto wallet ecosystem currently on the market, rapidly approaching its goal of capturing 40% of the market by 2026. This non-custodial hit wallet lets you store (obviously), buy, sell, swap, and stake assets across several blockchains. But its standout feature is the Token Launchpad, which gives access to all of the best presales from one app. The $BEST token presale hit the ground running recently and already generated $9.2M in funding, most of which will go toward the platform’s improvement. With a price of $0.023875, set to increase in 13 hours, there will be no better time to secure your share of tokens than now. Litecoin ($LTC) struggled to reach its former highs in 2024, but 2025 might be different. The main catalyst for its anticipated growth is new $LTC ETPs in the US and European markets. US asset manager Canary Capital recently filed an application for an $LTC ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fast-tracked it through the first stage of the review process, so it might launch in spring. $LTC is also part of Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP because it meets the strict criteria of the Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe index. Uniswap is the world’s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) with an over $2T cumulative trading volume. Its native token, $UNI, is also featured in Virtune’s Crypto Altcoin Index ETP and has a $5.6B market cap. $UNI is now trading -79.24% below its all-time high of $44.97 recorded in 2021. Yet, institutional capital inflows from products like Virtune’s ETP might revive the token and the entire Uniswap ecosystem. While Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently surpassed $UNI by market cap, the platform’s developments and institutional interest might drive it to new heights. The launch of altcoin ETPs attracts institutional capital into their respective ecosystems and the crypto industry as a whole. In the long term, this should drive innovation and increase crypto’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. This confidence trickles down to presales like Solaxy and Best Wallet Token, which can attract a wider pool of investors, including those previously hesitant to participate in early-stage projects. However, remember to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. Even projects with strong fundamentals don’t guarantee returns. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meet Bob Steel, the Perella investment banker and former Treasury undersecretary who is advising Larry Fink on his alternative investment buying spree
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-steel-perella-weinberg-investment-banker-advising-blackrock-fink-alternatives-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-06T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Robert Steel has had the kind of career most people on Wall Street only dream about. He spent 30 years at powerhouse investment bank Goldman Sachs, where he rose to partner before "retiring" in 2004. In 2006, he became undersecretary of the US Treasury under President George W. Bush and helped prepare the government's response to what became the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. He stepped in as CEO of troubled bank Wachovia during the darkest days of that crisis and later served as Deputy Mayor for economic development of New York City under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Since 2014, Steel has helped lead boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg, first as CEO and now as vice chairman. Last year, he helped the firm score a role as a top advisor to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, in its expansion into alternative assets. Specifically, Steel worked with longtime friend Larry Fink on two recent acquisitions tied to BlackRock's expansion into investments traditionally reserved for the uberwealthy: Its $12.5 billion purchase of private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and its $12 billion purchase of private-credit giant HPS Investment Partners (HPS). Steel said BlackRock's latest acquisitions were driven by its leadership's conviction that time was of the essence. "I think the BlackRock people had what I would describe as a pretty courageous point of view that the opportunity was, for now, significant," he said, adding: "So they'd rather not take the time to build. They'd rather buy and be a strong participant right away." The spate of deals, including a $3.2-billion acquisition of data provider Preqin, has led some on Wall Street to describe Blackrock's ambitions as potentially game-changing. Marc Rowan, the CEO of private-equity giant Apollo Global Management, recently pointed to the deals as evidence of a new investment paradigm that will meld the realms of publicly traded stocks and bonds with so-called private investments. "Our industry grew up where I think people thought private was risky and public was safe," Rowan said on a quarterly earnings call. BlackRock, he added, "has delivered a wakeup call to their entire peer set that private is going to be an important part of client solutions going forward." Business Insider sat down with Steel to talk about his long and storied career, his recent work helping BlackRock expand into alternative assets, his advice to the next generation of bankers, and why retirement is not on his to-do list. Steel and Larry Fink, BlackRock's founder and CEO, have been friends for about 20 years. They first got to know each other around 2006, Steel said, while he was Treasury undersecretary in Washington. They've supported some of the same causes over the years, including as cosigners of a public letter in support of Mayor Adams' public safety and crime reduction efforts in 2022. They're also both on the executive committee of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that seeks to maintain the city's position as an economic and cultural hub. Steel said he got involved in Blackrock's expansion when Fink invited him and his team to assist with a non-alts project that "didn't come to fruition," without saying what it was. Steel and Perella soon became part of the team Fink relied on for advice about expanding into alternative assets. "When he was thinking about people to help with these transactions and give him advice, he thought of me and our firm," Steel said. Given Steel's long history with Wall Street, he ended up knowing people on both sides of the transactions. HPS was co-founded by Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, while GIP's chairman, Adebayo Ogunlesi, was previously a Goldman board member. "This was a case where I knew the people in BlackRock, I knew the people at GIP, and I knew the people at HPS," he told BI. "So I was involved intensely all the way through." In describing his role in the deals, he said: "I wasn't writing documents and arguing with lawyers, but I was basically trying to provide momentum to the transaction and to understand the pros and cons and the challenges. And I think I was pretty central to that." A BlackRock spokesman confirmed Perella's role in the HPS and GIP acquisitions and declined to comment on whether the firm plans to buy more companies in a space that Fink has called "critical" to the firm's growth. "Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets," Fink said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. "And blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities." Steel said he came from "a very middle-class background" in Durham, North Carolina, with no connections to Wall Street. As a student at nearby Duke University, he had little interest in finance. "I steered away from math and science and quantitative things in undergraduate school," said Steel, who majored in history and political science. Eventually, that changed. He started in institutional sales at Goldman Sachs in 1976 (and remedied his quantitative knowledge by enrolling in the University of Chicago's nighttime MBA program a few years later). Ever since, Steel said, the biggest theme of his career has been collaboration and teamwork. He pointed to the late 1980s, when he and his team at Goldman launched an ECM division in Europe, as an example. "The idea of setting strategy for equities and then finding the right people to help lead and execute that was pretty extraordinary," he said. "Goldman Sachs was not very well known in the continent, and we built businesses and built a brand, and I think were pretty successful." Steel was soon made a Goldman partner, and about six years later, he moved back to New York to co-lead the US Equities Division. "I was lucky enough to be in a place where the firm was growing and creating new opportunities where I don't think I had one job for 30 years — I think I had half a dozen jobs for five years," he said. While Goldman taught Steel teamwork, Washington DC taught him about working under fire. "You're doing a lot of things for the first time and you don't really know what's going to work, what's not going to work," he said. "So trying to figure that out so you can hopefully prevent something like a mean-spirited recession is a lot of responsibility, and so that was a pretty challenging time." Moving from the private to the public sector also required adjustments in other ways. He explained that authority in the corporate world is clearly assigned, ending with the CEO. In government, authority is shared due to checks and balances. "When you're solving the same puzzles in the public sector, that success generally comes more slowly and takes more time and often requires a bit of compromise — different than the corporate world," he said. Steel was CEO of Perella between 2014 and 2019, and the firm worked on some notable transactions during that time, including AT&T's $108.7 billion purchase of Time Warner in 2016 and iHeartMedia's $16 billion bankruptcy restructuring in 2019. As vice chairman, Steel is part of Perella's board of directors and helps with the strategic direction of the firm along with Chairman Peter Weinberg, a founding partner, and Andrew Bednar, who took over the CEO role from Weinberg in 2023. Although Steel, 73, has certainly earned the right to retire, he told BI he has zero interest in spending his days on a golf course or lounging at a beach. "I'll take time away over the holidays, but the idea of doing nothing seems pretty uninteresting," he said. "I think the goal is to wear out, not rust out." "I have friends that are really happy at a different rhythm, and I have no judgments," he said. "But it wouldn't be for me." Steel, however, appreciates the flexibility the pandemic has introduced to the corporate world, including banking. Early on in his career, he said, the pressure behind constant face time was, at times, overkill. "I think 'presentism' is maybe a bit overvalued. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be focused, committed, and available, but the idea that every day I had to be in before my boss and stay until after he left," he said, "I think that's moderated a bit, which I think is a good thing." His main advice to young people is to become an integral and irreplaceable part of your company or team. He said you must think beyond the day-to-day tasks to get there. "Thinking about how what you're doing fits into a bigger picture and understanding that perspective is a good tool," he said. Jump to
