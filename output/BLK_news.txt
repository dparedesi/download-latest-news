Recently, there has been an unprecedented influx of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, with data showing billions in record-breaking monthly inflows. The Ethereum ETF spot approval and rising DeFi dominance have continued leading the way as institutional money keeps flowing in. However, with the inflow comes a surge in attention to Ethereum top tokens such as AAVE, Remittix, and Ethena. But with these tokens seeing renewed pump, here is a look into Ethena price direction and what AAVE price prediction looks like this month. The Ethereum ETF has continued extending its rising Ethereum ETF inflow with a record 17-day extension. Ethereum’s global reach with the ETF has also continued pushing the token closer to a new bull breakout as traders eye $4,000. However, fundamental factors have proven instrumental in the rising Ethereum price as new announcements keep adding to the large inflow. One of the latest updates analysts are eyeing lately is the news of Deutsche Bank’s tokenization platform on Ethereum. Therefore, with new projects such as the BlackRock BUIDL fund and Sharplink Gaming, experts remain bullish on rising inflows to Ethereum. Top AAVE price prediction speculates a 100% rise before November this year. The bullish season is a factor experts believe could boost the AAVE price as Ethereum leads the altseason. Moreover, as institutional traders continue moving millions into Ethereum, AAVE price prediction continues to stand stronger. However, while a whale withdrawal last week gave the AAVE price prediction a shakeup, new Metamask integration is renewing the hope. This is a new AAVE Price prediction suggests a potential high of over $500 before the end of the year. Ethena price surge joined the ranks of the major breakouts last week, with a bullish stretch recording over 140% in the last 30 days. The Ethereum rising inflow is projected to see the Ethena price hit a new high this year, with a target $1.50. The Ethena price setup shows 3 bullish candles breaking out above the 50 SMA on the weekly chart, fueling bullish sentiment. A growth in Ethereum staking yield is projected to see Ethena price rise to $4 before mid-2026. Remittix is another Ethereum token growing to be the best this year, with utility and adoption. While Remittix is new to the ecosystem, its fast climb in the last few weeks shows it could soon take over the market. This includes a breakout surge in presale already hitting $17.9 million, making it the best crypto presale of 2025. The Remittix solution is not feeding off hype, but rather on a solidly built utility that analysts believe could be the future of crypto payment. Below are some of the features making Remittix stand out at the moment: With Remittix set to launch in the coming weeks, experts forecast up to 30x in breakout after hitting the exchange.

Title: Ireland’s Cliodhna Moloney-MacDonald: ‘We want to leave a legacy from the World Cup’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/01/cliodhna-moloney-macdonald-we-want-to-leave-a-legacy-from-the-world-cup-in-terms-of-our-performance-and-how-we-are-supported-by-the-irish-people/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T05:00:01Z

Two days out from the first of the two warm-up games before the Women’s Rugby World Cup in England, Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald is reflective. With 43 Ireland caps to date, she is one of the players lining out against Scotland on Saturday in Cork who was involved in the home World Cup back in 2017. “I think a lot has changed,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “The tournament structure has changed hugely. The numbers that go have changed hugely. Women’s rugby has advanced a lot. So while I might have experience – and people will be asking me questions anyway – that’s not World Cup relevant. “I’ve been around a long time, I do know a lot of players from other countries and how they play. I’ve experienced playing against a lot of other countries, even at a club level, like playing over in England [with Exeter Chiefs], I would experience playing against a lot of these teams and players from these teams.” The landscape of women’s sport and women’s rugby has exploded since 2017, and Irish women’s rugby has been on an emotional rollercoaster, with more lows than highs in that time. Through all this, the support of family, friends, and fans has remained consistent. “[The 2017 World Cup] was a huge occasion, and getting to play in front of all your family and friends, it was amazing. That’s probably something that will remain the same. We’re as close as we could be to a home World Cup so the support element will hopefully be huge.” Saturday’s game at Musgrave Park and the following Saturday’s encounter with Canada at Ravenhill have been organised to give fans a chance to see off the team in style before they set up base in England. “People can fly over from Shannon, Dublin and wherever, and there’s lots of games all over the country,” says Moloney-MacDonald. “We want to give our team a great send-off and prepare ourselves as best as possible. But we also want to get people behind us a little bit. So performance is the main goal, but we do want to feel a little bit of support and love from the Irish people before we head off.” Managing those small things will be critical for this weekend’s first warm-up game against Scotland, who beat Ireland in the final Six Nations game earlier this year. “We were disappointed at the end of the Six Nations to lose that game, it’s not one that we should have lost, we feel,” admits Moloney-MacDonald. “We’ll want to put those things right, just for our performance, like the things we got wrong that day. We want to tidy up on them. But it is more about performing as a team in the way that we want to play and the way that we want to approach this World Cup.” Every game and every opponent is different, but the guiding goal is the same: getting to Twickenham for the World Cup final. “We know what we need to do at each stage but we’re not overestimating; this week is about Scotland, next week about Canada. Then it’s selection and getting there and then it’s each game at a time, and the pool games are each going to be very challenging in their own way.” Having the World Cup so close, and hopefully performing well, could help achieve another of the team’s goals: to fuel the growth of the game in Ireland. “We do have our goals individually and for each game, and obviously we need to get there first. But obviously the overall plan and strategy and everything is about growing the game in Ireland and that’s always in the back of our mind. “When we travel over to England, the lucky ones that get to go, we want to bring the sport with us, but we also want to leave a legacy from this World Cup in terms of our performance and how we are supported by the Irish people.” IRELAND (v Scotland, World Cup warm-up, Saturday, Musgrave Park, 2pm): Méabh Deely (Blackrock College/Connacht); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Nancy McGillivray (Exeter Chiefs)*, Eve Higgins (Railway Union/Leinster), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union/Munster); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Manawatū/Leinster); Siobhán McCarthy (Railway Union/Munster), Clíodhna Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs), Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke/Ulster); Eimear Corri-Fallon (Blackrock College/Leinster), Sam Monaghan (Gloucester Hartpury/IQ Rugby) (capt); Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht)*, Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster).

Share this article Seven major asset managers – Grayscale, VanEck, Bitwise, Canary, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares – on Thursday submitted amended S-1 registration statements to the SEC for their proposed Solana (SOL) ETFs. The amendments represent the firms’ continued efforts to secure regulatory nod to expand their crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum products currently available to US investors. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and ETF Store President Nate Geraci note that the revised filings demonstrate active engagement between the SEC and ETF issuers. Not really… but clearly dialogue w/ SEC and issuers are refining prospectus language. Gotta think fees in neighborhood of btc & eth ETFs. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 31, 2025 Industry experts project a 95% probability of SEC approval for spot Solana ETFs, though prospects are unclear for products incorporating staking features. Meanwhile, asset managers like BlackRock are seeking regulatory approval to incorporate staking into their existing spot Ethereum ETFs. Geraci suggests staked Ether ETFs could receive the next regulatory approval, following the SEC’s recent authorization of in-kind redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Several organizations, including Jito Labs, VanEck, Bitwise, the Solana Policy Institute, and Multicoin Capital, are advocating for the SEC to permit liquid staking in Solana-based ETPs. Liquid staking enables tokens to maintain liquidity while being staked, providing benefits such as enhanced capital efficiency, lower ETP operational costs, and expanded security and investor options.

Title: SEC Chair Discusses American Leadership in Digital Finance — Project Crypto
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/08/01/sec-chair-discusses-american-leadership-in-digital-finance-project-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-08-01T04:01:15Z
Full Content:
It gives me great pleasure to be with you all, particularly at what I believe is a defining moment for American leadership in the crypto asset markets. Before I share a few reflections, I want to thank the America First Policy Institute for convening such a timely conversation. And, I must note, in order to keep my compliance folks happy, that the views I express here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners. *** Today, I would like to discuss what Commissioner Hester Peirce and I are calling “Project Crypto,” which will be the SEC’s north star in aiding President Trump in his historic efforts to make America the “crypto capital of the world.”[1] But before I discuss our plan for crypto market primacy, let me take a few moments to revisit some inflection points in the history of our financial markets that bear similarities to the one we are at now, so that the future we shape is worthy of the legacy that we inherit. The winds of innovation have always swept through our capital markets, often at gale force. In 1792, they rustled the leaves of a buttonwood tree, beneath which two dozen stockbrokers assembled to establish the forerunner to the New York Stock Exchange. That modest agreement—fewer than a hundred words handwritten on a slip of parchment—set in motion an elegant design that would govern the flow of capital for generations.[2] In the centuries since, our markets have never stood still. They have expanded, evolved, and reinvented themselves in step with the ideas and technologies of their time. Markets are dynamic because of the people who participate in them. Markets channel human ingenuity toward society’s most intractable problems by rewarding those who develop the most innovative solutions that others value enough to buy. They are the mechanism by which Adam Smith’s invisible hand elevates those who act in the common good—even when pursuing their own. The SEC’s role is to safeguard markets that allow the spark of human creativity and skill to benefit society. Over the arc of its history, the agency has both enabled innovation and, regrettably at times, stifled it. Fortunately, progress has a way of prevailing. And when our regulatory posture is calibrated to meet innovation with thoughtfulness rather than fear, America’s leadership position has only grown stronger. *** In the 1960s—before my time, I am happy to say—Wall Street was riding a bull market. But behind the scenes, our market machinery was straining to keep up. Most clearing and settlement transactions involved a costly and cumbersome process. Rising stacks of paper stock certificates had to be physically delivered by clerks wheeling carts up and down Wall Street and in other financial districts all across America.[3] It was a scene from another century struggling to meet the demands of the modern securities markets. Indeed, the paper-based clearance and settlement systems, built for a gentler era, began to buckle under the weight of soaring volumes. Delays at one firm held up the work of another. Securities were lost or stolen. Fails ballooned. And many thinly capitalized broker-dealers were caught by the whiplash of scuttled transactions. In desperation, trading hours were reduced and exchanges eventually closed on Wednesdays to allow firms to process the mountains of certificates. The breakdown over an antiquated system was described by the SEC chairman at the time as “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the securities industry in 40 years… Firms failed. Investor confidence plummeted.” And very much to its credit, the SEC was proactive in remedying the so-called “Paperwork Crisis.” The agency helped market participants to develop the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which would transform how securities were held and traded.[4] Instead of shuffling paper certificates from customer to broker, broker to broker, and broker to customer, title to shares could now be transferred through computerized ledger entries.[5] The certificates themselves were immobilized, stored securely in vaults, as ownership moved electronically, laying the foundation for the modern clearing and settlement system that has continued to this day. The ticker tape machine—like the one here—was also a breakthrough of its time, revolutionizing how Americans accessed market information, line by line, trade by trade.[6] But breakthroughs don’t belong in the past. By the late 1990s, electronic trading systems surged in popularity, unsettling old assumptions about how markets should function. Chairman Arthur Levitt likewise believed it behooved the SEC to provide regulatory flexibility for the electronic markets to innovate.[7] So, Regulation Alternative Trading Systems, or “Reg ATS,” adopted in 1999, allowed for ATSs to be regulated like broker-dealers, rather than like exchanges.[8] So, this brings me to today. To a moment that demands American ambition. To a project that can unleash it. Our regulatory framework need not be anchored to an analog past—unkind to new frontiers. After all, the future is arriving at full speed—and the world is not waiting. America must do more than just keep pace with the digital asset revolution. We must drive it. So today, I would like the world to go on notice that under my leadership, the SEC will not stand idly by and watch innovations develop overseas while our capital markets remain stagnant. To achieve President Trump’s vision of making America the crypto capital of the world, the SEC must holistically consider the potential benefits and risks of moving our markets from an off-chain environment to an on-chain one. We are at the threshold of a new era in the history of our markets. As I mentioned earlier, today I am announcing the launch of “Project Crypto”—a Commission-wide initiative to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, ensuring that America will continue to lead in global payments with a gold standard stablecoin regulatory framework. Upon signing the GENIUS Act into law, I was pleased that President Trump endorsed Congressional efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation by the end of the year. I commend the House of Representatives for garnering such strong bipartisan support, and I look forward to working with the Senate as they build off the House’s work and craft market structure legislation that future proofs our markets against regulatory mischief, cementing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. Yesterday, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC and other federal agencies to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. This report is the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology. The President said last week that he wants “the entire world running on the backbone of American technology.”[9] I stand ready to help get that job done. That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the PWG’s recommendations. Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”[10] Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate. In accord with the PWG Report’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to draft clear and simple rules of the road for crypto asset distributions, custody, and trading for public notice and comment. While the Commission staff works to finalize these regulations, the Commission and its staff will in the coming months consider using interpretative, exemptive, and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. Many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations do not make sense in the twenty-first century—let alone for on-chain markets. The Commission must revamp its rulebook so that regulatory moats do not hinder progress and competition—from both new entrants and incumbents—to the detriment of Main Street.[11] Now, Project Crypto will involve a broad range of initiatives across the Commission. First, we will work to bring crypto asset distributions back to America. The days of convoluted offshore corporate structures, decentralization theater, and confusion over security status, are over. President Trump has said that America is in its Golden Age—and under our new agenda, our crypto asset economy will be, too. In line with the PWG Report, a key priority of mine will be to establish—as swiftly as we can—a regulatory framework for distributions of crypto assets in America. Capital formation is at the heart of the SEC’s mission, yet for too long the SEC ignored market demands for choice and disincentivized crypto-based capital raising.[12] As a result, crypto markets pivoted away from offering crypto assets and deprived investors of the opportunity to use this technology to contribute to productive economic enterprises. The SEC’s head-in-the-sand posture—as well as its shoot first, ask questions later approach—are days of the past. Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the “Howey test” has led some innovators to prophylactically treat all crypto assets as such. American entrepreneurs are harnessing blockchain technology to modernize a broad range of legacy systems and instruments. One such entrepreneur is Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a successful businessman and freshman senator, who before his election to the Senate founded a company that put car titles on the blockchain.[13] He saw a need for efficiency in transferring titles and devised a practical solution with the new technology. These entrepreneurs need—and deserve—bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. I have directed the Commission staff to work to develop clear guidelines that market participants can use to determine whether a crypto asset is a security or subject to an investment contract. Our goal is to help market participants to slot crypto assets into categories, such as digital collectibles, digital commodities, or stablecoins, and assess the economic realities of a transaction. This approach can allow market participants to determine, based upon clear guidelines, whether any outstanding promises or commitments of the issuer cause the crypto asset to be subject to an investment contract. In addition, it should not be a scarlet letter to be deemed a security. We need a regulatory framework for crypto asset securities that allows these products to flourish within American markets. Many issuers will prefer the flexibility in product design that the securities laws afford, and investors will benefit from the opportunity to earn distributions, voting rights, and other features typical of securities. Projects should not be forced to establish decentralized autonomous organizations and offshore foundations or decentralize too early if this is not their desired plan of action. I am excited to see new use cases for crypto asset securities in commerce, such as the ability to participate in blockchain network consensus with tokenized equities. Thus, for those crypto asset transactions that are subject to the securities laws, I have asked staff to propose purpose-fit disclosures, exemptions, and safe harbors, including for so-called “initial coin offerings,” “airdrops,” and network rewards. Regarding these sorts of transactions, our goal should be that issuers no longer exclude Americans from their distributions to avoid legal complexity and lawsuits,[14] but instead choose to include Americans to enjoy legal certainty and an accommodating regulatory environment. It is my view that a Cambrian explosion in innovation could occur if we stay true to this course. Additionally, many firms seek to “tokenize” their common stock, bonds, partnership interests, and other securities, or tokenize the securities of third parties.[15] Much of this innovation is offshore today due to regulatory challenges in the United States. I also hear from our regulatory policy staff that firms—from household names on Wall Street to unicorn tech companies in Silicon Valley—are lined up at our doors with requests to tokenize. I have asked the Commission staff to work with firms seeking to distribute tokenized securities within the United States and to provide relief where appropriate to assure that Americans are not left behind. Second, to achieve the President’s goals, it is incumbent on the SEC to ensure that market participants have maximum choice when deciding where to custody and trade crypto assets. As I have said before, the right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a core American value.[16] I believe deeply in the right to use a self-custodial digital wallet to maintain personal crypto assets and participate in on-chain activities like staking. However, some investors will continue to rely on SEC registrants, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, to hold assets on their behalf, and these firms are subject to additional regulatory requirements when they do so. It will be a priority of my chairmanship to carry out the PWG Report’s recommendation to modernize the SEC’s custody requirements for registered intermediaries. The prior Administration’s “special-purpose broker-dealer” framework, SAB 121, and “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” resulted in a dearth of custodial service provider options in the market today.[17] The existing custody rules were created without crypto assets in mind. I have directed the staff to consider how best to adapt the existing regime to facilitate the custody of crypto assets, including possible exemptive or other relief, in addition to changes to the rules themselves. As the PWG Report recommends, market participants “should be permitted to engage in multiple business lines under the most efficient licensing structure possible.” We should not force market participants to be stretched to fit a Procrustean bed of regulation for regulation’s sake. I am in favor of affording them the freedom to choose the most efficient regulatory framework for their business, provided that the framework adequately protects investors. Third, a key priority of my chairmanship is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps.”[18] I am often asked, “What do you mean by a super-app?” Plain and simple: securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. A broker-dealer with an alternative trading system should be able to offer trading in non-security crypto assets alongside crypto asset securities, traditional securities, and other services, like crypto asset staking and lending, without requiring fifty-plus state licenses or multiple federal licenses. Nothing in the federal securities laws prohibits SEC-registered trading venues from listing non-securities on their platforms today, and I have directed the Commission staff to develop further guidance and proposals ultimately to make this “super-app” vision a reality. Maybe they’ll call it “Reg Super-App.” Consistent with the PWG Report, the SEC in concert with other regulators should strive to have the most efficient licensing structure for SEC registrants. They should not be unnecessarily subject to multiple regulators or regulatory regimes. This model has worked well for banks, which are broadly exempted from many duplicative regulatory frameworks, such as broker-dealer and clearing agency registration. Regulators should provide the minimum effective dose of regulation necessary to protect investors while allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to flourish. We should not overburden them with paternalistic regulation that could drive them offshore or make American companies less competitive internationally. Our regulators should unleash the forces of venue and product competition for the benefit of all Americans. We should not artificially constrain business models and impose duplicative regulatory costs on American businesses that favor the largest firms that are better able to bear the regulatory burdens. Per the PWG’s recommendations, I have directed the Commission staff to develop a framework that will allow non-security crypto assets and crypto asset securities to be traded side-by-side on SEC-regulated platforms. Additionally, I have asked the staff to evaluate the use of Commission authority to permit non-security crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract to trade on trading venues that are not registered with the Commission. I am keen to pursue such a solution, as it will not only enable state-licensed crypto asset platforms that are not registered with the SEC to list certain crypto assets, but it also clears the way for CFTC-regulated platforms to offer these products with margin capabilities—even without Congress providing the CFTC with any additional authority, unlocking even greater liquidity for these assets. Fourth, I have directed the Commission staff to update antiquated agency rules and regulations to unleash the potential of on-chain software systems in our securities markets. On-chain software comes in many shapes and sizes—some of these systems are truly decentralized and not operated by any intermediary. Other on-chain software systems have an operator. Both types of on-chain software should have a place within our financial markets. It is essential that any crypto asset regulatory market structure create a path for software developers to unleash on-chain software systems that do not require operation by any central intermediary. Decentralized finance software systems—like automated market makers—facilitate automated, non-intermediated financial market activity. Federal securities laws have always assumed the involvement of intermediaries that require regulation, but this does not mean that we should interpose intermediaries for the sake of forcing intermediation where the markets can function without them. We will create space in our markets for both models, by protecting pure publishers of software code, drawing reasonable lines to distinguish intermediated and disintermediated activity, and creating rational and workable rules of the road for intermediaries that seek to operate on-chain software systems. Decentralized finance and other forms of on-chain software systems will be part of our securities markets and not drowned out by duplicative or unnecessary regulation. To make this vision a reality, we will need to consider some changes to our rules. For example, accommodating trading of tokenized securities on-chain may require us to explore amendments to Reg NMS, in addition to what we otherwise would do in the normal course to correct market distortions that it engenders. Many of you will remember that I co-authored with Commissioner Cynthia Glassman a lengthy dissent to the adoption of Reg NMS twenty years ago last month.[19] This dissent is even more compelling now that we have had two decades of prescriptive requirements that distort market activity and impede the evolution of our securities markets. Congress clearly intended that “competitive forces, rather than unnecessary regulation, guide the development of the national market system.”[20] I will look for ways to bring us back in line with that intent and thereby promote innovation and competition in our markets. Finally, innovation and entrepreneurialism are the engines of the American economy. President Trump has described America as a “nation of builders.”[21] Under my leadership, the Commission will encourage our nation’s builders rather than constrain them with red tape and one-size-fits-all rules. While the Commission is actively considering industry requests that could jumpstart innovative activity, we are also contemplating an innovation exemption that would allow registrants and non-registrants to quickly go to market with new business models and services that do not neatly fit within our existing rules and regulations. The Commission will continue to ensure that market participants adhere to certain conditions and requirements designed to achieve the policy aims of the federal securities laws. Under my vision for an innovation exemption, innovators and visionaries will be able to immediately enter the market with new technologies and business models but will not be required to comply with incompatible or burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity. Instead, they will be able to comply with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the Commission, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality, and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features, such as ERC3643.[22] I encourage market participants and SEC staff alike to have an eye towards commercial viability when contemplating what various models could look like. *** As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working with my counterparts across the Administration to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. This represents more than a regulatory shift—it is a generational opportunity. From the leaves of a buttonwood tree to ledgers on a blockchain, the winds of innovation still blow—and it is our task that they carry American leadership forward. After all, ladies and gentlemen, we have never been content to follow. We will not watch from the sidelines. We will lead. We will build. And, we will ensure that the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America. Thank you very much for your time today. I encourage you to be attentive to our coming announcements and proposals and, as always, I welcome your thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Title: SOS — Save Our Shipping: Trump must break China’s chokehold on global trade
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/sos-trump-must-break-chinas-global-shipping-chokehold/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T23:59:58Z
Full Content:
A high-stakes deal that would give an American company a major role in running dozens of strategically crucial global ports is now in limbo — as China aggressively demands a stake. The United States cannot let that happen. US asset manager BlackRock and its partners are vying for 43 of the world’s most important shipping ports, including the two that straddle the Panama Canal. The seller is C.K. Hutchison, a major Hong Kong operator that is one of China’s “big three” port giants — and the only one not owned outright by the Chinese government. Prying these ports from China’s oversight is a critical move for both US national security and the global economy. Now the Chinese Communist Party is trying to block the deal, unless its state-owned COSCO joins the buyers’ group and gains veto rights over port operations. Alarmingly, all three main parties are reportedly open to letting that happen, apparently thinking that a compromised deal is better than no deal at all. But with all that’s at stake, President Donald Trump should use every tool available — starting with the ongoing US-China trade talks — to push the original deal through and keep COSCO out. The 43 ports that Hutchison seeks to sell would launch a global liberation from oppressive Chinese surveillance and control. If the plan falls through — or if it’s altered to add COSCO to the ownership group — China could tighten its grip on the global shipping system, by replacing a Beijing-influenced company with a Beijing-controlled one. While the media has dubbed this the “Panama Canal deal,” it’s actually much bigger. The canal, a vital artery that runs through the center of the western hemisphere, is certainly critical — but many of the other ports involved in the deal are equally so. For example, this deal would include a port inside the Malacca Strait, the only direct maritime pathway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It sees 90,000 ships and $3.5 trillion worth of global trade every year. Hutchison is also looking to sell five ports that it owns on both sides of the Suez Canal, the preferred maritime commercial route between the Asian and European markets. About 12% of global trade, $1 trillion a year, passes through Suez. As China’s purchases of sanctioned Iranian oil draw greater US scrutiny, Hutchison’s four ports on the southern side of the Strait of Hormuz are also critical. Nearly all Iranian oil must pass through the strait, along with oil and gas from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. In Europe, Hutchison controls 13 ports that act as a key entry point for Chinese goods into the European Union. The original deal would reduce China’s port foothold on the continent — and the geopolitical influence that comes with it. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Like all major commercial deals, this one is complicated. Apart from the two Panama Canal ports, BlackRock would retain 20% ownership of the remaining facilities; its partner, Europe-based Mediterranean Shipping Corp., would control 70%, with Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owning the rest. Meanwhile, China’s power in global shipping is massive. China produces 95% of world shipping containers and all of the refrigerated ones. Ports around the world are plugged into China’s logistical software platform, LOGINK, which tracks sensitive trade, market, maritime and passenger data. Huawei’s “Smart Port” 5G telecommunication towers provide Wi-Fi — and ready surveillance capacity — at ports worldwide. A Chinese state-owned company makes more than 70% of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes (and 80% of the cranes used in America) — a major risk, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, which has alleged those cranes may be engaging in covert surveillance on behalf of the CCP. Adding state-owned COSCO to ports deal would give the CCP the power to veto any attempts to replace Huawei towers, LOGINK systems, Chinese cranes or other tools that may already be spying on behalf of the state. With BlackRock’s minority interest in the vast bulk of these ports, replacing a private Chinese company with a state-owned one is even worse for the United States than the status quo. Breaking China’s maritime monopoly is urgent. At the same time, America’s economic leverage has never been higher. As Beijing trumps up patently absurd anti-monopoly investigations to stall or scuttle the BlackRock-MSC deal, the United States should Trump right back. He must make the choice clear: Access to American markets cannot continue unless Beijing releases its maritime monopoly.

Title: Biden Aide Mike Donilon Claims He Had No Clue About Autopen
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/31/mike-donilon-joe-biden-james-comer-house-oversight-autopen-mental-decline/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T21:11:46Z
Full Content:
Mike Donilon, a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden, told congressional investigators he had no knowledge of the autopen or its use, a source familiar with his testimony told the Daily Caller. Donilon appeared Thursday before the House Oversight Committee as part of Chairman James Comer’s probe into Biden’s mental fitness and the administration’s use of the autopen. He had advised Biden since 1981, serving as a pollster, strategist and media consultant during Biden’s Senate tenure, according to his Harvard Institute of Politics biography. (RELATED: ‘A Great Candidate For Republicans’: James Comer Has Fun Predicting Kamala’s Future Job Prospects) Mike Donilon is in the hot seat today. Let’s get some answers. https://t.co/vN39PdlGZ1 — Oversight Committee (@GOPoversight) July 31, 2025 Donilon told the committee he stood to make $8 million from Biden’s reelection bid — half already paid out, with the rest contingent on a 2024 victory. He reportedly downplayed concerns over Biden’s debate performance, saying critics in the media and on Capitol Hill had overreacted. He conceded the former president’s presence was sometimes diminished and that he occasionally stumbled over words, but expressed frustration with the public’s fixation on Biden’s appearance. Donilon reiterated he had no knowledge of the autopen or how it was used. He previously served as counselor to then-Vice President Biden and led strategy, polling, messaging, advertising and speechwriting for Biden’s 2020 and 2024 campaigns. (RELATED: Oversight Committee Moves To Subpoena The Clintons, Comey, Garland And Others In Epstein Probe) Key co-conspirators in Biden’s cognitive cover-up Mike Donilon & Steve Ricchetti facing Congress this week House Democrats were core accomplices in hiding Biden’s presidential incapacity from the American people, the fraud of the century! They must be held accountable. pic.twitter.com/04uW3PVf3Q — NRCC (@NRCC) July 30, 2025 Former Democratic Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips previously described Donilon as one of the “ringleaders” trying to keep Biden in the 2024 presidential race, warning that figures like him are motivated by “self-preservation.” The Chairman of BlackRock Investment Institute (BlackRock’s global think tank & influence shop), who won the CIA’s Director Award and played a leading role in NATO enlargement, is on the advisory board of USAID’s political lobby arm to increase USAID funding. Meet Tom Donilon… https://t.co/OwMu0aEgYA pic.twitter.com/1tFzM4Sj5M — Mike Benz (@MikeBenzCyber) April 30, 2025 Steve Ricchetti, another longtime Biden aide, also downplayed concerns about the former president’s cognitive health during his Thursday testimony before the House Oversight Committee. (RELATED: House Oversight Committee Votes To Subpoena Ghislaine Maxwell For Deposition) Ricchetti and Donilon followed former Chief of Staff Ron Klain, who sat for several hours of questioning last week. Meanwhile, several close Biden associates — including former White House physician Kevin O’Connor, Jill Biden’s ex-chief of staff Anthony Bernal, and former aide Annie Tomasini — have recently invoked the Fifth Amendment before the committee.

By Blizzard Entertainment 9 hr 57 min ago Journey deeper into The War Within campaign in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update arriving on August 5. Explore a new zone, break ground in a new Delve, make an impact in Ecological Succession, and more. The War Within Season 3 also kicks off on August 12 with a new raid, new Mythic+ dungeon pool, and a fresh PvP season. In Ghosts of K’aresh, the campaign continues as more pieces to a troubling puzzle fall into place. With the release of this content update players will be able to immerse themselves in The War Within story as it leads up to the next chapter of the Worldsoul Saga—Midnight. There’s some unfinished business to be had on K’aresh and the specter of an old enemy looms large. Forces with ill-intent are determined to bring forth Dimensius, the All-Devouring once more to finish off the ethereals. Should he arise, Azeroth will also be in peril from this dangerous Void Lord. Home of the ethereals, K'aresh was once a vibrant world, but now it only exists as a fragmented void-touched world waiting for players to explore what remains of this little-known land. Though there are multiple points of interest for heroes to explore, including ethereal Eco-Domes where life still thrives. With shadowy forces working toward bringing Dimensius back into the world, players will need to gather their allies in a bid to put a stop to him and his followers. [LEARN MORE] Not just a dungeon in the Ghosts of K’aresh content update, Tazavesh, the Veiled Market has been brought from the Shadowlands to serve as a home base for adventurers. Glowing glimmering shields of energy protect the city from the dangers of the cosmos beyond allowing the many survivors of this land to have a degree of safety behind them. Once inside the market, find vendors, more quests, and portals. There are even portals to each of the four daily active Bountiful Delves. A coalition of Broker cartels and ethereals formed to accomplish an impossible goal—save their destroyed world from the All-Devouring. The K'aresh Trust is the seventh major faction of The War Within, and is based out of Tazavesh, located in what remains of K'aresh. Harness the power of the ethereals and see the world through their eyes. An artifact cloak, Reshii Wraps, can be used to transform into an energy form, much like the ethereals, to interact with the world in a new way. You'll use these wraps to take on a new type of content—Phase Diving— as well as use them in the Manaforge Omega raid, the open world, delves, and more! [LEARN MORE] Reshii wraps will upgrade and scale with you, including new visuals as you progress through the content. Enter untethered space by using your Reshii Wraps to experience a whole new aspect of K’aresh. You’ll experience new creatures, objectives, world quests, and some new mechanics all within this overlay of the world. You can expect to see anything you normally would in the world such as treasures, rare creatures, or objects, but there will also be some unique opportunities to be found such as Warrants. Aid the constable of Tazavesh by hunting down notorious monsters for fun… and profit. Help Ve’nari bring life back to K’aresh with her eco-domes. You’ll help fill them with creatures that thrive within the ecosystem. You’ll scour previously traveled zones to bring back animals to live within the eco-domes and aid them in adjusting to life on K’aresh. It’s up to you to help transform this barren eco-dome into one filled with life and promise for a new future. [LEARN MORE] Manaforge Omega, built to harness arcane power from the wastes of K’aresh, now hums with a sinister radiance. Within it, Nexus-King Salhadaar attempts to reawaken Dimensius, the All-Devouring, in a bid for ultimate power. The champions of Azeroth must disrupt Manaforge Omega’s operations or else risk a reborn Dimensius feasting on reality itself. [LEARN MORE] Raid Bosses Those bold enough to vanquish Dimensius, the All-Devouring, will earn the prestigious Royal Voidwing on Heroic difficulty—and for those who conquer him on Mythic, the elusive Unbound Star-Eater awaits. Upper Left: Royal Voidwing Lower Right: Unbound Star-Eater Manaforge Omega will also have a Raid Renown Track called Manaforge Vandals, similar to the Gallagio Loyalty Rewards Club, filled with rewards like The Bone Freezer mount, and buffs to use once inside the raid. Dungeon Bosses The new seasonal rewards for Mythic+ include the two new titles: "the Unbound" and "the Unbound Hero", dungeon teleports, and two mounts: Azure Void Flyer and Scarlet Void Flyer. Scarlet Void Flyer Starting the week of August 12th, Tazavesh will also return as a full hard mode mega-dungeon and will count as a Mythic+10 once a week in the Great Vault. This mega-dungeon replaces the Mythic 0 difficulty for the season for both Tazavesh dungeons, and can be accessed by entering the Tazavesh instance and with all players in the party interacting with Al'dalil near the dungeon entrance to confirm they're ready to proceed. All bosses have a chance to drop Hero track loot, and completing the mega-dungeon will also grant players 30 Gilded Crests. An additional weekly reward is available for players who are able to defeat all bosses in the mega-dungeon without anyone in the party dying. Checkpoints are also evolving into Waystones, with a more visual representation of unlock checkpoints. A new icon will appear on the map showing you where Waystones within the zone can be found as well. Found within the Azure Vaults within the Dragon Isles, you’ll encounter ethereals, ethereal pirates, and brokers who are plundering the Delve. Upgrading and using the Reshii Wraps unlocks unique challenge gateways to powerful bosses and reveals hidden secrets when you revisit your favorite delves across Khaz Algar. You may also get a glimpse of your friends within the Delve as well or even /mourn them as you observe their ghost from where they died. There’s unfinished business with Nexus Princess Ky’veza as well and you’ll take her on one on one as this season's Nemesis. Delver's Mana-Skimmer Delver's Mana-Skimmer Schematic: Hyperdrive Along the Delver's Journey progression, unlock customizations for your Delver's Mana Skimmer–the newest Delve mount attainable during Season 3–and two new toys, the Delver's Mana-Bound Ethergate–opens a portal to return to the Explorers' League home base in Dornogal, and Etheric Brannmorpher–summons an Ethereal Transmorpher that can change your appearance. The ethereals of K'aresh first witnessed this destructive maw of the void after Dimensius's attack. They believe Reshanor has manifested as their eternal punishment - for it comes back around to keep eating them and their planet as he grows infinitely bigger over the years. From left to right: Death Knight, Warlock, Rogue From left to right: Paladin, Demon Hunter, Druid From left to right: Hunter, Priest, Warrior From left to right: Shaman, Evoker, Mage, Monk With a new season, also comes a new set of class gear. These new sets will feature set bonuses that will align with your chosen Hero Talents instead of your class or specialization. Astral Gladiator's Fel Bat The new season also brings a new PvP Ladder, increased item level gear, and new rewards: Arena title: "Astral Gladiator", Rated Solo Shuffle title: "Astral Legend", Rated Battleground Blitz title: "Astral Marshal" (Alliance) or "Astral Warlord" (Horde), a new weapon illusion: Arcane, tabard, cloak, pennants, weapon appearances, Astral Gladiator's Fel Bat, and new Vicious mounts–Alliance and Horde-themed Void Creepers. Several PvP talents will be updated with the content update; players will also be able to undertake a new World Quest to vanquish their foes on Vanquisher’s Wake island. This new point of interest is a perfect spot to hang out for those seeking to go toe-to-toe in some outdoor PvP battles. No quest required for entry. Simply turn on War Mode and enter with caution.

Title: A 13% Dividends From AI? Here Are The Tickers
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/07/31/a-13-dividends-from-ai-here-are-the-tickers/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T21:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. By now you’ve no doubt heard the argument that AI is a bubble, and there’s no way Big Tech will make a significant profit from it, given the massive amounts of cash they’ve already piled in. That take is just plain wrong—truth is, the tech giants are already booking profits from AI. And we closed-end fund (CEF) investors can grab our share at a discount—and at dividend rates running all the way up to 13%, too. This next chart tells us straight-up why the “AI-is-unprofitable” theory is off the mark. Look at the far left of this chart and you see that communication-services stocks led in profit growth in the second quarter of 2025. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) are both titans of that sector, and both have invested billions in AI. They’ve largely done it by buying chips and other hardware, as well as software, from IT firms like NVIDIA (NVDA). That pop in communication-services earnings proves that these companies are profiting from AI. Similarly, the second-highest earnings gains in the chart above, in IT, confirms that AI actually does make money for Big Tech. When it comes to high-yielding, tech-focused CEFs, there are basically four tickers that income investors look to. Let’s check in on those now. As you can see in the chart below, all four of these funds’ net asset values have been roaring higher, with the 12.3%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in green, leading by a small amount over the last three months. It’s followed closely by its sister fund, the 7.7%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple. The BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), with its huge 13% yield (in blue), and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK), (in orange and paying 6%) bring up the rear. The interesting thing, however, is the fact that these funds still trade at discounts to net asset value (NAV). The best values are the three BlackRock funds (again in green, blue and purple): We’ve seen BSTZ’s discount remain basically where it was three months ago, despite its strong NAV return in that time, while BST’s discount has widened slightly, despite its strong performance. The third BlackRock tech CEF, the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), has seen its discount narrow slightly (April was a great time to buy BTX). The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) is the priciest of our quartet, but context matters here, as its premium to NAV, which it has held for much of the last decade, suddenly disappeared. Let’s stick with STK for a bit. Despite that fund’s smaller discount, is it still worth our time? I’d say yes, given the next chart. But there is a caveat that we’ll get into shortly. Before we get to that, we see that STK, whose NAV (in purple above) has closely matched the NASDAQ 100 (whose benchmark index fund is shown in orange) over the last decade. That makes STK a good way to get tech exposure, plus the index’s diversification. I mention that diversification because STK is tech-heavy, with core names like Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA and Apple (AAPL). But like the NASDAQ, it also branches out a bit, with holdings in companies like Visa (V) and Bloom Energy (BE), which focuses on products that help customers generate power on-site. On the dividend side, STK’s 6% yield far outruns the NASDAQ’s 0.5%, and the CEF has also never cut its payouts. However, STK is contending with funds yielding a lot more—up to 13% in the case of the highest-paying BlackRock fund, BTX. That’s the real reason for STK’s growing discount: Even though it was swept up in the tech rally, its lower payouts aren’t enough for many income investors, now that there’s more competition, plus dividends that nearly double STK’s 6% yield, among tech CEFs. This is why the bigger discounts offered by the BlackRock funds are the better deals here, and why STK’s discount isn’t yet big enough to warrant our attention.

Title: Panama says it could take over ports as it threatens to upend $20B deal with BlackRock, MSC
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/business/panama-says-state-could-take-over-ports-as-it-threatens-to-upend-20b-deal-with-blackrock-msc/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T20:47:24Z
Full Content:
Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday the Central American nation could potentially take over two key ports along the canal — a move that would scupper US asset manager BlackRock’s bid to gain control of the vital shipping lane. Mulino asked the nation’s top court to scrap a contract with current operator CK Hutchison, which would then allow Panama to forge its own public-private partnerships for the two ports. CK Hutchison has agreed to a $20 billion deal to hand over more than 40 global ports owned by Hong Kong business magnate Li Ka-Shing to BlackRock and Mediterranean Shipping Company. CK Hutchison owns a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which has given it control over the Balboa and Cristobal ports located at both ends of the canal. It renewed that agreement – planned to last 25 years – in 2021, but has since proposed a sale of the ports to appease President Trump’s demands for the US to “take back” the waterway, citing national security concerns. While Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run business MSC is slated to be the lead investor, the two Panama ports included in the deal will go to BlackRock, according to Bloomberg. Panama’s Comptroller General’s office filed two lawsuits this week asking the Supreme Court to declare the sale unconstitutional and to nullify its contract with CK Hutchison, claiming the operator did not follow required steps – like getting it greenlit by the comptroller. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino said at a press conference Thursday. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added on the lawsuits. MSC, CK Hutchison and the White House did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. It’s not the first time Panama’s comptroller has taken aim at its contract with CK Hutchison, arguing that there were irregularities from the previous government and that the deal has brought insufficient revenue to Panama. The results of a recent audit by the comptroller’s office have not been released. Every morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here! China has also pushed back hard against the BlackRock deal, fearful of losing critical access to the Panama Canal. Beijing officials have threatened to squash the sale unless Cosco, China’s largest shipping firm, gets a stake equal to those of BlackRock and MSC, according to the Wall Street Journal. Tensions have continued to heat up as China and the US negotiate on a trade deal. Panama’s government said state partnerships could also solve the problem of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

Title: Panama Brings 'Abusive' Ports Contract with China-Linked Company to Supreme Court
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2025/07/31/panama-brings-abusive-ports-contract-china-linked-company-supreme-court/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T19:12:04Z
Full Content:
Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores filed two separate lawsuits on Wednesday against a contract between the country and Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, over the “abusive” contract that grants PPC control of two ports at the Panama Canal. The lawsuits, filed at Panama’s Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ), demand that the decades-old contract be rendered null and void over the “many irregularities” that his office found in detriment of national interests during a months-long audit of the company and its management of the two ports. “The duty of this Comptroller’s Office is to defend the money of Panamanians and always be on the side of the best national interest,” Flores said during a press conference presenting the lawsuits on Wednesday. “That is why today we are referring directly to the Supreme Court, appealing to them as the Panamanian State and as comptroller in these two lawsuits. We hope they will be admitted promptly and that we will have the results that the country obviously needs and that the citizens are waiting for.” Since 1997, PPC, a subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. One of the ports is located at the Pacific entrance to the canal in Balboa and the other on the Atlantic side of the trade route in Cristóbal, in the province of Colón. At the time, the administration of former Panamanian President Ernesto Pérez Balladares granted a 25-year lease to PPC for the management and administration of the two ports. The original 1997 contract reportedly contained automatic lease renewal provisions invoked in 2021 to grant PPC an additional 25-year lease period that will run through 2047. Flores, who took office in 2024, claimed in April that the renewal did not have the endorsement of the Office of the Comptroller General, refuting statements issued by his predecessor Gerardo Solís, who claimed otherwise. The two ports have been at the center of an ongoing debate started by President Donald Trump last year after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal — which the United States originally built and ceded to Panama in 1999. President Trump and several members of his administration have denounced China’s alleged growing influence in the country and control of the interoceanic trade route. International outlets have described PPC’s parent company, HK-based Hutchison Port Holdings, as an “example” of China’s presence in the trade route after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020 that prevented Beijing from imposing communist laws in Hong Kong through a “national security” law intended to suppress democratic protests. The law effectively outlawed anti-communist dissent and imposed Beijing’s law, which gives the Party total control over supposedly “private” businesses. The Office of Panama’s Comptroller General has audited PPC during the past year over its management of the two ports. The audit reportedly revealed evidence of multiple breaches of contract that amounted to more than $300 million in losses to Panamanian state coffers. At the time, Comptroller Flores accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of misrepresenting financial figures related to PPC and its management of the ports. Flores stressed during his press conference that Panama’s relationship with PPC has been “harmful” and his office seeks to correct the “historical damage” caused to the Central American nation. The comptroller general said he hopes that the nation’s Supreme Court promptly admits both lawsuits and that the judicial process yields results that “respond to the public outcry.” “We Panamanians do not agree with or approve of what the country has been through,” Flores reportedly said. Flores denounced this year that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described the situation as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez deemed the PPC contract “unconstitutional,” arguing that its terms stood in violation of fundamental principles of Panama’s constitution. At press time, Hutchison Port Holdings’ parent company CK Hutchison Holding is undergoing negotiations with asset manager Blackrock and other companies over the sale of the two ports as part of a broader sale of 43 ports spread across 23 countries. Panamanian President José Raul Mulino expressed his support for Comptroller General Flores’ legal action in remarks given during a press conference Thursday morning. Mulino denounced the contract, its 2021 renewal, and how much it has “cost” the country. “The Comptroller’s lawsuit, which I fully support, is well justified. We have all seen what that contract has cost the Panamanian nation over time. What we have not gained from it, apart from the fact that we are 10-percent shareholders, is a very, very paltry sum,” Mulino said. “When that contract was renewed for another 25 years, the Comptroller did not endorse it,” he continued, “and that is what is being challenged in court, the nullity of the contract because it was not endorsed as all contracts between the State and any third party must be endorsed.” On the subject of C.K. Hutchinson’s sale of the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, Mulino said that the negotiation “is at a standstill as far as we know.” “Remember that this is a broad process. There are 41 ports around the world that are being sold, and the two ports in Panama are in a separate process. So one thing has nothing to do with the other,” Mulino said. “The Republic of Panama will definitely adopt a port policy which we will announce in due course with the aim of enforcing what I mentioned about the canal,” he continued, “a coherent maritime and logistics strategy for the Panamanian state, in all its services, civil servants, etcetera, so that we can truly take advantage of the privilege of our strategic geographical position.” Christian K.

Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Reuters) – Public-private partnerships could take over two key ports near the Panama Canal if courts invalidate a contract with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison‘s to operate them, Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino said on Thursday. CK Hutchison holds a 90% stake in the local Panama Ports Company, which had a 25-year concession to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports, located at both ends of the canal, renewed in 2021. The contract has been at the center of a dispute since U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the waterway due to China’s influence over Panama’s maritime industry. CK Hutchison is trying to sell its stake in the Panamanian company as part of a massive global deal. Two suits were filed with the Supreme Court this week by Panama’s Comptroller General’s office, aiming to declare the agreement unconstitutional and to nullify the contract on the basis the renewal did not follow required legal steps, including the Comptroller’s greenlight. “I do not at the moment see the continuation of the Panama Ports contract, amended or not,” Mulino told a press conference. “We will wait for the verdict,” Mulino added, referring to the lawsuits. The comptroller has openly criticized the contract over alleged irregularities by the previous government and insufficient revenue to Panama from the deal, but the full results of a recent audit by his office have not been revealed. The legal challenges the contract is facing in Panama are adding troubles to a diplomatically sensitive plan from a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock BLK.N to buy a large portion of CK Hutchison’s global ports business, a possible deal that has been celebrated by Washington but criticized in China. The deal has become increasingly politicized amid a U.S.-China trade war. Beijing argues it has significant national interests in the transaction and the proposed deal would be a betrayal of the country. Panama’s government is also seeing partnerships with the state as a solution for the operation of a key copper mine previously operated by Canada’s First Quantum Minerals FM.TO, whose contract was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2023. “The idea is still a draft, covering the ports and the mine through partnerships with the state,” Mulino said.

Title: July 2025 in Review

The Site WordPress.com hasn’t changed up anything dramatically this month. Nothing here to get angry about. They have still broken things however, so there is still some minor disappointment. Back in January I mentioned that WP.com had introduced Activity Pub integration, which let you connect your blog directly with the Fediverse, so that it would appear on, allow people to follow it, and auto update for users of services such as Mastodon. Pretty cool. You could even leave a comment on the blog from Mastodon, which was honestly easier than trying to leave a comment here without logging into a WP.com account. I had a couple of problems with it on this blog, and turned it off in March as it was causing problems with Discord. But I let it run with my other blog, EVE Online Pictures, because its format was quite well suited to the integration. And so it appeared in the Fediverse. EVE Online Pictures – Fediverse Version Granted, nobody actually followed it, which is about par for the course for the 17 years that blog has existed. There is no broad interest in EVE Online screen shots. It would get a like now and then… but even that seemed to dry up in June. And then I discovered that WP.com broke the whole Activity Pub thing, so the likes stopped because the integration stopped working after June 11, 2025. This corresponded with an update to the blog settings for WP.com hosted blogs and there does not seem to be any way to get the integration running again. I cannot even turn it off and back on again, the most basic of trouble shooting, because the on/off option has gone missing. One Year Ago There was the end of the Steam Summer sale, which always prompts me to summarize my gaming so far in the year. There was also Pokemon Go Fest 2024. My wife and I also made it to level 46 in the game. Enad Global 7 bought the struggling title Palia and assigned it to Daybreak. Meanwhile, the EQ and EQII producer’s letters gave hints about their fall plans. Playable Worlds, having announced Stars Reach, put the game up to wishlist on Steam and got on all the usual social media sites. Then there was the start of the pillars posts, followed by more pillars, and then even more pillars. It was like the Acropolis. I played a bit more Tarisland. In EVE Online the Guristas took over the Alliance Tournament XX sponsorship. The AIR daily goals got a change up while CCP made it clear that the “farms and fields” idea for null sec was over. There would, once again, be good space and bad space in null sec. This got Asher to write an open letter to CCP about their plans, which got endorsements even from our traditional foes. I did a Friday bullet points post about CCP announcements around Equinox, Vanguard, Carbon, ATXX timeline updates, and actually getting mentioned in the Community Beats post. Meanwhile I was still on about shuttle destruction in the MER and CCP introduced the weekly 15K skill point injector for Omega accounts. The latter gets you an extra 780K skill points a year if you remember to redeem them. I also sold a SKIN on the Paragon Hub. In game we were out in the Dronelands shooting the new Skyhooks. While out there I narrowly averted disaster when I jumped to the Fraternity staging beacon. Then the invasion of far Catch began in what was the start of the Imperium’s plan to move eastward. PanFam and Fraternity didn’t seem concerned even as we dropped a Keepstar on grid with one of their in U-QVWD. With Cataclysm Classic we bowled over Blackrock Caverns in our second try. Then, because we missed a quest, we went back and did it again as a foursome. Along the way an alt hit level cap. Over in retail, the pre-patch for The War Within landed. There was also the World of Racetrack vision of WoW. In Valheim I made it to the Ashlands, mostly out of my grudge against it. Having gotten there and tested it out I was done. I started back in No Man’s Sky. You start out in trouble and then work up from there. There was the warm up to Blaugust 2024. Finally, WP.com was being awful, because that is what they do best. Five Years Ago The 2020 Steam Summer Sale finished up. I bought some things. In TorilMUD, aging was abolished. And a good thing too! SSG was compensating people for outages in Lord of the Rings Online. Minecraft gave us the Nether Update. I went out and found a crimson forest in the nether. I was reflecting on Diablo II at its twenty year anniversary. We didn’t know for sure there would be a remaster at that point. Blizzard was getting us more details about the Shadowlands beta and launch. In WoW Classic the instance group was finishing up Zul’Farrak and then meandering about Maraudon, which we finished up on our second run. Blizzard was banning botters in classic while getting ready to open up the Ahn’Qiraj war effort event. As part of the anti-botting effort they were limiting the number of instances players could spawn in a day, but we were at least getting some extra bag slots. CCP cancelled their San Diego player event as Covid did not look to be going away any time soon. I also resigned myself to the fact that, despite past promises, CCP was going to keep selling skill points in EVE Online. (I’d feel better if they stopped being so dumb about it.) In game we saw the launch of the Zenith Quadrant, the first part of which was a small update to command ships, and official support for the capsuleer cemetery at Molea. The June MER showed that mining was shifting to high sec after the resource changes. But the bulk of my posts in July were about the opening of World War Bee, which I chose to list out rather than try to create a paragraph narrative: It was kind of a big deal at the time. Ten Years Ago I was feeling a bit of the summertime MMO ennui blues. Windows 10 launched, bringing with it the Microsoft Solitaire Collection. This wasn’t your Win 3.1 Solitaire or Freecell, and more is the pity. Project: Gorgon was off with another Kickstarter campaign. Would the third time be a charm? (Spoiler: yes) Need for Speed: World shut down, so I said farewell to Palmont. Derek Smart began what would become is crusade against Star Citizen, detailing why he felt we would never see the game that was promised. It could have ended there, but RSI responded in a way guaranteed to turn it into a fight and took away his Rear Admiralty. Game on! In Minecraft I was learning about not falling off of things, bringing light to dark places, and accumulating materials. Also, sheep stole my mine cart. I was mucking around in War Thunder for a bit. It is a pain to return to the game because there is always a huge update required. Over at Daybreak, there was a vote up for the EverQuest progression server Ragefire about speeding up the unlock of Ruins of Kunark, as well as talk about raids and such. On the EverQuest II side of the house, there was a beta for its first nostalgia servers. I avoided the beta but was there when the servers went live… for the big surprise, the return of the Isle of Refuge, adding to the nostalgia experience. And while that was going on, it appeared to be the end of Smed at Daybreak. In New Eden my alliance, TNT, handed over its last system in Deklein. We then lived in Tribute. The Aegis expansion hit… but there was a delay between that and other bits of what we now call Fozzie sov to be deployed. But entosis link modules were finally able to take sov as the month rolled along. So we started to learn by doing. There was a plan in the Imperium to bring in care bears to mine and rat in order to raise ADMs so that our now much reduced space holdings would remain secure. At one point Mordus Angels managed to claim some sovereignty in Pure Blind! Can you imagine? Crazy times! Meanwhile, in the cash shop… erm… New Eden store, more skins were being rolled out. Or, rather, the same skin on more ships. The blog banter of the month was on about attributes, and I was bitching about never having enough jump clones. On the Azeroth front, Blizzard said they would be announcing the next World of Warcraft expansion… right after the Q2 quarterly report was released, which raised some suspicions in me. What would the subscription numbers look like if they felt they needed a big announcement to distract from them? And I finally got my copy of Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls from the Kickstarter… only two years late. Fifteen Years Ago The late Paul the octopus created the then largest page view day ever in the history of the blog, later to be surpassed by Cats playing Patty Cake and Alamo. Actually writing about games is never popular. I was told I write like Cory Doctorow… or maybe Ian Flemming. My daughter was Banned from Club Penguin. Tears were shed, lessons were learned. EverQuest II Extended, the free to play EverQuest II, was announced. I wondered whether trying to play it without paying at all would be a challenge in and of itself. Meanwhile, there was some evidence that EQII accounts had value. That stunning news no doubt got them going on the authenticator they announced at Fan Faire this year. I completed 100 levels in The Agency: Covert Ops. I was unemployed, what can I say? StarCraft II launched. I never bought a copy and the base edition eventually went free. It never surpassed the original in popularity and Blizz eventually just stopped doing content for it, though like many old Blizz titles, it does get a patch once in a while to keep it playable. Need for Speed World, an MMO version of the Need for Speed series, launched. I ended up playing it for a bit. But, being an EA MMO, it was doomed to be shut down. In EVE Online Hulkageddon III ended, and it even had a video wrap-up. And then PLEX was made transportable in space. I wonder if they waited for Hulkageddon to be over for that? In another Summer hiatus season, the instance group started another run at LOTRO. This time it was Bung who was out, having the dual issues of moving and having a new baby to care for. Those of us in Middle-earth hung out with old friends. That put off deciding who my main character was, by letting me roll another one! Blizzard gave up on some of their RealID plans thanks to much public kvetching. Shortly there after, the ESRB came out against Real ID as being bad for consumer security while proving they too were bad for consumer security. Blizzard revamped Parental Controls again. As much as I have griped about them, they are better than any comparable controls I have seen, even in games that offer that as a feature. World of Warcraft Magazine issue #2 showed up. Issue #4 would arrive 9 months later, which is kind of a long time for an alleged quarterly publication. Once issue #5 was finally out, the whole thing was shut down. And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons? Twenty Years Ago Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas gets rated adults only (AO 18+) and the company faces sanctions when the hot coffee mod unlocks a hidden mini-game that existed in the product which allow the protagonist to have sex with his girlfriends. Unlike some other infamous graphic mods, this one was not fan created content, but something the company put into the game. In EVE Online the Cold War expansion hit, bringing freighters, dreadnoughts, and player owned outposts (“Permanent” caputurable stations, not to be confused with Player Owned Starbases, the doughty POS that remains to this day) in null sec. Those stations are gone, but remembered via special faction Fortizars. Forty Years Ago The Amiga 1000, the first in the line of Commodore’s Amiga series of computers, is debuted. Launched in an era when DOS users were still working from a command prompt and Mac users could run exactly one program at a time, the Amiga brought performance, multitasking, multimedia, and high resolution graphics to the masses. Later versions of the Amiga, combined with the Video Toaster software package, would do for video production what the Macintosh and the laser printer did for desktop publishing. Forty-Five Years Ago Atari releases Missile Command to arcades, one of the iconic titles of the era. Not the first arcade title to use a trackball, but it certainly helped cement the trackball as an input device. It hasn’t been ported/copied onto as many platforms as Tertis, but it has never gone away either. Most Viewed Posts in July Search Terms of the Month what is rimworld [Oh my, where to begin?] rimworld odyssey worth it [Maybe… but you have to leave your base to play it] rimworld unable to reach parking spot [I am not sure…] why is it called rimworld [Why are you called Steve?] rimworld lossless scaling [Why would you want this?] rimworld on ipad [Maybe through Steam Link] rimworld skilled in everything to an unnatural degree [Did you win then?] Game Time by ManicTime and iOS EVE Online topped the list for July. I’ll get into that below. Also, WoW Classic is back… a bit. I mean, we had the pre-patch all month. And LOTRO… well… I did get to Mordor. I’ll always have that. Enshrouded The group has made some effort to get together and do a few things, but it is summer and people have things to do on the weekends. We did make some progress, including getting to the spire in the Albaneve Summits. We’re not ready to fight the dragon yet, but we should be able to mount an expedition to get the blast furnace once we’re all around. EVE Online I ended up playing a lot in New Eden, if “playing” is the right word. I didn’t go on a lot of ops… though there were plenty to go on… but I had plenty to do in finishing up the move, starting with filtering down all the stuff in my hangar. I had piled so much in there that I went over the item limit. So there was some inventory management time. Also some ship reassembly, including some Epithals, which are used to haul PI materials, because it was also time to get my PI back online, as the market had started to recover. And then I stuck an alt in an Ishtar and did Forsaken Hubs for a couple of days, just to earn some ISK. That is probably worth a post soon. Pokemon Go My focus for the month was largely around trying to advance some achievements to get to platinum level as that is going to be the biggest barrier. I knocked out a few, but I am still 10 shy and I am close to being done with the easy ones. Meanwhile, my wife is still level 47 because she still needs to walk 25km in a week… something she totally does, but she leaves her phone sitting on the desk or counter while doing so. Like I said, keep your phone in your pocket to get steps! RimWorld With the launch of the Odyssey update I grabbed a copy of that and went and played some RimWorld for a few days. It is still a fine answer to the question, “What do I do with six hours of free time on a Saturday afternoon/evening?” You can sit there for hours fiddling with your colonists and their base. It is also kind of amusing to see the start points for the different DLC paths pop up. But after a few days of dealing with the problems of my colonists, I decided to step back from it again. It is engaging but not entirely satisfying for me now. WoW Classic Oh, and stepping back from RimWorld might have coincided with Mists of Pandaria landing in WoW Classic. I got my Pandarian out of the tutorial and did some pet battles, but with the opening of the expansion I jumped right in… literally… you jump and parachute into the expansion as part of the opening. It has, however, been kind of slow going… though I remember that being the case back in the day as well. The Jade Forest is not the best zone in the expansion. We’ll see if I carry on, or if the group decided to take a panda vacation from Enshrouded for a bit. Coming Up Well, as I have mentioned a few times, it will be Blaugust 2025. Expect some posts to go along with that, starting tomorrow. At the back end of the month will be Gamescom, and Blizz is expected to announce a couple of things… like maybe the timeline for Midnight and when housing might become a thing in WoW. Fantasy Critic League will carry on, though my next title to launch isn’t until September. So I’ll be in last place for a while still. Otherwise, it will be the usual stuff. In EVE Online we might get a hint about the next expansion and we might be about due for another update in Enshrouded… though I suspect that will come closer to November. “And somebody was trying to make yet another flying car that failed to live up to our expectations. Have none of these scientists ever seen The Jetsons?” Worth the price of admission, right there. Thanks for the giggle!! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

In total, Tenev referenced tokenization 11 times, while also mentioning Robinhood’s stock tokens on a handful of occasions. The digital assets, which offer synthetic exposure to private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI, were unveiled for European users in June, alongside company ambitions to build its own Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. During the hour-long broadcast, Tenev invoked tokenization within five minutes, a term used to describe the process of representing real-world assets using tokens on a blockchain. In some ways, the episode mirrored Facebook parent Meta’s pivot away from the metaverse in 2023, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg referenced artificial intelligence 20 times on an earnings broadcast. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” saying investors will benefit from 24/7 trading, instant settlement, and self custody. Robinhood can make “all sorts of assets” accessible for users that weren’t feasible before, he said. Robinhood’s stock price has nearly tripled this year, rising 179% year-to-date to $104 on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. Despite a cooldown in crypto trading revenue, the firm posted stronger-than-expected sales and profits in the second quarter. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. Now, with the SEC committed to advancing tokenization frameworks under a crypto-friendly White House, Robinhood is positioning itself as a major player in the space, and one that could potentially benefit from the same regulatory tailwinds as crypto-native firms for years to come. Asked by an analyst for feedback that Robinhood is getting on tokenizing private assets, Tenev said that it’s addressed a mainstream criticism toward digital assets, namely the claim that they’re not tied to anything with "fundamental utility” and are ephemeral like memes. Aside from customers’ apparent demand for stock tokens, Tenev said the product's rollout demonstrated “the power of crypto technology and show[ed] a roadmap to what Robinhood could be if it was rebuilt from the ground up on crypto rails.” But not everyone was satisfied with Robinhood’s stock tokens, including OpenAI, which slammed the product as an unauthorized attempt to tokenize its equity. Not long after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned firms that their tokenized offerings must comply with securities laws, and a blockchain isn’t a valid way of getting around that. Tenev told Decrypt last week that he thinks the regulator’s warning was not specific to Robinhood, and on Wednesday, he noted that “some things need to happen” regulatory-wise to unlock tokenization’s true potential, including a look at investor accreditation laws. At the end of the day, Robinhood said that it’s still in the first phase of its tokenization strategy, which involves creating a sustainable supply of stock tokens. The second phase will involve getting the tokens to trade on Bitstamp, a crypto exchange that Robinhood acquired this year. Phase three, Tenev said, will allow users to plug stock tokens into decentralized finance, or DeFi protocols. DeFi applications allow users to self-custody their assets and transact natively on blockchain networks. “We have the technical capabilities to do all of this,” he said. “It's just a question of going through the regulatory process, and we think that's basically the optimal path.” Robinhood did not immediately respond to Decrypt.

Title: Circle: The Digital Dollar’s Unlikely King

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. The Infrastructure Powerhouse Built on Regulation, Compliance, and Transparency. Why the Real Battle Is Just Beginning The numbers told the story before anyone understood it. Circle's IPO wasn't just big; it was a spectacle. Priced at $35, the stock rocketed to nearly $300 within weeks, setting off a Wall Street frenzy. USDC, the world's second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, is used wherever value moves in crypto. It is embedded across protocols, blockchains, and DeFi platforms, and is becoming the connective layer between crypto and traditional finance. Circle stands as a rare asset in modern markets: a compliant, regulated, revenue-generating gateway to a financial system being rewritten in real time. Beneath the euphoria lies a paradox: Circle earns less from USDC than the partners helping distribute it. In 2024, Coinbase received $908 million, about 54 percent of Circle's total revenue. Circle retained the remaining 46 percent. That imbalance, as one-sided as it now seems, may have been the necessary price of market share. The revenue-sharing agreements weren't a misstep. They were Circle's way in: the cost of catching up, the price of market share. Circle launched USDC in 2018, entering a market where Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, already had a four-year lead and dominated liquidity, adoption, and trading pairs across exchanges. Tether operated under an offshore model and looser compliance standards. Coming from behind, Circle played a different game, turning regulation into a competitive edge and transparency into a trust-building tool for regulators and institutions. The results validated the approach: between 2018 and 2021, USDC's supply surged more than 8,300 percent, nearly doubling Tether's growth over the same period. But there's a deeper risk: its revenue model, anchored in interest income, could unravel if rates come down materially. So why are stablecoins such a big deal? In the first half of 2025 alone, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions. They're used in 89 percent of digital asset trades, power nearly half the liquidity in DeFi protocols managing over $200 billion, and now account for 15 percent of global retail cross-border payments. When someone buys Bitcoin on Coinbase, they're trading stablecoins, not dollars. Stablecoins slash cross-border payment costs by as much as 80 percent compared to traditional bank wires. Across Argentina, Vietnam, Turkey, and Nigeria, millions are turning to USDC for everything from groceries to rent, according to Chainalysis, which ranked these countries among the top five globally for grassroots crypto adoption in 2024. As stablecoins move into the mainstream, Circle's USDC is emerging as the default bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain economy. It's more than digital cash; it's an infrastructure layer for instant, 24/7 financial settlement. USDC spans 23 blockchains, is accepted by 89 percent of major exchanges, and reaches 500 million users across more than 180 countries through wallets and apps. In 2024 alone, its circulation jumped 78 percent to $64 billion, capturing a quarter of the global stablecoin market. Since launch, it has processed over $20 trillion in transactions, bridged $850 billion between crypto and traditional finance, and moved $20 billion through Circle's Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol. More importantly, USDC has proven its resilience under extreme stress. It survived the 2021–22 crypto winter when multiple stablecoins collapsed, maintained its peg during the Silicon Valley Bank crisis that threatened its reserve backing, and continued operating seamlessly while competitors faced regulatory scrutiny. Jamie Dimon, Wall Street's most influential banking CEO and longtime crypto skeptic, publicly acknowledged stablecoins in JPMorgan's Q2 earnings call: "We're going to be involved in both JPMorgan Depositcoin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it… The way to be cognizant is to be involved." And no stablecoin is more institutionally aligned than USDC. Circle's compliance-first strategy looks less like a hedge and more like a masterstroke. Circle's business model is deceptively simple. It earns interest on the dollars backing every USDC in circulation. With more than $60 billion worth of tokens issued, Circle holds an equal amount in reserves. About 85 percent of those reserves sit in a BlackRock-managed money market fund earning around 4 percent annually; the rest is held in cash at major banks. That interest income makes up the bulk of Circle's revenue. But the company doesn't get to keep most of it. To grow USDC's footprint, Circle signed revenue-sharing agreements with major crypto exchanges. These deals gave its partners a share of reserve income to promote and integrate USDC. The most favorable terms went to Coinbase: USDC's co-creator and largest distributor. Under the agreement, Coinbase keeps 100 percent of the interest on USDC held on its platform, which typically totals tens of billions of dollars, plus 50 percent of net reserve income from all other USDC in circulation after other partners take their share. The deal auto-renews through 2026 and could extend to 2029 if usage milestones are hit. In 2024, Coinbase earned more from USDC than Circle did. These terms made sense when market penetration was the goal—but now they leave Circle boxed in. Binance and Bybit also negotiated their own revenue-sharing deals, each securing a mid-to-high single-digit percentage of reserve income. While these cuts are smaller than Coinbase's, they still reduce Circle's overall take. In total, Circle retains only about 40 to 50 percent of net reserve income, all while bearing the full operational, compliance, and regulatory burden. And with interest rates expected to decline, the overall revenue pool is likely to shrink, tightening the squeeze just as Circle tries to scale into public markets. Circle isn't standing still. It's building new revenue streams that leverage its infrastructure: transaction fees, blockchain partnerships, and financial products with 100 percent gross margins. Blockchain partnerships monetize USDC's presence across networks. As new blockchains compete for users, hosting USDC brings instant legitimacy. Circle selectively charges integration fees for premium partners, turning network expansion into revenue. One of Circle's most effective pivots is charging fees for moving USDC between different blockchain networks. Think of it like a toll for crossing bridges between digital financial systems. Once offered for free, Circle now charges roughly 0.03 percent per transfer. With $20 billion in flows, it's become one of their fastest-growing income sources. Circle is also expanding into higher-margin financial products. Its acquisition of USYC, a digital money market fund, generates steady fee income from institutional exposure to government securities. Unlike USDC, these products carry no revenue splits. While these new revenue streams are gaining traction, Circle's long-term play is far bolder: embed USDC deep into the foundation of global finance. General payments represent a $240 trillion market where USDC's instant settlement could eliminate days-long delays and costly intermediaries. Circle envisions USDC becoming the digital backbone for everyday commerce, capturing a share of transaction fees from a market far larger than crypto trading. Cross-border payments offer the clearest near-term opportunity. Traditional wire transfers can take days, incur high fees, and pass through multiple correspondent banks. USDC can settle these transfers instantly and reduce costs by up to 80 percent. Circle's Cross-Border Payments Network is in early development, but partnerships with incumbents like FIS suggest a serious push into this space. Most ambitiously, Circle is partnering with ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, to pilot the use of USDC as collateral and settlement infrastructure for traditional financial instruments. If successful, this could dramatically accelerate settlement times, lower capital requirements for traders, and enhance market efficiency, positioning Circle to earn fees on trillions in global equity, bond, and derivatives transactions. These early initiatives show how Circle could turn its compliance-driven infrastructure into a scalable, high-margin business. Then came the regulatory watershed moment. In July 2025, the GENIUS Act swept through Congress, mandating full reserves and strict licensing for all stablecoins. Competitors scrambled to comply. Circle? It was already there—with monthly attestations, money transmitter licenses in 46 U.S. states, and years of regulatory groundwork. Overnight, its compliance burden became everyone else's nightmare—and Circle's competitive moat. Anyone can issue a stablecoin, but building trust, liquidity, and ubiquity takes years. Circle didn't just launch a token; it built the infrastructure everyone else now relies on. PayPal's PYUSD highlights the limits of closed ecosystems. Despite a massive user base, adoption has lagged due to limited utility outside its own platform. In contrast, adoption by Standard Chartered, Stripe, FIS, Visa, Mastercard, and even BlackRock reflects Circle's growing momentum. Near-zero interest rates would devastate Circle's revenue model, cutting reserve income while it surrenders 60 percent to partners. Regulatory winds could shift: a new administration might view private stablecoins as threatening dollar supremacy, or the Fed could launch its own digital currency. Most critically, if traditional finance adoption stalls, Circle's vision of embedding into global finance could remain just that: a vision. Without massive scale in traditional markets, its new revenue streams would stay subscale, leaving Circle dependent on a reserve interest model where it keeps the minority share. Now Circle is chasing the final piece of institutional legitimacy: a U.S. banking license. Its application for an FDIC charter is more than a regulatory formality; it's a strategic move to embed itself within the financial system. If approved, Circle would gain direct access to Fed payment rails, the ability to offer traditional banking services, and the trust halo of being a federally supervised institution. More importantly, it could position USDC as the safest digital dollar in circulation: government-regulated, fully reserved, and interoperable, without being state-controlled. In many ways, Circle functions like the Fed's unpaid R&D lab. Each USDC transaction is a real-time experiment in how programmable dollars might move through a modern financial system. Rather than launch a controversial FedCoin, regulators may opt to shape USDC, controlling the plumbing without owning the faucet. The application process won't be easy. Most crypto banking efforts have struggled to cross the finish line, and approval could take 18 to 24 months. But if Circle succeeds, it won't just sit on top of the financial system; it will become part of it. Circle's punishing revenue splits may reflect the cost of building foundational infrastructure. But if it executes on its trillion-dollar vision, those trade-offs could become footnotes to a much bigger success story. With regulatory tailwinds, monetization levers, and a banking charter in play, Circle is positioning for its next act. As CEO Jeremy Allaire put it, "we're still in the very early, early days of this," with stablecoins poised to scale into the trillions in circulation. The question isn't whether programmable dollars will reshape finance, but whether Circle will control the rails when they do. For investors, it's not just a fintech bet; it's a wager on who defines the future of money.

Title: Ripple CTO Explains Why XRP Ledger Lags Despite 300+ Bank Deals
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-ledger-lags-300-bank-deals/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T17:00:27Z
Full Content:
Ripple chief technology officer David “JoelKatz” Schwartz moved to explain the gap between Ripple’s oft-touted roster of bank relationships and the still-modest on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), responding at length on July 30 to a widely shared thread of questions from investor and YouTuber Andrei Jikh. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz pointed to compliance realities, institutional behavior, and product roadmap items—most notably a forthcoming “permissioned domains” model—as key reasons that institutional flows remain largely off-chain today. Jikh’s prompt captured long-standing critiques: after more than a decade and “300+ bank partnerships,” why isn’t the XRPL clearing “billions in daily on-chain volume,” why would payers choose a volatile asset like XRP over stablecoins, and—in a world saturated with fiat-linked tokens—do bridge assets still matter? He also raised questions about tokenization strategy, including why a firm such as BlackRock would select XRPL rather than operate a captive chain, and about geopolitical risk for non-US users. Schwartz’s central explanation for sluggish on-chain settlement was blunt about the constraints facing regulated entities that cannot unknowingly transact against illicit counterparties on public DEX liquidity: “Even Ripple can’t use the XRPL DEX for payments yet because we can’t be sure a terrorist won’t provide the liquidity for payment. Features like permissioned domains will address this.” The post acknowledged “it has been very slow” to shift institutional flows on chain, even as he argued that institutions are “starting to see the benefits.” Pressed by another user on whether the same counterparty-risk problem exists on other L1s, Schwartz said that, depending on how features are used, “generally decentralized exchanges on public layer 1’s don’t give you any control or knowledge of who your counterparties are.” The point was procedural rather than moral—“regulations aren’t always totally logical,” he added—underscoring why regulated payment flows have struggled to route through open liquidity. Schwartz framed “permissioned domains” as a design intended to keep the ledger’s openness while giving compliance-bound participants a venue with rule-enforced counterparties. In follow-ups, he described a structure in which “retail is welcome in the permissioned parts provided they can prove they’re not sanctioned,” and said the “net effect” should be that liquidity in these domains remains comparable to the open side because of market-making between the two. On the stablecoin question, Schwartz rejected the idea that XRP’s volatility automatically disqualifies it for payments. He argued there are use cases where volatility “isn’t a minus, or is even a plus,” and—separately—contended that a functioning bridge requires inventory: “A bridge currency only works if someone is holding it so that you can get it precisely when you need it.” He added that if users don’t know which asset they will need next, they may rationally hold the “dominant bridge” because it’s cheaper to pivot from a liquid hub asset into whatever comes next. Schwartz also addressed whether bridge assets still matter if stablecoins increasingly cover most trading pairs. He allowed that “if one stablecoin wins,” it could act as the bridge, but said he doesn’t think a single stablecoin can win because each is “only…stable relative to one particular fiat currency” and anchored to jurisdictions. That multi-stablecoin reality, he argued, leaves room for a neutral bridge to connect a “long tail” of tokenized assets. Asked why a heavyweight like BlackRock wouldn’t simply build its own chain for tokenization—especially as some brokerages do—Schwartz downplayed the importance of chain homogeneity in a world of interoperability and portability. He urged skeptics to “ask the same question about Circle—why don’t they launch USDC only on their own blockchain?” implying the obvious answer: ubiquity and liquidity come from meeting users where they are, across many networks. On geopolitics, he drew a line between XRPL, which he described as neutral infrastructure, and Ripple’s enterprise products, which are segmented by jurisdiction. “If you’re asking about XRPL, it’s not really US based,” he wrote, adding that the ledger “has never discriminated against any particular participant,” and conceding that, for Ripple’s own products, licensing realities apply and some corridors—“North Korea or Cuba any time soon”—are out of bounds. Schwartz further argued that XRP’s role within Ripple’s payments stack remains material even if much of it is not visible on public ledgers. “I don’t have the numbers in front of me,” he wrote, “but I’m pretty sure XRP’s use as a bridge in Ripple Payments dwarfs every other asset.” In a related point on XRPL design, he reminded readers that “XRP has a privileged place on the XRP Ledger.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.13.

Title: Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s new investor dominance is gaining momentum just as the asset consolidates in a tight range, setting the stage for a major breakout. After more than two weeks of sideways movement between $115,000 and $120,000, BTC continues to trade within this well-defined range—building pressure that typically precedes a sharp move. Data from CryptoQuant highlights a crucial dynamic: the comparison between demand and supply from new versus old investors. The current new investor dominance sits at 30%, only half of the “overheated” range of 60–70% seen during euphoric phases, but the trend is clearly climbing. This means new liquidity is entering the market steadily, while old holders are still distributing at a manageable pace. The supply of long-term holders is absorbing this growing young demand without disrupting the price structure. This healthy balance suggests that the market is still in a stable late bull phase, with no signs of mass profit-taking or capitulation from seasoned investors. With Bitcoin maintaining a bullish structure and demand from fresh entrants rising, the coming days will be critical. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared detailed insights into Bitcoin’s market structure, focusing on the balance between new and old investor behavior. According to Adler, previous peaks in new investor dominance—64% in March 2024 and 72% in December 2024—aligned precisely with local BTC price tops. At those points, new liquidity began to wane, and experienced holders ramped up profit-taking. Currently, new investor dominance stands at 30%, which is still far from those overheated extremes. However, the trend is upward. The purple fill on the chart, which reflects cumulative activity from younger coins, has been climbing steadily since July 2024. This indicates that a fresh wave of buyers continues to enter the market, while selling pressure from old hands remains limited. This dynamic creates room for further bullish continuation before the typical euphoria zone—above 60–70% dominance—takes hold. Old holders are still distributing coins, but only moderately. A coefficient of 0.3 means that three-year-old coins are absorbing demand without triggering major volatility. This balance suggests that the market remains structurally sound. Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,413, consolidating in a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as seen in the 8-hour chart. This sideways movement has persisted for over two weeks, indicating indecision in the market. The key support sits at $115,724, which has been tested multiple times but held firmly, while the $122,077 level acts as immediate resistance after a strong rejection earlier in July. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages, which now align in bullish order—another sign that the underlying trend is still intact despite short-term consolidation. Volume remains relatively low, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears are aggressively positioning at the moment. However, such tight ranges often precede large directional moves. If bulls manage to break above the $122K resistance with strong volume, it could trigger a continuation toward new highs. On the other hand, a breakdown below the $115.7K support would expose downside risk. Potentially leading to a retest of the 100-period moving average around $114,490 or even the 200-period average near $110,188.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Michael McDonald, Shirley Zhao and Filipe Pacheco Jul 30, 2025, (Bloomberg) –Panama’s comptroller general asked its Supreme Court to review the government’s contract extension with CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s local ports unit, potentially throwing a new wrench into the conglomerate’s controversial deal to sell its global terminals business. Panamanian official Anel Flores said he asked the court to find unconstitutional a 2021 extension for Panama Ports Co.’s contract to operate two ports along the Panama Canal and declare it null and void. “The contract was bad, one-sided and abusive, against the interests of the country,” he told a briefing in Panama City, adding that the ports belong to the country and should not be negotiated over by others. Panama Ports and CK Hutchison didn’t respond to requests for comment. The development risks further complicating a transaction that’s become a high-profile tussle between the US and China. CK Hutchison shares fell 2.2% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, dropping the most in over a month. “Panama’s legal challenge to CK Hutchison’s port concession could introduce material uncertainty and elevates the risk of delays, potentially derailing the deal or triggering a renegotiation at a lower valuation,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong said. The Panama terminals are at the center of the geopolitically delicate deal for the 43 ports owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison. A buyer consortium backed by BlackRock Inc. is seeking to acquire the business, with the American asset manager taking control of Panama Ports. “What is Panama’s business is that the ports are ours, they belong to the republic of Panama,” Flores told the briefing. “I don’t think it’s right that, at other latitudes, other people are negotiating the future using property that belongs to Panama.” Read More: How Li Ka-shing Landed in the Middle of US-China Tiff: QuickTake Still, some analysts assessed that Panama’s objection would not be a major roadblock for CK Hutchison’s deal, given that other ports in the country are operated by foreign entities. The development “appears a small-ish road bump to completing the global terminal deal,” said David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors. “There are three remaining Panamanian ports, all operated by foreigners, none of which has raised the ire of the comptroller,” he said, “implying there exist benchmark contracts that can be struck for these two ports.” Flores said in April that an audit by his office found that Panama Ports had failed to get proper approvals for its contract extension. Tax breaks under the contract have also cost the Central American nation $1.3 billion, as a series of tax-exempt shell companies operating on Panama Ports’s grounds helped the firm lower the share of profits it paid the government, he told a press conference at the time. Outside of Panama, CK Hutchison and the buyer consortium have been trying to find a solution for the transaction to move forward. While the deal has been hailed by US President Donald Trump as returning the canal to American influence, it’s been furiously opposed by Beijing, which considers BlackRock a proxy for American influence. China has also separately cautioned that antitrust reviews shouldn’t be bypassed, so as to prevent an agreement from being rushed into. “The complexity shows exactly how ports have become assets with larger geopolitical risks and why CK Hutchison wants to reduce its related business,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. CK Hutchison said this week that it may invite an unnamed “major strategic investor” from China to join the consortium, a move that’s aimed at appeasing China. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. has been negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the group, Bloomberg News reported. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Whale Buys $153M In Ethereum From Galaxy Digital OTC: Institutions Are Betting Big

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is once again approaching critical levels after a stretch of volatile yet bullish price action. Following a sharp rebound from yesterday’s low of around $3,675, ETH is now trading above the $3,800 mark, regaining momentum as traders eye a decisive move. While short-term volatility remains, the overall structure favors continuation—provided ETH can break cleanly above the $4,000 resistance level. This threshold now stands as the key barrier between consolidation and a potential rally toward new highs. A confirmed breakout would likely ignite fresh bullish momentum across the broader altcoin market. Until then, price remains trapped in a narrowing range, testing both trader patience and liquidity depth. Meanwhile, on-chain data supports the bullish case. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, whales have ramped up their accumulation, with large addresses steadily adding to their ETH holdings in recent days. This ongoing accumulation trend reflects growing conviction among high-cap players and adds weight to the possibility of further upside in the months ahead. Ethereum’s bullish narrative gained further momentum this week after Arkham disclosed a massive on-chain transaction involving a major institutional player. A fresh wallet address—0xdf0A67Ded855F8ea4baB6399690883243c0e2EF3—just received $153 million worth of ETH, purchased directly through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The scale and nature of this transaction suggest growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This isn’t just another whale move. The fact that the ETH was funneled into a new wallet from a regulated OTC provider underscores the strategic accumulation taking place behind the scenes. As traditional finance increasingly integrates with crypto, Ethereum’s utility, programmability, and future role in tokenized finance are making it a high-conviction play among institutional allocators. This heavy buy comes after a prolonged period of weakness. Earlier this year, ETH suffered persistent selling pressure, with price action sliding lower for months. Retail interest faded, and sentiment turned bearish. But while the public panicked, sophisticated players appear to have taken the other side of the trade—accumulating quietly during the downturn. Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade in a tight range just below the key resistance level of $3,860.80, as shown in the 4-hour chart. Despite recent price volatility, ETH has remained above its 50- and 100-period moving averages, currently near $3,756 and $3,629, respectively. This suggests that bullish momentum is still intact in the short term. Volume has picked up slightly, indicating rising interest from traders as ETH tests this critical horizontal resistance. The price has failed to close decisively above this level multiple times since July 25, highlighting its significance. However, the consistent higher lows forming over the past week point to building buying pressure beneath the surface. A confirmed breakout above $3,860.80 could open the door for a push toward the psychological $4,000 level and beyond. Conversely, failure to break resistance may lead to another retest of the 100-period moving average or even the $3,700 support zone.

Title: How to invest like you’re uber rich (even if you’re not!) (Paul Quickenden)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/29028/how-to-invest-like-youre-uber-rich-even-if-youre-not
Time Published: 2025-07-31T12:22:55Z
Full Content:
Let’s be honest - ‘Invest like the uber rich’ sounds like classic headliner clickbait. But here’s the thing… in a tokenised world, that headline is actually starting to hold up because the old barriers to high-value, long-horizon investing are crumbling fast and blockchain is the earthquake shaking the establishment's foundations. There’s always been a bit of mystery around how the global elite build and then keep their wealth. According to recent research reported on by Newsroom, the pattern is actually quite simple, i.e. “a distinctive focus on long-term thinking and alternative assets…” We’re not talking about chasing IPOs or crypto hype cycles here. This is intergenerational capital thinking around assets that hold value over decades and ignoring short-term volatility in favour of upside over time. Traditionally, that’s meant real estate, private equity and infrastructure - assets that are expensive to access and tough to liquidate. But all that’s changing… Fig 1: Multiple sources are now saying that high net worth individuals are getting into alternative investments in a proportional, long term manner (source): Crypto might not seem like a traditional ‘family office’ asset, but it ticks both boxes rich families are drawn to. It's alternative and when viewed through a long-term lens - its reward profile gets interesting. Volatility is still a part of the crypto story, but we’re seeing it flatten as the asset class matures - the highs aren’t quite as high and the crashes are not quite as deep. What’s more, as more infrastructure is built and more institutional capital enters, the swings are becoming less violent. That doesn’t mean crypto is risk-free - nothing is - but it is becoming something far more compelling: an alternative investment class with global reach, deepening liquidity and strong long-term upside for those with patience and a defined strategy. In that sense, it’s already mirroring the kind of thinking that the uber wealthy have leaned on for decades. Traditionally, the kinds of assets favoured by ultra-wealthy investors have been large, expensive and illiquid. Think commercial real estate, infrastructure projects, private equity and even fine art. These aren’t investments you can casually buy into with a few thousand dollars and even when you could, they usually come with long lock-up periods and little flexibility to exit. Enter tokenisation and it’s a genuine game changer… Tokenisation changes that by using blockchain technology to break these big-ticket assets into smaller, digital units - or fractionalising into ‘tokens’ - that can be bought and sold individually. It’s a bit like owning shares in a company, but instead, you own a fractional slice of a building, a venture fund or any other real-world asset. The key difference is that these tokens exist on a blockchain ledger, meaning ownership is secure, transparent and (potentially) tradeable 24/7. This is a big deal, because traditionally these types of assets have been the exclusive domain of the rich and powerful. A case in point is a tokenised villa in Dubai which sold in under 5 minutes (see here). Tokenisation enables everyday investors to own a slice of a premium commercial property without needing millions upfront, waiting decades to cash out or going through the typical real estate grind. This is the future of investing, and it looks a lot more inclusive than the past. And it’s not just real estate. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have both tokenised Money Market Funds, Goldman Sachs has issued a 2 year digital bond, while it is common to tokenise gold and carbon credits. Fig 2: A deep dive into the benefits of tokenisation. Benefits Description Example Faster Transaction Settlement Tokenisation enables near-instant, 24/7 settlement instead of traditional 2 or more days Goldman Sachs issued a €100M digital bond with same-day settlement (T+0) using blockchain Increased Liquidity By fractionalising traditionally illiquid assets, tokenisation opens markets to more investors and enables easier trading. Tokenising private equity or bonds lets investors buy small shares, bringing in more liquidity and opening up market access Operational Efficiency & Cost Savings Embedded smart contracts enable automatic execution of payments, compliance, and other conditions, enabling new business models. Automating interest calculations in tokenised corporate bonds streamlines servicing and compliance.Smart contracts for carbon credit tokens automate trading with transparent, enforceable rules Enhanced Security & Transparency Immutable blockchain ledgers provide auditable, tamper-proof ownership records; tokenisation also replaces sensitive data with secure tokens. JPMorgan’s JPM Coin improves payment security and settlement transparency on a permissioned blockchain Democratisation of Access Lower minimum investments and seamless global participation bring asset classes traditionally reserved for elites to wider audiences. Fractional tokens allow smaller investors to access high-value assets like art, real estate, and private funds Global Reach & 24/7 Markets Tokenised assets can be traded cross-border, anytime, breaking time zones and geographic barriers inherent in traditional finance. Swiss Digital Exchange supports tokenised securities trading round-the-clock with global investor participation Tokenisation is more than just a trend; it’s a fundamental shift in financial infrastructure. By enabling fractional ownership and recording it on-chain, tokenised assets bring transparency and auditability to markets that were once closed off to all but the wealthiest. They also inject liquidity into asset classes that have traditionally been locked up for years. Together with blockchain rails and crypto-based value transfer, this technology is building a new model of wealth creation - one that doesn’t care how big your starting balance is, only that you’re ready to play the long game.

Title: Miami Showband massacre 50 years on: ‘The trauma lasts for ever’ – Stephen Travers
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/2025/07/31/miami-showband-massacre-50-years-on-the-trauma-lasts-for-ever-stephen-travers/
Time Published: 2025-07-31T11:35:41Z
Full Content:
The Miami Showband’s days were numbered. The band had formed in 1962, playing its first gig in Portmarnock, at the Palm Beach Hotel, which inspired the group’s original name, the Miami Showband. Thirteen years, seven Irish chart-topping singles and several line-up changes later, lead singer Fran O’Toole and guitarist Tony Geraghty had both asked bass player Stephen Travers, who had only joined the band two months earlier, if he would like to play in their separate musical projects. In the meantime it was business as usual. After big gigs in Salthill, Co Galway, on Monday and Tuesday, the band met up at what is now the Regency Hotel near Dublin Airport and travelled north, over the Border, to play the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge on Wednesday, July 30th, 1975. A midweek gig in a midsized town was bread and butter for the Miami but a lifeline for locals who wanted to lose themselves in music and dancing and forget the Troubles. When the band reached Banbridge, Stephen and Fran, who had a sweet tooth, went to buy sweets. Stephen was unnerved when he saw skinheads running towards them, but one just wanted Fran’s autograph on his plaster cast. The band members never drank before a gig so they probably wouldn’t even have noticed the pub next door to the ballroom, much less been aware of its tragic Troubles story. The Signpost Inn had been owned by Jack McCabe, a past pupil of Dublin’s prestigious Blackrock College, who had abandoned a law career to take over the family business on the death of his father. On July 12th, 1972, he was shot dead in his other pub in Portadown. The gig didn’t start till after 11pm, so it was 2am by the time the band set off home. Stephen sat up front with his bandmate Brian McCoy, who was driving, while Fran, Des Lee and Tony Geraghty played cards in the back. At about 2.30am, halfway between Banbridge and Newry, the minibus was flagged down by an army patrol. The musicians were lined up outside and asked for their names and addresses. The roadblock was fake, however, although at least five of the soldiers there were serving or former UDR members. They were also loyalist paramilitaries. As two of them, Harris Boyle and Wesley Somerville, planted a bomb on the bus, it exploded prematurely, killing them instantly. The explosion blew the musicians into a field, where four were hunted down. Fran was shot 22 times, mostly in the face, Brian nine times and Tony four times. Stephen was hit; Des hid in the long grass, playing dead, and was not hurt. Stephen counted his fingers. As a musician, that was important. Next, he clicked his platform heels. He still had his legs. He was disorientated, however. “I didn’t know I was shot. I couldn’t figure out why my stomach was so distended. There was this terrible silence. The ditch was still on fire. I was crawling among the bodies, talking to them. I wouldn’t accept that they were dead. “I couldn’t stand up. I’d get up and fall down. For the hour or so I was there I was crawling around on my stomach. I found it difficult to breathe. I didn’t know that after the dumdum exploded inside me, part of it had travelled up after entering just above my right hip and went through my left lung which had collapsed. You often see someone after running a marathon sort of bending down and trying to get their breathing right. I tried that. I crawled over to the ditch and there was a low branch and I tried to lean over it, but no matter what I did I couldn’t get it right. I put it down to one of the soldiers having punched me in the kidneys.” James Blundell, the surgeon at Newry’s Daisy Hill Hospital who saved Stephen’s life, told him the anaesthetist had to compress his aorta to keep him alive until he received a blood transfusion. The Rev William McCrea, a Free Presbyterian minister and later a Democratic Unionist Party MP, conducted a UVF paramilitary funeral for Boyle and Somerville. (Decades later, he would also officiate at the funeral of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright.) [ ‘I was glad to see that it did come out that it was collusion’Opens in new window ] UDR sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell and lance corporal Thomas Raymond Crozier were convicted in 1976 of the murders. Imposing the longest life sentences in Northern Ireland history, the judge said he would have imposed the death penalty, had it not been recently abolished. Former UDR soldier John James Somerville, Wesley’s brother, was also convicted of the murders, in 1981. Stephen spent months recovering. The Miami reformed, having replaced Fran, Tony and Brian, but it felt macabre. “We became photo ops.” He left the following summer. As part of a criminal injuries case, Stephen had to see a psychiatrist. “He said, ‘I don’t like the way you’re handling this.’ I said, ‘Here’s the bottom line: I went to a gig, on the way home the lads were killed, I was shot, I survived, I’m fine.’ There was no such thing as counselling back then. Only sissies complained about their feelings.” The psychiatrist told him his response wasn’t normal. “He said, ‘I must warn you, in six months or 10 years the wall might fall on you.’” Stephen reflects with the benefit of hindsight and education. “I stepped back for 30 years, said I’m not going to talk or think about it, but that did awful damage.” He felt that as a musician in Ireland he could never escape his past, so he and his wife moved to London in 1983. One night he was having a drink in an Irish pub when the owner asked everyone for a business idea. Stephen saw a copy of The Irish Post and said that it needed competition. Within months, the Irish Advertiser was launched, with him as editor. The paper became The Irish in Britain News. Stephen cofounded another newspaper, The Irish World, in 1987. Three years later, I got my first job on The Irish World, moving to The Irish in Britain News, the two papers Stephen had helped to found, before spending nine years with The Irish Post, where Stephen wrote for me about music. I was in Harry’s Bar in Banbridge in the mid-1990s when a former Banbridge Academy classmate said loudly, “I hear you’re working for a Provo paper.” There is a certain type of unionist for whom anything Irish – be it the language, traditional music, the GAA or even a newspaper – is a republican front and a personal affront. Stephen and his family moved home in 1998. In 2000, he testified at Justice Henry Barron’s official inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Margaret Urwin, secretary of Justice for the Forgotten, a campaign group for its victims and survivors, told him that the Miami Showband massacre was not an isolated attack but one of many perpetrated by the Glenanne gang. In December 2011, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) report on the Miami killings raised “disturbing questions about collusive and corrupt behaviour”. It confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson’s involvement and linked him to RUC special branch. The report also revealed that on June 11th, 1975, more than a month prior to the killings, Jackson, his brother-in-law Samuel Fulton Neill and Thomas Crozier had been arrested for possessing four shotguns near Banbridge, but no charges were brought. Neill’s car was reportedly used in the Miami ambush, which took place just over a mile from Donaghmore, where Jackson grew up. Neill was shot dead in Portadown on January 25th, 1976, allegedly by Jackson for informing. Stephen said at the time, “We believe the only conclusion possible arising from the HET report is that one of the most prolific loyalist murderers of the conflict was an RUC special branch agent and was involved in the Miami Showband attack.” As he explained to me, “People said you now have the smoking gun of the culpability of the British State.” An independent international inquiry, chaired by Douglass Cassel of the Law School of the University of Notre Dame, concluded that there was “credible evidence that the principal perpetrator [of the Miami attack] was alleged RUC special branch agent Robin Jackson”. On May 19th, 1976, two of Jackson’s fingerprints were discovered on a silencer home-made for a Luger pistol. The silencer and Luger were found in a police raid on former B Special Ted Sinclair’s farm. The exhibit was mistakenly labelled, indicating that Jackson’s prints had been found on insulating tape wrapped around the silencer. Jackson, arrested on May 31st, denied having been at Sinclair’s farm but admitted knowing him through the Portadown Loyalist Club. When shown the Luger, silencer and magazine (but not the tape), Jackson denied having handled them. Asked to explain why his fingerprints might be on either pistol or silencer, Jackson said he had given Sinclair adhesive tape in the club. Although ballistic testing had linked the Luger (for which the silencer had been made) to the Miami attack, Jackson was never questioned about the killings, and the Miami inquiry team was never informed. Jackson claimed that one week before his arrest, two high-ranking RUC officers had told him his fingerprints had been found on the tape and that “I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for and there was no way out of it for me.” Despite a detective inspector’s recommendation, the officers faced no disciplinary action. Jackson was only prosecuted for possession of the silencer. The trial judge, Mr Justice Murray, acquitted him, saying, “I find that the accused somehow touched the silencer, but the Crown evidence has left me completely in the dark as to whether he did that wittingly or unwittingly, willingly or unwillingly.” Former RUC officer and convicted loyalist paramilitary John Weir told the Barron Inquiry that Jackson had co-ordinated the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Justice Barron concluded that Weir’s “evidence overall is credible”. Weir claimed Jackson had shot dead Catholic chemist William Strathearn in Ahoghill, Co Antrim, in 1977. Weir and RUC colleague Billy McCaughey were convicted of the murder but both named Jackson and another loyalist, RJ Kerr, as the killers. Jackson was never questioned for “reasons of operational strategy”, according to an RUC detective. Weir suggested that “Jackson was untouchable because he was an RUC special branch agent”. Weir had offered to testify against Jackson and Kerr if the murder charge against him was withdrawn. The prosecutor rejected this offer, saying that “Kerr and Jackson have not been interviewed by the police because the police state [that] they are virtually immune to interrogation and the common police consensus is that to arrest and interview either man is a waste of time. Both men are known to police to be very active and notorious UVF murderers.” Jackson was not unbreakable; he was untouchable. [ From the archive: Claim that hundreds of deaths in North happened due to collusionOpens in new window ] Mr Justice Barron was highly critical of the RUC. In 2006, a Dáil committee concluded that some loyalists, notably Robin Jackson, “were reliably said to have had relationships with British intelligence and/or RUC special branch and exchanges of information took place”. The Irish News reported in January 2020 that British ministry of defence documents linked SAS-trained undercover officer Captain Robert Nairac to the atrocity. Nairac was abducted and killed by the IRA in 1977 and his body has never been found. The papers were disclosed to solicitor Michael Flanigan, who represented Fran O’Toole’s widow, Valerie Andersen, in her legal action against the MoD and PSNI chief constable. It is understood the redacted documents contained suggestions that Nairac obtained equipment and uniforms for the killers. The file also claimed that he was responsible for planning and executing the attack. [ Who was Robert Nairac and what happened to him?Opens in new window ] A UVF handkerchief decorated with handstitched paramilitary figures and mottos was found among Nairac’s possessions. It is displayed in his regiment’s museum in London. The Miami victims’ families and survivors took a civil action against the police and the British ministry of defence. A settlement was only reached in December 2021, exactly 10 years after the HET report’s damning findings. They received £1.5 million to settle claims of collusion without any admission of liability. Stephen received the largest settlement, £425,000. “It’s all very well to say they settled without admission of liability, but they don’t pay you for annoying them. At the beginning they laughed at us, said we didn’t have a case. The PSNI and MoD put up every barrier, the three Ds: delay, deny and, ultimately, death.” That at least five UDR men were involved is only the tip of the iceberg for him. He dismisses the notion of rogue elements in the security forces and believes collusion was systemic. “Far more sinister people were involved. So-called experts concentrate on individuals but that is just very clever deflection. It was policy from the very top. Some of the bravest men I met were in the RUC. There was a point in the chain of command at which good reports just disappeared.” Almost 50 years have passed since the atrocity. How much of his life has he spent managing its repercussions? Should he prioritise his mental health over his feeling of responsibility to pursue justice? In 2005, Stephen’s friend Michael Gallagher, who lost his son Aiden in the 1998 Real IRA Omagh bombing, asked him to take part in an anti-radicalisation project at Warrington Peace Centre, set up in memory of two children, Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball, murdered by the IRA. He was asked to bring an object that related to his trauma. He brought Tony Geraghty’s guitar strings. He listened to a British soldier who had been abused as a child and suffered from alcoholism. “I felt I could help this man by telling him how I had coped, but I was in denial. When it came to my turn, I introduced myself, but when I went to take out the guitar strings, 30 years after the psychiatrist predicted it, the wall fell on me. I wasn’t in Warrington, I was in the field, I could hear all the screaming, the obscenities, the gunfire, the terror all around. “The soldier that I had been feeling sorry for had his arm around me and was telling me this is okay, it happens. This was the first time that I had shed a tear over the incident. I was ashamed that I had shown my feelings.” Stephen describes his post-traumatic stress thus: “It’s like when a TV producer is telling people which monitor to look at. For me it’s like there are two monitors. One is normality, which I’m focused on most of the time, but there is another big monitor and I’m drawn to that sometimes, and that is what happened on July 31st. When we went back on the road, sometimes I heard the fans screaming and thought it was something else.” When Stephen’s father served in the British army, he contracted malaria. It resurfaced from time to time over the years, just like Stephen’s trauma. [ Why I wrote Dirty Linen: recording the toll the Troubles took on my parish, the long tail of traumaOpens in new window ] “My father is the man I wish I could be,” Stephen says. “I once asked him what is the greatest achievement a person could have, and he said peace of mind. I didn’t understand then, but I understand now. “It helps you to manage it better, but it doesn’t ease it. No one back then ever mentioned PTSD. I’d never heard of enduring personality change. It was first used for people who had been in concentration camps. Having had that explained, I now know how difficult it was for me to fit into my old world but also how difficult it was for my wife to deal with me. “I have been in the incident for 47 years. It doesn’t happen that they take out the bullets and sew you up, and it is gone. The trauma lasts for ever.” Stephen helped set up a victims’ support group, the Truth and Reconciliation Platform. “I think the best way to speak up is to talk about your own experience. We wanted to get people from both communities to tell their stories. It has been a great education, but it came with a price.” Is it good for him, though? I am conscious of the irony. I am interviewing him about his trauma. “It’s essential,” he replies. “I certainly don’t have peace of mind but I would have less if I didn’t process the trauma by using it to help others. I think I’m stuck with that for the rest of my life and all I ever wanted to be was a bass player.” What good does it do? “An immense amount. I heard a woman on a radio show, coming back on the day after she spoke about her husband’s murder: ‘Yesterday I was nobody and my husband was nobody but today I am somebody and my husband is somebody.’” In 2005, to mark the 30th anniversary, Dana and Dickie Rock sang at an interdenominational service in Dublin’s Pro Cathedral. Brendan Bowyer headlined a memorial concert in Vicar Street. Another service was held in Portadown, with 15 marching bands, to commemorate two of the killers. In 2015, The Miami played their final gig at the Linenfields Festival in Lenaderg. The month before, 200 people had gathered at the ambush site to lay a wreath on the 40th anniversary. In Dublin, Stephen attended a ceremony at the memorial in Parnell Square. In 2019, Netflix released the Emmy-nominated documentary ReMastered: The Miami Showband Massacre. Yet in Banbridge, where Fran O’Toole, Brian McCoy and Tony Geraghty played just before they were murdered, there is nothing to acknowledge what happened. The Castle Ballroom is now a bingo hall. I am struck by the parallels between two of the UK’s most notorious serial killers in the 1970s. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, born in 1948, murdered 13 women and attempted to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980. Most of his victims were sex workers, whose low standing in the eyes of the public and particularly the police was believed to be a factor in the failure to apprehend the killer sooner. He was given 20 life sentences, converted in 2010 to a whole life order. He died in prison in 2020. Robin Jackson, the Jackal, was born two years before Sutcliffe, and his first murder was two years before Sutcliffe’s too. They were both HGV drivers, exploiting this to prey over a wide area. The low standing of Catholics in the North, particularly in the eyes of many in the British security forces, who perceived them as pawns in the war against the IRA, is the likeliest reason why he was never convicted of any of the 50 or so murders attributed to him. He died at his home in Donaghcloney in 1998. This is an extract from Dirty Linen: The Troubles in My Home Place by Martin Doyle, published by Merrion Press in 2023 and in paperback in 2024. The Bass Player: Surviving the Miami Showband Massacre by Stephen Travers will be published in September by New Island Books. The Miami Showband 50th Anniversary Memorial Concert takes place on Monday, September 29th, in Vicar Street, Dublin. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘Nothing Stops This Train’—Fed Dollar Crisis Predicted To Trigger ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Price Shock

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 07/31 update below. This post was originally published on July 30 Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, with the combined crypto market topping $4 trillion amid a Satoshi Nakamoto-era bombshell. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price, up almost double from this time last year, hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin earlier this month and is braced for an Elon Musk shock after his rocket company SpaceX set alarm bells ringing. Now, as traders bet on a new “infinite money glitch," legendary billionaire Ray Dalio has recommended a 15% bitcoin or gold portfolio allocation, warning the Federal Reserve has been caught up in debt “doom loop" and that the dollar is past the “point of no return.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are at the at the point of no return because we’ll be having more debt,” Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said on The Master Investor Podcast and calling the situation in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries a “doom loop.” "How do you pay all this debt and all this debt service plus everything else? The only way to do that is for the government to create debt and borrow that money to pay and the central bank printing the money." U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through Covid-era lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile. 07/30 update: The Federal Reserve has left interest rates on hold, as the market had expected it would do, though governor Christopher Waller and Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman voted for a cut, the largest number of dissenting votes by Fed officials in just over three decades. “If we cut rates too soon, maybe we didn’t finish the job with inflation. History is dotted with examples of that,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during a press conference. “If you cut too late, then maybe you’re doing unnecessary damage to the labor market.” Earlier, data showed the U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected pace in the second quarter as a growing trade balance and renewed consumer optimism propelled GDP to 3% for the three months from April through to the end of June. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed following the Fed’s interest rate decision, with one crypto company executive dismissing interest rate-led market swings as noise. “Institutions are in a race, for some it’s existential, for relevance in the next-gen financial internet,” Johnny Garcia, managing director of institutional growth and capital markets at VeChain, said in emailed comments, adding the "chatter and excitement around the direction of Fed rates is centrally focused on looking for buoy to send crypto prices higher–not about fundamental adoption.” Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have exploded onto Wall Street and into company’s treasuries in recent years, with companies led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sucking up around 2.5 million of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. “Nothing is stopping this train; least of all short-term one-off market-based factors such as the U.S. Federal funds rate," Garcia said. "When markets take into consideration the effect of central bank lending rates, it’s through the following perspective lens: current state and the direction of financial conditions and secondly expected economic activity as a result.” Tesla billionaire Elon Musk hit the campaign trail for U.S. president Donald Trump last year, issuing doomsday warnings over the spiraling U.S. debt pile and this year falling out with Trump over his failure to rein in spending. Musk called the dollar “hopeless" earlier this month, posting to his social media platform X that his new America Party would use bitcoin over so-called fiat currency. Dalio went on to advise investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold or bitcoin, going far beyond the 2% bitcoin allocation recommended by BlackRock, which has found phenomenal success with its $85 billion spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or bitcoin,” Dalio said, with his comments cheered by those in the bitcoin and crypto world. “The man has a point,” the X account of crypto asset manager Bitwise posted alongside a chart of U.S. debt shown soaring to around $35 trillion. “Dalio is merely suggesting putting a small portion of your deposit into time-tested assets, just like major funds do,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “15% of a portfolio is a rather small share—after all, the remaining 85% can be invested however you like. Both gold and bitcoin are considered safe-haven assets in times of high inflation. Gold needs no introduction as it’s a historically protected asset. And bitcoin is often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ especially given the way regulation is evolving and how banks and governments plan to use it." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious Meanwhile, bitcoin price and crypto analysts are predicting this is "critical" time for the market as investors increasingly pour cash into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Bitcoin could quickly reclaim $120,000 and push into price discovery,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. "The timing is critical. Spot bitcoin ETFs, and now ethereum ETFs, which have seen over $5 billion in flows in the past month and outpaced bitcoin on several days, continue to absorb institutional demand. With regulatory clarity taking shape and a coordinated federal stance now emerging, institutional adoption may accelerate meaningfully.” Mena added he believes the bitcoin price could soar be catapulted as high as $150,000 per bitcoin within the next couple of months if the Trump administration makes a “strong declaration around the strategic bitcoin reserve” Trump ordered the creation of in March.

Title: Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A task force established by President Donald Trump has issued a comprehensive crypto report advocating for clearer regulations governing digital asset markets. Released on Wednesday, the report calls on federal regulators to utilize their existing authority to create more definitive rules surrounding the trading of digital assets, thereby facilitating the adoption of innovative financial products. According to Bloomberg, the White House described the report as an essential step toward positioning the United States at the forefront of the blockchain revolution. “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can usher in the Golden Age of Crypto,” officials stated in a fact sheet accompanying the report from the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Formed through an executive order signed by Trump in January, the task force has proposed a variety of policy measures aimed at addressing the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Among its key recommendations is the urgent passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which seeks to eliminate regulatory gaps by granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority to oversee spot markets for non-security digital assets. The report also emphasizes the need to embrace decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies as a vital component of the evolving financial ecosystem. The report also urges both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to act swiftly, providing clarity on critical issues such as registration, custody, trading, and recordkeeping to enable federal-level trading of digital assets. These recommendations come on the heels of Trump’s recent signing of a congressional bill called the GENIUS Act, aimed at regulating stablecoins, marking a significant victory for the cryptocurrency industry. This new law establishes rules for US dollar-backed stablecoins, which proponents believe will pave the way for broader integration of digital assets into the financial system. The White House has indicated that additional details about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be forthcoming. This reserve is expected to consist of approximately 198,000 Bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal cases and other proceedings. An executive order issued earlier this year mandated that the Treasury Department retain these Bitcoin holdings, with directives to explore budget-neutral methods for acquiring more. The report also addresses other crucial issues, including the need for clarity on Bank Secrecy Act obligations to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) efforts. On tax policy, it recommends that Congress classify digital assets as a new category subjected to modified tax rules applicable to securities or commodities. Furthermore, it calls for legislation to extend wash sale rules to digital assets, preventing investors from claiming tax losses on securities if they repurchase similar assets within a designated timeframe.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. JPMorgan Chase and crypto exchange Coinbase have announced a new partnership on Wednesday that marks a pivotal shift in the relationship between traditional finance and digital assets. As the crypto industry experiences a bullish resurgence, fueled by a more favorable regulatory environment in the United States, major financial institutions are reassessing their earlier skepticism toward digital currencies and are now eager to explore the opportunities within this sector. The recent passage of key legislation—the GENIUS Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and anti-Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bills—through Congress has encouraged more banks and firms to consider integrating digital assets into their operations. This renewed interest comes at a time when the cryptocurrency market has reached an impressive valuation of approximately $4 trillion, with expectations for continued growth as regulatory clarity emerges in major markets. Starting in 2026, JPMorgan customers will be able to fund their Coinbase wallets using Chase credit cards, according to Reuters, therefore facilitating easier access to cryptocurrency purchases. The partnership also allows Chase customers to redeem credit card reward points for Circle’s USDC stablecoin. This feature, alongside the ability to link bank accounts directly to Coinbase for funding crypto purchases, reflects the increasing integration of digital assets into everyday financial transactions. Stablecoins, which are designed to minimize price volatility, are positioned as essential tools for facilitating seamless transactions in both trading and payments. They are now under a new regulatory framework established by the GENIUS Act, which was signed by President Donald Trump. Market analysts have noted that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is set to accelerate in light of the recent legislative changes. BCA Research highlighted that companies within the crypto ecosystem are well-positioned to benefit from this growth, suggesting that increased adoption will lead to price appreciation for digital assets. Coinbase’s stock, COIN, has responded positively to the partnership news, rising by 6% in Wednesday’s trading session, closing the day at $377 and reflecting a broader trend in the company’s performance. With shares up around 50% this year, Coinbase has achieved a market capitalization of approximately $95 billion, further solidifying its role as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Reuters highlighted that the crypto exchange’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index underscores its growing significance and acceptance in the mainstream financial world. Other financial institutions are also taking steps to engage with the crypto market. Earlier this month, PNC Bank announced its collaboration with Coinbase to offer cryptocurrency trading to its customers, indicating that the interest in digital assets is not limited to JPMorgan alone. Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America are among the largest US banks joining this growing trend, in which cryptocurrencies are expected to benefit tremendously.

Title: Chainlink Acknowledged By The White House As Key Player In Crypto Infrastructure

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The White House has officially recognized Chainlink (LINK) as an essential component of the digital asset ecosystem. This acknowledgment comes from the recently published Digital Asset Report, which emphasizes the importance of decentralized oracles in the functioning of stablecoins and tokenized assets. Market expert Quinten Francois highlighted this recognition on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), stating, “WHITE HOUSE JUST MENTIONED CHAINLINK.” The report underscores how oracles act as a bridge connecting external data sources to blockchain networks, enabling smart contracts to execute agreements based on real-world events and prices. This functionality is crucial for decentralized applications (dApps) that facilitate a range of financial activities, including trading, lending, and earning rewards. Chainlink’s role becomes even more vital in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), where dApps often serve as cross-chain bridges, allowing assets to move seamlessly between different blockchain networks. These wrapped assets, which exist on one chain but are represented on another, illustrate the growing complexity and interconnectivity of the blockchain ecosystem. Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink, responded positively to the White House’s endorsement, expressing his appreciation for the administration’s commitment to advancing the blockchain industry. Nazarov noted that Chainlink’s recognition represents a critical moment for both the industry and the broader US financial system. Chainlink’s co-founder further noted: I think the president’s (Trump) clear placing of our industry as a national priority will be seen as a critical and historic moment for our industry and for the United States financial system’s role globally. Nazarov distinguished the report’s focus on oracles, particularly the Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which according to his assessment highlights the innovative work being done by the Chainlink community to enhance smart contract capabilities. Beyond its focus on Chainlink, the White House report outlines various recommendations aimed at structuring cryptocurrency markets and clarifying the regulatory roles of federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). An earlier report by Bitcoinist also notes that the White House encourages Congress to implement laws that embrace decentralized finance technologies, recognizing their potential to reshape traditional finance. Despite the optimism surrounding these developments, some industry leaders had anticipated further details regarding a federal Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, a topic notably absent from the report. During a press briefing, a White House official mentioned that infrastructure for this initiative is currently being developed, with more information expected in the near future. Despite this development, Chainlink’s native token, LINK, remained unfazed, currently trading at $17.80. Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading 66% below its record high of $52.

Title: Tech giants face pushback from backers on scale of AI spending

‘If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass’ Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30. Photo: Getty Earnings season for a handful of megacap tech firms has morphed into capex season with the AI arms race showing no signs of slowing. Focus will be on how much the behemoths Microsoft and Meta Platforms plan to dish out to keep up with competitors like Alphabet and Amazon.com as they build out infrastructure and software to power artificial intelligence applications. The answer, estimated at around $70bn (€61bn) in each company’s current fiscal year, may matter more to investors than actual profits and will go a long way to determining whether blistering rallies in the shares will persist. ​ For nearly two years now, investors have continued to shower Big Tech with cash as the companies churned out lavish profits and then reinvested hundreds of billions of dollars into AI. Now, with Microsoft and Meta having notched rallies north of 40pc from April lows, analysts worry massive outlays without corresponding AI profits could dent investor enthusiasm. “If a company is saying, maybe we’ll see an AI benefit in five years, we’re no longer at the point where that will get a pass,” Gabriela Santos, chief strategist for the Americas at JPMorgan Asset Management, said in an interview. “Valuations are mattering more and more, and valuation especially matters if a company can’t grow sales as fast as expected, or as quickly as capex.” Microsoft is expected to report about $18bn in capital spending in the quarter ended June 30, an increase of nearly 30pc from a year ago. Sales at the software giant are forecast to rise 14pc. Meta, meanwhile, is expected to show $16.4bn in spending, double from the year-ago period, while revenue will rise 15pc, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Last week provided a hopeful marker for Big Tech bulls. Alphabet shares rose as the company boosted its capex forecast 13pc to $85bn after delivering better-than-expected earnings. A gain in the week erased what had been a loss in 2025. The bar is likely higher for Meta and Microsoft when it comes to spending, not least because their shares have rallied about 20pc this year versus Alphabet’s 3.4pc gain. They also have different approaches to AI than Alphabet’s search-driven focus, with Microsoft teaming with OpenAI and Meta trying to develop “super intelligence” with an army of engineers, lured with massive pay packages. Last quarter, AI spending proved somewhat beneficial. Meta’s strength was credited to AI improving ad targeting, and Microsoft saw a similar tailwind with its cloud business. “Microsoft is investing aggressively into AI, which looks like the right strategy if you have a long-term view on the stock,” Daniel Flax, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman, said. Santos struck a more cautious tone specifically on AI outlays. “We’re really honing in on margins this quarter,” she said. “It is still all about ROI, and what companies can grow their sales faster than what they’re invested into AI capex.” With capex swelling at both companies, neither can afford to falter in the businesses that have generated billions in cash flow in recent years – a misstep Flax thinks both can avoid. “Microsoft is executing extremely well on its cloud opportunity,” he said. Azure, the OpenAI investment, and AI assistant “Copilot” should ease worries about spending, said Krishna Chintalapalli, portfolio manager and tech sector head at Parnassus Investments. “Those are all huge and growing businesses, and Microsoft seems like it has less risk in its non-AI business, where there is steady recurring revenue,” he said. Meta’s AI bets also make sense to investors. It has “multiple ways to earn a return on AI spending,” according to Michael McKinnon, who manages more than $40bn as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners. He cited the ability to improve efficiency and increase both user engagement and the return on ad spend for its customers as ways for AI to drive growth, in addition to the ability to create new business categories, such as with its smart glasses. This is a “very different kind of spending than what we saw a couple years ago, when it was spending $20bn on Reality Labs,” which was a “low-probability bet that didn’t justify the level of investment Meta was throwing at it”. Still, with trillion-dollar valuations and P/E ratios near or above long-term averages, investors will likely remain cautious as the results roll in. Option-derived implied moves for the shares following the reports are relatively muted, with Microsoft at 3.9pc and Meta at 5.8pc. “Historically, high or rising capex is a negative factor, but the more profitable the company is, the more it turns into a positive factor,” said Tony DeSpirito, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Fundamental Equities. “That’s why these big tech companies are getting treated differently than another company might.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Letters: My plan to help fix the housing crisis is outside the box, but it’s worth a shot

We need radical ideas if the housing crisis is to be alleviated. Photo: Getty President Franklin D Roosevelt came up with a solution for the shortage of labour to build large projects when he ordered the construction of dams, highways and schools all over America. Workers flocked to these sites and were housed in temporary’ compounds beside each job. Based on army barracks, they were made of timber and were simple, warm and comfortable, with showers, kitchens and other basic essentials. They could be dismantled and the land returned to green grass. We should copy this to scale up our labour force for the construction of housing and other large projects. This is a national emergency and no time for nimbyism. We should build modular accomm­odation that could be moved to follow the work. We should place ads across eastern European countries seeking qualified tradesmen with 10 years’ experience to come and work in Ireland. We should offer them a two-year term at full hourly industry standard rates of pay. Each worker would pay full tax, but if he or she finishes the term they would get the full amount returned as a lump sum to send home to their family. As all pay rates are the same, each worker could follow the work from job to job as and when needed. Each compound would have a basic office where the weekly work could be booked. This would ensure a secure pool of expert labour available to all. Each man would get a free Ryanair flight home for one week each quarter to visit family, and Michael O’Leary should be asked for a contract rate. Mr O’Leary would answer the call. This is a brief snapshot of a concept I believe would help to solve our housing crisis. I know it’s out-of-the-box thinking, but given the scale of the crisis we face, I believe it’s worth a shot. Harry Crosbie, Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Scaffolding blocks our pavements. We are delayed and diverted on our roads. We are tormented by drilling and concrete saws. Our homes are covered in dust. There is a need for decent architecture and design. Don’t tell me there’s a shortage of builders. The place is walking with them. Eve Parnell, Dublin 2 It seemed hard to beat Donald Trump’s suggestion of a 1,000pc discount on drug prices as a maths error, but then his son stepped up. In reference to the new Trump golf course in Aberdeenshire, Eric Trump said it was wonderful because “we had an unlimited budget and we exceeded it”. Quite an achievement. This all sounds funny until you consider who is in charge of the US and its economy. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne Reading your editorial (‘New Garda chief must focus on strategic challenges’, July 30), I couldn’t help but feel there must be another key priority for the commissioner that is given scant attention. The men and women of An Garda Síochána need morale restored at all levels, and this goes way beyond rosters. It has taken a battering over recent years and is tied to a depleted force that has to do more with less. An internal appointment, Justin Kelly has the experience to potentially reset relations with all ranks of the force that could have a very positive effect. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo It is unconscionable that the humani­tarian tragedy in Gaza has reached the shocking levels we now see on a daily basis. The harrowing scenes of starving children, mere walking skeletons, will be a stain on our shared humanity. This is one of the darkest chapters of dehumanisation, demonisation and demoralisation in the annals of human history. Homes are in ruins, while the ­Palestinian people are starved and left distraught. Mothers are frightened and in disbelief. Children are left maimed and bloodied as Israel keeps up its relentless attacks on the innocents. Efforts in recent days to deliver aid to the besieged people in Gaza, provide medical support, facilitate medical evacuation and cater for the needs of the sick and injured are a drop in the ocean of need. A complete cessation of hostilities by ­Israel must happen, and an unimpeded flow of flood, fuel and medicine must be allowed in. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob, London We all know what Nero was doing as Rome burned, but now we see what Donald Trump occupies himself with as thousands of Gazan children starve in front of the world. Over the last few days, the US president has played two rounds of golf, cut a ribbon to add to his family property portfolio and still found time to ride roughshod over the EU with his tariffs. Did he give any time or thought to the starving population in Gaza? Donough O’Reilly, Stillorgan, Co Dublin Michael D Higgins should be congratulated on reminding his fellow European presidents of their moral duty to do their utmost to help end the genocide being carried out on the people of Gaza by Israel before the eyes of the world. J Anthony Gaughan, President Irish PEN, Blackrock, Co Dublin Pope Leo has urged young people to use AI for good and to “create encounters between hearts”. It is a refreshing break from the usual Vatican dread about algorithms and doom. He even posed for selfies. Frankly, it’s a miracle the man didn’t get ­auto-tagged as a lifestyle influencer. If Pope Leo keeps this up, he may soon be declared patron saint of wifi connections, “strong in spirit and signal”.

Business FILE PHOTO: The company logo of CK Hutchison Holdings is displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo PANAMA CITY :Panama's comptroller general, Anel Flores, said on Wednesday he had filed suit to the nation's Supreme Court against a contract to operate ports near the Panama Canal, held by a local firm controlled by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Flores said the two suits were to declare the unconstitutionality and to nullify the contract to operate the Balboa and Cristobal ports. The Supreme Court would still need to accept the request to hear the comptroller's complaint. The suits stem from a months-long audit spearheaded by Flores, who has publicly complained that the contract did not serve the nation's interests. Flores has not made the full audit public, but said on Wednesday that it had revealed "many irregularities."

A group of 26 financial officers from 21 states sent letters to 18 major financial institutions this week, warning them to abandon environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices if they wish to continue doing business with their states. The letters said ESG has undermined the traditional fiduciary duty that firms owe their clients, focusing solely on financial return, and instead prioritizes advancing political agendas. “Fiduciary duty has long been a critical safeguard that facilitated efficient capital allocation grounded in financial merit rather than political ideology,” the letter said. “But that clarity is being diluted under the banner of so-called ‘long-term risk mitigation,’ where speculative assumptions about the future, like climate change catastrophe, are used to justify ideological conclusions today.” Signers include state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers from states like Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Utah. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and 17 other financial leaders were recipients of the joint letter. Others include executives from Vanguard, Fidelity, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and State Street. The letter said that while some firms have started leaving global climate coalitions and reducing ESG-related proxy votes, the state financial officers want “durable assurances” that fiduciary duty, not politics, drives investment decisions. “While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.” The move comes after Texas removed BlackRock from its blacklist earlier this month and resumed investing with the firm – a move that drew criticism from others still pushing back against ESG. The letter indicates that many states won't follow suit. “Financial institutions wishing to compete for our states’ business should provide durable assurances that their practices align with these principles,” the letter said. “Our responsibility is to ensure public assets are managed in the best financial interest of beneficiaries and taxpayers.” O.J. Oleka, president of the State Financial Officers Foundation, said the states are right to demand proof that ESG is no longer a factor in investing for these companies. “Actions always speak louder than words. Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

I believe it was promoted by Dim leaning states and their treasurers that manage state pensions. Basically, ESG was a score for how much a firm wanted Dim run pensions to invest in those businesses.

Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team.

Requiring America's financial giants to prove their independence from woke ideology with concrete steps before doing business with a state's dollars is fully necessary and just makes sense,” Oleka said. “These financial officers are doing the right thing for their states and the taxpayers whose financial security they've been entrusted to protect.” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, also praised the letter. “BlackRock is playing a game of deceit,” Hild said. “Fink and his team are trying to say all the right things to conservatives while quietly doubling down on their activist agenda behind the scenes.” TOPICS: Business/Economy; Government; News/Current Events; Politics/Elections KEYWORDS: affirmativeaction; blackrock; climatechange; coal; dei; die; diversity; energy; esg; evs; fidelity; goldmansachs; jpmorgan; statestreet; vanguard; woke 1 posted on 07/30/2025 2:42:54 PM PDT by george76 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: george76 who wrote the rules for esg? how did it even become a thing? 2 posted on 07/30/2025 2:49:25 PM PDT by joshua c [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: george76 Pennsylvania treasurers>>> She is a good one.

I believe it was promoted by Dim leaning states and their treasurers that manage state pensions. Basically, ESG was a score for how much a firm wanted Dim run pensions to invest in those businesses. Pension money managers = big investors. Imagine a CEO trying to impress not just a Warren Buffet running one Berkshire Hathaway, but a room full of Buffets each running a different large investment "firm" (pension plan). That's how the ESG score was created and how it basically wound up being nothing but a score of how much a firm likes to kiss Dims' butts. Even Tesla's ESG sore dropped as soon as Musk started supporting Trump. Though absolutely nothing changed about Tesla's involvement in the E of ESG (environment). Tesla is still making EV's and cashing in on carbon credits and such that by Dim logic makes them more environmentally "green" than any other company. But various investment firms like Blackrock downgraded Tesla's ESG "score" and Dim run states moved their large pension investment plans out of Tesla stock -- all because Musk joined Trump's team. That's how phony the ESG bull crap is. 8 posted on 07/30/2025 4:00:27 PM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)
