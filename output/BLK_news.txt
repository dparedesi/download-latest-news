EditorEconomy Natural News, Willow Tohi In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRock’s exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bank’s purview. “Climate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,” Powell stated, reflecting the Fed’s reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fed’s exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRock’s departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europe’s energy crisis. The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UK’s climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decade—far exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology.

Title: 'Too much pessimism' — Fink, Trump and Schwarzman take aim at risk-averse Europe in Davos

The US economy is the toast of Davos, while Europe has been thrown to the wolves at the elite gathering in the Swiss Alps this week. World leaders, business titans, and policy gurus have hailed America's resilient growth, can-do culture, free-flowing capital, and bright prospects if President Trump succeeds in bolstering investment and cutting regulations. In contrast, they called out widespread pessimism, siloed markets, suffocating regulations, and an aversion to taking risks and shouting out successes in Europe. Here are some of the best comments from Davos about Europe: "They're very frustrated because of the time everything seems to take to get approved," Trump said about his European friends and acquaintances. "I love Europe, I love the countries of Europe, but the process is a very cumbersome one, and they do treat the United States of America very, very unfairly with the VAT taxes and all of the other taxes they impose." "There's too much pessimism in Europe," Fink said, based on his conversations with Davos attendees. "I've never felt the pessimism being larger and more profound." "Europe is a myth," he said, calling out its fragmented capital and banking markets, and its lack of dynamism and entrepreneurship relative to countries like the US and China. "I don't see Europe moving forward enough; I see Europe still focusing on backward looking too much." Lagarde said corporate bosses are "not very upbeat" about Europe as they're worried about issues including energy prices and excessive red tape. Their concerns should be a "wake-up call that we Europeans, those in policymaking places, have to really take to heart and respond fast to," she said. "So if the European leaders can actually get their act together, respond to this wake up call and existential threat that can be identified, then I think that there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call." Georgieva described the IMF's economic forecast for Europe over the next couple of years as "sort of meh, not great." "United States has a culture of confidence; Europe has a culture of modesty," Georgieva said. She joked the highest praise she ever received from her parents was "not too bad" while in the US, "you just move your legs and you're fantastic, you blink and you're great." "So my advice to my fellow Europeans is more confidence, believe in yourself, and most importantly tell others that you do." Ulbrich, whose company works in real estate and investment management, told Business Insider at Davos that European officials seemed prouder to announce regulations on artificial intelligence than to reveal big investments in the tech. He said that "demonstrates very nicely the difference in culture: The Americans are looking first to the opportunity, and the Europeans tend to look first toward the risk." "A lot of the European businesspeople have expressed enormous frustration with the regulatory regime in the EU," Schwarzman said, adding that they especially blame bureaucracy for slower growth rates in Europe. Kadri said that since she moved to Europe in 2019, there've been "19,000 pages of regulation published just for the chemical industry," and she's been "hiring more people in the legal and compliance departments than in my innovation department." The executive said that small and midsize businesses can't deal with the "soup of alphabet of reporting" requirements, and the bureaucratic burden is "destroying the fabric of the industry." Kadri called for a major simplification of the rules and removal of red tape to improve transparency and predictability, which she said would improve efficiency and drive investment. Jump to

Title: Texas Asks Wall Street Firms for Details About DEI Efforts

Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continueto focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. Topics Texas

Title: How the Fed’s latest decision could affect crypto markets in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-24T17:26:57Z

Bitcoin may have kicked off 2025 with a rebound back to $100,000, but since the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s December 2024 Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Jan. 8, the BTC/USD exchange rate dropped to as low as $91,220.84. Bitcoin has stabilized at around $95,000 since then, but concerns run high whether further news about the future direction of interest rates and monetary policy will result in an additional negative impact to the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrencies have entered the financial mainstream, they have become increasingly sensitive to policy changes from the Federal Reserve. With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at the latest news from the Fed, and see what it could mean for the performance of both Bitcoins and altcoins in the months ahead. As revealed in the aforementioned Fed meeting minutes, the central bank once again cut interest rates by 0.25%, or 25 basis points. This was in line with expectations. However, while the latest rate cuts arrived as expected, other takeaways from the meeting minutes caught investors off-guard. Namely, the Fed’s signaling of its plans to reduce the number of 25-basis point rate cuts in 2025. Before the meeting minutes hit the street, the market was still expecting four such cuts throughout the year. The latest remarks from Fed officials regarding quantitative tightening also suggested that the “Fed pivot” this year will not be as rapid of a shift from hawkish to dovish as previously anticipated. Taking this into account, it’s not completely surprising that Bitcoin has once again encountered negative volatility. Nor is it surprising that more volatile altcoins, like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, have all experienced double-digit declines over the past week. As “risk-on” assets, cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, perform better during times of accommodative fiscal policy. Yet while the Fed may be not turning as dovish as previously expected, and is in fact continuing to engage in monetary tightening, the impact of these policy decisions on cryptocurrency prices in 2025 may not be as dire as it seems at first glance. Although the cryptocurrency market reacted negatively to the Fed’s current policy gameplan, said plans could still result in further upside for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For one, the planned implementation of fewer 25 basis-point rates still means a further loosening of monetary policy, helping to justify additional upside for this “risk-on” asset class. Second, with regards to Bitcoin, other positive factors are at play that could drive further upside for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. These include increased institutional and retail investor allocation, as well as the specter of a more favorable crypto regulatory environment from the incoming Trump administration. Binance CEO Richard Teng commented on what we can expect in the crypto industry in 2025, “We expect to see development across all aspects. Crypto regulation saw great growth across the world in 2024 and we expect to see more in 2025. Given the recent U.S. presidential election and expected crypto regulation from its new government, we expect to see other countries follow the lead from the U.S. and enact more legislation across the world.” Teng continues, “In terms of institutional interest, financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto business in 2024, and we expect to see more new players next year. More companies are learning about crypto and integrating crypto features like tokenization into their business. This is a trend that has grown for years and we expect to see more development in.” Admittedly, the recently-announced changes to the Fed’s rate cut plans could still negatively impact the performance of altcoins in the short-term. Altcoins are much more sensitive to changes in fiscal policy. Nevertheless, if a bull market continues in Bitcoin, chances are it will spill over into the altcoin space as well. Investors profiting from a continued run up in the price of Bitcoin could cycle their gains into Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and other major and emerging altcoins. Over a longer timeframe, the Fed’s decision to more cautiously lower interest rates and loosen fiscal policy may do little to threaten the long-term bull case for cryptocurrencies. Due to a variety of trends, including the proliferation of exchange-traded cryptocurrency investment products, institutional and retail capital inflows into cryptocurrencies are poised to continue. Of course, nothing’s for certain. For instance, following the latest jobs report, there is growing doubt whether the Fed will further walk back its 2025 rate cut plans. Even if the Fed sticks to its current plan, this asset class is likely to stay highly volatile. Caution and patience remain key. Nevertheless, taking into account not just the Fed news,but the other positive trends at play as well, the opportunity for long-term price appreciation with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still on the table.

Title: Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) on Substack by Jacob Rowe. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ACHV. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV)'s share was trading at $3 as of Jan 23rd. Copyright: nedoba / 123RF Stock Photo Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV) presents a compelling investment opportunity, with its nicotine cessation drug, Cytisinicline, positioned to disrupt the market. The company has reached a significant milestone in its development, completing a six-month safety study involving 300 patients without any safety concerns, paving the way for an NDA submission in April/May. As Cytisinicline holds breakthrough designation, the likelihood of a priority review is high, particularly given its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to Chantix, the previous category leader now available as a generic. This positions Achieve for substantial upside potential, especially as the stock currently trades near 52-week lows despite being de-risked. Cytisinicline’s data from multiple Phase 3 trials underscores its efficacy, with odds ratios significantly outperforming Chantix. For example, while Chantix achieved an odds ratio of 2.88 over a 12-week trial, Cytisinicline demonstrated odds ratios between 5.0 and 6.3 in comparable trials, alongside fewer side effects. Its safety profile closely mirrors typical nicotine withdrawal symptoms, further solidifying its appeal. With an expected price point of $700–$800, Cytisinicline could capture a significant share of the $1 billion-plus nicotine cessation market. Even a conservative 30% market share implies $300 million in annual revenue, supporting a valuation of approximately $1 billion at 3x sales. A 60% share would push revenue to $600 million and valuation to $1.8 billion, representing a potential 5x–10x return for investors based on the current diluted share count. The timeline for additional catalysts is clear. Results from the ongoing one-year safety study, which involves 100 patients continuing from the initial cohort, are expected by mid-year, further de-risking the investment. Achieve’s strategic positioning, bolstered by its new investment banking board members and a cash runway through Q3 2025, increases the probability of a buyout in 2025. Moreover, priority review could lead to a PDUFA date in Q4 2024, potentially driving a sharp valuation rerating as biopharma funds recognize the mismatch between market price and intrinsic value. With its transformative potential and favorable risk/reward profile, Achieve Life Sciences stands as a strong candidate for multi-bagger returns. Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (ACHV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 6 hedge fund portfolios held ACHV at the end of the third quarter which was 7 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ACHV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ACHV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s Need to Know: Davos newsletter. To get updates on the World Economic Forum delivered straight to your inbox, sign up here. After a week dominated by President Donald Trump’s shadow and tariff tensions, Davos 2025 wrapped up with a subdued final day, giving the world’s elite a chance to catch their breath and focus on the broader picture. One of the final panels brought together the world’s top economic voices for a reality check. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pushed back against European pessimism, saying that “the economy is larger than any one political party.” European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde pointed to Europe’s “huge potential” in GDP, talent, and savings, urging leaders to “respond to this wake-up call and existential threat.” Both Lagarde and IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva emphasized AI’s crucial role in growth. “Make sure that artificial intelligence is not a privilege of few,” Georgieva urged. Lagarde said that AI’s potential is “huge,” but that it must “improve the state of the world, for all of us.” Georgieva also zeroed in on productivity as the key differentiator between U.S., European, and emerging market growth. Her prescription for lagging regions? “Capital has to have long legs and go where it makes the biggest difference,” she said, with a particular call for Europe to deepen its capital markets. All of these themes echoed through the week at the World Economic Forum: Europe’s challenges and potential, AI’s promise and perils, and the ever-present question of American influence. The gathering’s official theme, “Collaboration for the Intelligent Age,” took on new meaning with each passing day. Monday opened with European leaders defending democracy and climate action against Trump’s America First agenda. By midweek, his virtual appearance laid out a second-term vision from tariffs to his $500 billion “Stargate” AI project, while Meta’s moderation retreat and Spain’s call for digital ID requirements highlighted the growing rift over tech governance. NATO chief Mark Rutte surprised many by embracing Trump’s Russia stance, while WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala urged everyone to “chill” about tariffs. Even JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund chief agreed on one thing: Trump’s return was awakening Wall Street’s “animal spirits.” Through it all, one message remained clear: Whether it’s AI access, trade policy, or capital markets, the push-and-pull between cooperation and competition will define 2025 — Trump’s version of it, anyway.

Title: This week's meme coin mania sparked a wave of unauthorized tokens looking to cash in on the frenzy

Time Published: 2025-01-24T16:41:16Z
Full Content:
Trump's meme coin was the talk of the crypto market this week, and its success sparked a wave of unofficial tokens looking to woo investors with the promise of swift gains. The frenzy began shortly after Donald and Melania Trump launched their own meme tokens, $Trump and $Melania, the weekend before the inauguration. Those coins attracted a rush of retail money — much of it from first-time crypto buyers — as well as some big money "whales." As their prices went parabolic, it didn't take long for imitators to crop up, with issuers minting new tokens bearing the names of high-profile figures. A meme coin named after Ivanka Trump quickly climbed 275%, according to CoinMarketCap data, with the coin spiking the morning of the presidential inauguration. However, unlike the official Trump and Melania tokens, $Ivanka is not affiliated with anyone in the Trump family. Ivanka Trump took to social media on Thursday to warn her followers about the crypto coin, adding that her legal team would be pursuing measures to "stop the continued misuse" of her name. "It has come to my attention that a fake crypto coin called 'Ivanka Trump' or '$IVANKA' is being promoted without my consent or approval," the first daughter wrote on X. "To be clear: I have no involvement with this coin. This fake coin risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money." The coin has plummeted 45% in the last 24 hours. Then there was a coin that invoked the name of Barron Trump, the president's youngest son. The price of $Barron coin soared rapidly amid a cocktail of social media hype and misinformation, garnering a market value of more than $450 million. However, when it became clear that the token had no official connection to anyone in the Trump camp, the price plunged as much as 95%. CNBC anchor and DealBook editor Andrew Ross Sorkin was another target of meme coin madness. "Sorkincoin" hit the market shortly after the journalist's talk with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which they joked that someone should create a coin inspired by Sorkin. Sure enough, a token bearing his name was minted soon after. Sorkincoin topped $170 million in trading volume in 24 hours, CoinMarketCap data shows, and Sorkin only found out about the crypto when a friend texted him about it, he told "Squawk Box" on Friday. "I was going to say, strangely flattering, but completely unauthorized. We don't know who created it. It's just a very strange thing to watch this thing go," he added. The week's meme coin mania caps off a heady few months for the crypto space since President Trump won the election last November. Trump, who was branded the "crypto president" while on the campaign trail, unleashed a burst of optimism for cryptocurrencies in hopes that the new administration would loosen regulation of the space and even get the government involved in bitcoin by establishing a national reserve. A long-awaited executive order on Thursday was light on specifics, however. Notably, while it addressed the potential creation of a national crypto stockpile, it didn't indicate that the government would necessarily be buying digital assets. Instead, it said a group would examine the potential for a reserve "derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts." Elsewhere, the order was mainly related to the promotion of technology and clear regulations meant to support the space. Some on Wall Street have voiced skepticism over the exuberance that has gripped crypto recently. David Einhorn, the founder of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, noted that the market has entered the "fartcoin" stage of the cycle, wherein meme coins proliferate. "Nothing stops the launch of many more tradable coins," Einhorn wrote in his quarterly letter to investors. "It's anyone's guess as to what will happen next, but it feels like it's going to be wild."

Skrmetti and Roberts discussed a wide range of topics, from combating the ESG movement in Tennessee to his recent victory halting the Biden administration’s rewrite of Title IX. He detailed his concerns with the regulatory approach of the Biden administration, saying, “I think the apotheosis of that overreach has been the Title IX rule.” Title IX was enacted in 1972 to prohibit sex-based discrimination in schools and education programs that receive federal funding. Starting under the Obama administration and continuing during President Joe Biden’s reign, Democrats have attempted to use Title IX to advance their gender ideology agenda. That came to a halt Jan. 9 when a federal court in Kentucky ruled that the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX rule was unconstitutional. The Biden administration would have required educators to use pronouns inconsistent with a student’s sex and allowed students to use facilities that do not align with their sex. The case, called Tennessee v. Cardona, marked another major win for Skrmetti and Alliance Defending Freedom. Skrmetti, who sought to protect minors from LGBTQ+ ideology, called Biden’s effort a “totalitarian intrusion into every American school and university.” He explained how making major changes to American law through the current regulatory process bypasses key democratic principles. “You eliminate the need for consensus, you eliminate the transparency, you eliminate the public participation in the process, and ultimately, you alienate Americans from their government,” he warned. The attorney general hopes Tennessee v. Cardona and other regulatory cases brought by attorneys general will “force structural change in the approach of every executive branch.” When asked how America can continue to keep its system of law working, Skrmetti said, “When you look at the size and scope of the executive branch, Congress doesn’t have the muscle to exert real oversight.” He told Roberts that Congress does not have the necessary expertise to author “complicated legislation,” too often deferring instead to executive branch agencies. Watch the full episode of “The Kevin Roberts Show” to hear Skrmetti discuss the fight against government overreach, protecting minors from transgender ideology, and the ongoing U.S. v. Skrmetti case.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire George Soros' Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) stands against George Soros' long-term stock picks. George Soros is one of the most influential figures in finance, philanthropy, and global affairs. As the founder of Soros Fund Management and the Open Society Foundations, Soros has achieved monumental success as a hedge fund manager while using his wealth to champion democratic values, human rights, and social causes worldwide. Soros was born in Hungary during World War II, and his family survived Nazi occupation by securing false identities and hiding from persecution. In 1947, Soros fled Hungary and moved to England, where he studied at the London School of Economics. After graduating in 1952, Soros worked in various merchant banks before moving to the United States.

Soros began his career in finance in New York City, where he gained experience in arbitrage and securities trading. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management, which later became the Quantum Fund, one of the most successful hedge funds in history. Between 1970 and 2000, the Quantum Fund generated an average annual return of over 30%, making it one of the best-performing funds in history. In 1992, Soros became famous as the man who broke the Bank of England. He bet against the British pound, anticipating that it would be devalued due to economic pressures. His position netted him a profit of $1 billion in a single day, cementing his status as a legendary investor. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, his net worth is estimated at $7.2 billion. The 13F portfolio of his hedge fund is worth more than $6.9 billion.

For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Soros Fund Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Soros Fund Management's Stake: $5.5 million Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is a midstream natural gas and crude oil pipeline company with headquarters in Houston, Texas. The following key aspects make this company a standout investment. Firstly, as per the report of the fourth quarter of 2024, the reported net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion, or $0.65 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This portrays that the company is effectively improving its earnings per unit, reflecting operational efficiency and potentially leading to increased returns for shareholders. Also, an 8% increase was observed compared to $1.3 billion, or $0.60 per unit on a fully diluted basis, for the third quarter of 2023, demonstrating positive financial health and the company’s ability to attract more capital. Secondly, the company declared a quarterly distribution of $0.54 per common unit, maintaining its commitment to returning value to unitholders. This unit repurchase program shows the company’s approach to capital management, which would further enhance unitholder value through these buybacks. Overall EPD ranks 13th on our list of George Soros' long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of EPD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EPD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What does OpenAI get from Stargate? A $500 billion chance to build a whole new moat.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-stargate-project-moat-deepseek-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-24T12:53:23Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has a new $500 billion project called Stargate. Consider it an extraordinary attempt by the ChatGPT maker to build itself a whole new moat in the face of growing competition from rivals at home and a buzzy startup in China. This week, OpenAI revealed plans to shift focus and spend $500 billion on AI infrastructure over the next four years. Stargate will focus on hardware powering advanced AI software, such as data centers and energy supply — all with Donald Trump's blessing. It is a colossal amount of money, but OpenAI has two critical reasons for spearheading the initiative alongside key partners SoftBank, Microsoft, and Oracle. First, reaching what OpenAI boss Sam Altman calls an era of "superintelligence" depends on having access to more computing power. The industry insists that AI models will get smarter when given more of it, making ownership and access a priority. Stargate, then, offers OpenAI a chance to build itself the kind of formidable "moat" that Warren Buffett once said companies need to ensure they maintain a competitive advantage against rivals. A vast infrastructure empire belonging to OpenAI would certainly help give it that. The second reason for betting big on infrastructure through Stargate is even more critical: OpenAI may have no choice but to build itself a new moat in response to a Chinese startup that this week caused a stir in Silicon Valley. When OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT to the world, it was clear that the combination of a powerful AI model and an intuitive, consumer-friendly interface gave it a moat that was the envy of Silicon Valley. How much of a moat ChatGPT offers OpenAI has come under increasing debate. The latest challenge to OpenAI's moat came on Monday as a little-known Chinese startup called DeepSeek stunned America's top AI researchers after revealing a new AI model called R1. In a paper, it said R1 rivals the frontier AI model OpenAI introduced just four months ago, o1. Like o1, it reasons, meaning it thinks carefully before responding. According to DeepSeek, which has obtained an MIT license to open-source its model, R1 achieves "performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks." That an open-source Chinese company has been able to release a free model competitive with the best OpenAI has to offer has not gone unnoticed among AI's most prolific leaders. Jonathan Ross, the CEO and founder of Groq, an Nvidia rival backed by BlackRock and Samsung, responded to a question in Davos this week about DeepSeek's latest release by claiming "open models will win." "We cannot do closed models anymore and be competitive — open always wins," the former Google engineer said while noting that it will be harder to differentiate between models soon. As he put it, "The models are not going to be particularly special for long." Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and AI researcher, told Business Insider that he has been adamant for a year now that "closed source players have almost no obvious moat" and that it is "certainly even more true now" following DeepSeek's release. It's not the first time OpenAI's moat has been challenged. In May 2023, when Google was busy playing catch up to ChatGPT, an internal memo written by an engineer inside the search giant, published by research firm SemiAnalysis, warned that "we have no moat, and neither does OpenAI." Why? Because, in the engineer's view, the gap in capabilities between the models being worked on in Silicon Valley versus the open-source community was "closing astonishingly quickly." We are, of course, almost two years on from the warning issued in that memo, and OpenAI has since then convinced investors that it is of market-leading value, having completed a $6.6 billion funding round at a $157 billion valuation in October. Nathan Benaich, founder and general partner of AI-focused venture capital firm Air Street Capital, offered Business Insider one explanation for why OpenAI has retained favor, noting ChatGPT has things like ease of use and reliability that make it a top pick for customers. "OpenAI, I think, has won the spot of being CocaCola for consumers," he said. "Who is the Pepsi? The gap is large." Avijit Ghosh, an applied policy researcher at Hugging Face, doubled down on the point, telling Business Insider that while DeepSeek's R1 performance "challenges conventional wisdom about technical moats in frontier AI," he thinks the reality is more nuanced. "The real differentiation isn't in raw model performance anymore — it's in how these capabilities are integrated into practical applications and systems, and tech behemoths are still leagues ahead in being able to vertically integrate and commodify their models into products," he said. OpenAI offered a demonstration of this on Thursday following the release of Operator — an AI agent that serves as an assistant capable of booking everything from dinner reservations to travel. This is clearly impressive, but resting competitive advantage on AI agents and an easy-to-use interface may still not be enough in the face of an entire industry making "agentic AI" its focus. The AI industry's pace of innovation is relentless. Stargate offers OpenAI a chance to build a new moat that could well be tougher to replicate than a large language model or AI agent for a few reasons. For one, having more computing power is vital to scaling models to greater levels of intelligence, experts say. Dylan Patel, founder of research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business Insider: "Stargate is extremely important for OpenAI to be competitive because the access to compute is what enables them to keep scaling." Groq's Ross, meanwhile, told a panel in Davos that he sees access to infrastructure being so important in the future that "what countries are going to be tussling over is how much compute they have access to." If OpenAI does manage to get Stargate built, it seems it will do so to serve its own purposes. A report from the Financial Times this week said Stargate will exclusively serve OpenAI — a sign that the project is meant to give the company an edge. OpenAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Business Insider. Clearly, then, the Stargate announcement suggests OpenAI sees a chance to build a new moat. It just can't be expected to come easy. Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman noted that while the project is likely to work as a VC play, where the outcome is expected to be delivered at an unknown date in the future after serious investment, "raising $500 billion is going to be a real challenge." OpenAI remains lossmaking, and its key Stargate partners, like SoftBank and Oracle, the main equity funders alongside the UAE's MGX, have cash on hand that falls far short of the $100 billion initially being deployed. From a sheer capital position, a new moat won't be cheap. Building the data centers and clean energy sources forming this new moat will require nationwide coordination spanning multiple initial technology partners, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, OpenAI, and Arm. Construction of a data center site in Texas is underway, but the project will need to go much further. Hugging Face's Ghosh also thinks the "'compute is everything' narrative misses the mark," as small teams like Deepseek have shown "remarkable results through clever engineering." Still, OpenAI seems ready to go all in on Stargate to build a new moat. Its future leadership in the industry may well depend on its success. Jump to

Investing.com -- Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has suggested that it might be time to reinvest in Europe, citing an overabundance of pessimism about the region. His comments were made during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting on Friday. The Euro zone has seen a modest return to growth at the start of the new year, according to a survey released on the same day. This growth is attributed to stable services activity in January and a reduction in the long-standing downturn in manufacturing. Fink voiced his views during a panel discussion on the global economic outlook in Davos. He stated that there was "too much pessimism on Europe." His belief is that it might be the right time to start investing again in Europe, although he also acknowledged that there was still progress to be made, particularly in areas such as the capital markets union.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -There is too much pessimism around Europe and it could be time to be investing back in the region, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting on Friday. Euro zone business began the new year with a modest return to growth as stable services activity in January was complemented by an easing of the long-running downturn in manufacturing, a survey released earlier on Friday showed. "There's too much pessimism on Europe," Fink said during a panel debate on the global economic outlook in Davos. "I believe it's probably time to be investing back into Europe," he said, adding there was still progress to be made in areas such as capital markets union. On the same panel, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and ECB President Christine Lagarde agreed Europe needed to better mobilise capital to boost its economy. "We need to keep the talents at home, we need to keep the savings at home," said Lagarde, who characterised the global economic challenges facing Europe as Donald Trump's new presidency begins as representing "an existential threat". "If European leaders can get their act together and respond to this existential threat, there is a huge potential for Europe to respond to the call," she said. Speaking about the outlook for U.S. inflation, BlackRock's Fink said he was not too worried, adding that the U.S. Treasury yield curve reflected expectations for higher inflation and also fiscal deficits. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, trading at 4.64%, has risen from lows of around 3.60% in September. "I can see a scenario, I am not calling for it, where we see 5.5% on the 10-year (U.S.) yields," Fink said.

Title: DWS CEO Steps in as Private Credit Unit Struggles to Lure Cash

(Bloomberg) -- A few months into his role as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG’s asset management unit, Stefan Hoops presented shareholders his vision for growth with a “private debt muscle” as one key part of the strategy. Almost three years on, that plan is sputtering. Frankfurt-based DWS Group is struggling to attract sizable commitments from investors for a private credit fund targeting €1 billion ($1.05 billion), according to a person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, some senior sales staff have been heading to the exit because the pay is higher at US rivals, several other people said. With his blueprint to tap the hot $1.6 trillion market for private credit failing to take off, Hoops, 44, now plans to dedicate more of his time to give the business a much-needed boost, another person said. One idea being considered is to more strongly leverage parent Deutsche Bank’s client relationships for direct lending, that person added. All the people who spoke with Bloomberg News asked not to be identified because the information they discussed is private. DWS is among newcomers struggling to make a mark in the increasingly crowded private credit space, where even BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, has turned to acquisitions to rapidly scale up in a global market that Moody’s anticipates will grow to $3 trillion by 2028. But for some traditional active fund managers, the allure of high returns and management fees is turning into a mirage in the absence of such deals. Last year, Fidelity International halted its European direct lending activities and trimmed its private markets team. On the other hand, US alternatives giant Ares Management Corp. announced this month that it raised €30 billion for its latest European direct lending fund, the largest of its kind in the region. A representative for DWS declined to comment. Prior to joining DWS as CEO in June 2022, Hoops had little experience in asset management. He was brought in to steady the ship after a period of tumult surrounding allegations that the investment firm overstated its green credentials. Now the faltering private credit business has come as a major setback for him. At Deutsche Bank, Hoops caught the attention of CEO Christian Sewing with his cool head when Germany’s biggest lender was facing the threat of a costly settlement in the US. As head of the corporate clients unit that was central to Sewing’s turnaround plan, Hoops oversaw a rebound in the business that was struggling for a long time with negative interest rates. Hoops also scored some wins at DWS, including settling with US regulators probing allegations of greenwashing. He oversaw a 16% rise in total assets under management to €963 billion at the end of September, driven by inflows into lower-margin passively managed funds. The company’s shares have outperformed European peers in recent years. Now, those credentials will be put to the test as Hoops faces one of the biggest challenges of his career: establishing the firm’s private credit business. The alternatives unit of DWS, which is reporting full-year results on Jan. 30, looks unlikely to achieve its goal of a 10% compounded annual growth until the end of 2025, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The unit had €106 billion in assets under management at the end of September, down from €123 billion in 2022, when Hoops took over. The only bright spot of the alternatives unit in recent years has been its infrastructure business, which has attracted consistent inflows. In a bid to build out the unit, the firm did make some star hires. Paul Kelly joined from Blackstone Inc. in 2022 to run the alternatives unit. It also brought in Man Group Plc’s Dan Robinson as its EMEA alternative credit head. The business is currently launching its first collateralized loan obligation, Rhine CLO I. To be sure, Hoops told analysts in October that he expects the investments in alternatives to pay back over the longer term and promised a “packed agenda” for 2025. But the lack of fundraising has weighed on the business. A weak track record is making it even more difficult to mobilize capital, the people said. Getting clients to invest in DWS’s private credit offerings is also challenging because most customers prefer better established players over the new kid on the block, one person said. As a result, the division has seen some attrition among sales staff. Nestanlin Garcia, who oversaw alternatives client coverage in Germany, Austria and central eastern Europe, left for Blackstone in November. Alexander Hütteroth, who oversaw private debt coverage in the region, joined Brookfield Asset Management, their LinkedIn profiles show. Should organic growth fail to materialize, Hoops might revisit a list of potential acquisition targets of European asset managers with direct lending capabilities. Any deal size would be in the low to mid-single digit billion range, Bloomberg News has reported. DWS has also been among suitors that were studying a bid for German life insurance consolidator Viridium Group. The group of potential bidders also included BlackRock Inc. and Blackstone, Bloomberg News reported in October. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Crypto venture capital (VC) funding is expected to recover this year as regulatory clarity and more crypto-friendly policies emerge during the tenure of President Donald Trump, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report Wednesday. The Wall Street bank noted that venture funding for the industry has been subdued in recent years. This may have been due to enforcement actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the climate of regulatory uncertainty during the previous administration, analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. The start of the EU's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, which came into force at the end of December, is expected to "further bolster VC engagement," the report said. Still, the level of funding is unlikely to match previous peaks seen in 2021/22, JPMorgan said, as crypto venture capital firms face a number of challenges. Giants of traditional finance (TradFi) such as Blackrock (BLK) and Franklin Templeton are increasing their participation in the crypto market, and this leaves less market share for VC firms in stablecoins, tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), the bank said. Nascent crypto projects are avoiding large token sales to VCs and are increasingly turning to community-driven platforms to raise money, the report noted. High interest rates also present a challenge for VC funding, JPMorgan said. The growth of cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) products is "inducing a trend towards passive investing," and this could be diverting capital away from VC firms, the report added.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS)'s all-share buyout offer for Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) on Friday is the latest surprise twist of an increasingly complex banking saga. Long-awaited Italian banking consolidation has taken off in recent months, triggered by the state selling down its stake in MPS in November, paving the way for a third big banking group to compete with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) and UniCredit. The latter, not wanting to be left out of a wave of deal making, late last year made its own unsolicited play for Banco BPM, Italy's third-largest lender. The situation is made more complex by key shareholders in the banks involved owning stakes in other lenders as well as Italian insurer Generali (BIT:GASI).

Several parties are in contention even as potential buyers face a litany of legal hurdles and barriers. After stepping in to restore TikTok in the U.S. and delaying a law that would effectively ban the app, Trump is looking for avenues to keep the popular platform afloat. He has put forward a proposal for an American stakeholder to buy the company and then sell a 50% stake to the U.S. government, which will jointly run the app along with the private party. So, who are the likely contenders for one of the most popular apps in the U.S.? Trump has already flagged several major investors within his inner circle as acceptable buyers, one of which is Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk. The world's richest person is leading Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has close business ties to China and has voiced opposition to the TikTok ban. Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the Chinese government was considering a plan to have Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, citing anonymous sources. That followed a report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed TikTok's CEO had been soliciting advice from Musk ahead of Trump's inauguration. CNBC was unable to reach Musk for comment. "Elon Musk continues to be front and center as a potential bidder for TikTok which likely includes some tech partners/outside investors to get a deal done," Wedbush said in a research note on Wednesday. "Musk would be hand picked by Beijing and his ironclad relationship with Trump would make this a very logical choice in our view," the note added. Nat Schindler, an analyst at Scotiabank, also noted that Musk's acquisition of Twitter has demonstrated his interest in global social media platforms. However, he also sees some potential obstacles for the tech tycoon. "Musk is under fire already for owning X and the perception that he is using it to promote certain political ideas, and any involvement in TikTok could draw additional fire and potentially antitrust scrutiny," Schindler said. Trump has also said he'd "like" to see Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison purchase the platform. Ellison, a longtime Trump supporter, stood beside the President at a press conference on his AI infrastructure investment plans on Tuesday, where Trump was asked questions about a potential TikTok deal. "What I'm thinking about saying to somebody is, buy it, and give half to the United States of America. Half and we'll give you the permit," Trump said before turning to Ellison to ask if the deal sounded reasonable. "Sounds like a good deal to me Mr. President," Ellison replied. Ellison and his company are currently at the center of the TikTok dilemma, operating as a cloud infrastructure provider for ByteDance in the U.S. Given its existing relationship with Tiktok, Oracle and is "directly invested in Tiktok's success in the region," Scotiabank's Schindler said. Ellison had bid for Tiktok, along with Walmart, back in 2020 when Trump first pushed for a ban on the platform. Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comment. Trump had approved of the Walmart-Oracle deal in principle, which would've seen the tech and retail giants partner to take over the video-sharing app in the U.S., avoiding a shutdown. However, the Trump administration's attempt to ban TikTok in the U.S. fell through in the face of legal challenges. Ellison later joined a group of investors that helped Elon Musk buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, in 2022. "[We believe] Oracle/Ellison could play a pivotal role in any deal given their key technology partnership with TikTok and his appearance at the White House with Project Stargate," Wedbush said. Wedbush added that it expects a slew of TikTok bids to come over the coming weeks from a host of players with Musk and Ellison leading the pack. In addition to Musk and Ellison, experts flagged several other parties likely to be interested in a potential deal for TikTok, adding that the barriers to entry were high. Given the financial stakes of a TikTok deal, it's unlikely that some rogue investor is going to swoop in and buy the platform on the cheap, Paul Triolo of Albright Stone Group told CNBC. "While an up-to-date valuation on TikTok is difficult to come up with, it is likely to the order of $40-80 billion, meaning whoever decides to jump in has to be ready with some serious money," he said. He added that potential suitors are likely to include some of America's largest social media and technology players, such as Meta and Google, in addition to Musk's X. Meta and Google didn't immediately respond to a CNBC inquiry. Sarah Kreps, the director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University, however, warned that players such as Meta, Google and Musk getting a substantial stake in TikTok could raise antitrust questions. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler noted that there were also a number of other players, including existing investors BlackRock, Coatue, and General Atlantic, who own a large chunk of TikTok's parent company. According to him, some of these investors are likely to participate in any sale of the U.S. platform by investing in the new entity. "Other large VCs, hedge funds, and asset managers from Tiger to Fidelity would also likely show interest in a fast growing global platform with such a huge viewer base," said Schindler, adding that finding investors to own a part of Tiktok won't be a problem. The fervor surrounding a purchase of TikTok U.S. has also seen some unconventional players enter the fray. Social media superstar MrBeast — real name Jimmy Donaldson — who has more than 100 million TikTok followers has posted several videos in which he indicated serious interest in buying the platform, claiming he has had talks with billionaires. In one video, the internet personality claimed he had an official offer ready, jesting that he might be the new TikTok CEO. Media reports have also mentioned Donaldson and a group of investors preparing to make a bid for TikTok. On Thursday, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesperson for Donaldson, told CNBC that "Several potential buyers are in ongoing discussions with Jimmy, but he has no exclusive agreements with any of them." Led by Project Liberty Founder Frank McCourt and involving Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O'Leary, "The People's Bid for TikTok," has made a $20 billion cash offer to buy TikTok. O'Leary told CNBC last year that he wanted to buy the platform at a discount as any possible deal won't include TikTok's original algorithm. The organization said it already has a replacement for the algorithm to use for TikTok U.S. Following Trump's comments on a 50% stake in the platform, both McCourt and O'Leary told CNBC this week that they were interested in a TikTok deal and were hoping to work with Trump to make it happen. McCourt has also told CNBC that he wants TikTok to run a decentralized social networking protocol, or DSNP, overseen by the Project Liberty Institute, a nonprofit founded by the billionaire. Bidding interest aside, a number of legal and tech experts have told CNBC that Trump's executive order to delay the TikTok ban contradicts the Supreme Court's earlier ruling to uphold the PAFACA and could face legal opposition. O'Leary also told CNBC on Monday that a TikTok deal could not happen under the current law, after the Supreme Court upheld an impending ban on TikTok under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, or PAFACA, on Sunday. Beijing and its pending negotiations with Trump regarding trade with the U.S. is also expected to play a determining factor in whether the Chinese government would allow ByteDance to make a divestiture. "In this game of high stakes poker between the Trump Administration and Beijing it's clear TikTok is a big chip on the table," Wedush said Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Bank of Japan hikes ratesThe Bank of Japan on Friday hiked rates by 25 basis points to 0.5%, the highest level since 2008. Following the decision, the Japanese yen strengthened to 155.3 against the U.S. dollar as of 1:30 p.m. Singapore time. Earlier Friday, Tokyo released a report that showed core inflation in the country rising to a 16-month high at 3% in December on an annual basis, in line with expectations from a Reuters poll. Record close for S&PThe S&P 500 closed at a fresh high on Thursday as investors liked what they heard from Trump regarding rate cuts. All major U.S. benchmarks are on a four-day winning streak. Positive Wall Street sentiment lifted Asian markets on Friday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped more than 2%, but Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down after the rate hike. Trump's Davos addressU.S. President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, virtually on Thursday. In his speech, Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to "bring down the cost of oil," and called the European Union's trade relationship with the U.S. very unfair. Trump said he likes Xi "very much"Trump said Thursday that he likes Chinese President Xi Jinping "very much," according to the White House readout of his virtual interview at Davos. He floated the idea of working with Xi to end the war in Ukraine. Separately, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China released Thursday found that 30% of U.S. companies in China are accelerating their plans to relocate manufacturing or sourcing, the highest proportion since 2022. Crypto order signed by TrumpCryptocurrency advocates got another boost from Trump on Thursday after he signed an executive order to promote the advancement of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Most of the order focuses on establishing technology and rules around crypto. One of the critical pieces is the creation of a working group to consider a national digital asset stockpile. Boeing projects huge lossBoeing said Thursday that it likely lost about $4 billion in the fourth quarter, or a loss of $5.46 per share. Revenue will probably come in at $15.2 billion, lower than LSEG estimates. Boeing has not posted an annual profit since 2018. The aircraft maker began 2024 with a midair accident and ended it with a crippling labor strike and layoffs. [PRO] Fink goes against pessimism in EuropeThere's severe "pessimism" about the future of Europe at Davos, according to Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock. However, Fink told CNBC on Thursday things might be "near a bottom" — and explains why he's taking that view. Markets are supposed to run on numbers: past performance, projections of profits, return on equity. But words are equally powerful in their capacity to move markets, as Trump's virtual address to the World Economic Forum on Thursday demonstrated. The price of U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent dropped on Trump saying he'd "ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil." And after Trump said he would "demand that interest rates drop immediately," the 2-year Treasury yield, which tends to track short-term interest rates, edged lower, while stocks ticked up. In fact, the S&P 500 added 0.53% to close at a record closing high of 6,118.71. Its last all-time closing high was 6,090.27 in early December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.92% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.22%. It was the fourth consecutive session in the green for all three indexes. But unlike numbers — which are factual (most of the time, anyway) — words can be capricious. "Trump's Davos speech contained some ostensibly positive lines (he called for OPEC to lower oil prices, demanded central banks lower interest rates, and reiterated prior pledges to slash taxes and regulation) but there was very little either incremental or within his control," Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. That doesn't mean Trump won't carry through his declarations. It's unwise, however, to bank on comments ungrounded by concrete action. On the other hand, there are some words that have the heft of policy behind them and should be taken seriously by investors. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week. While the chance of a rate cut then is near zero, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool, what Chair Jerome Powell says at his press conference is "likely to cause market volatility," according to James Demmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research. Learning what to listen to, then, could be as important for investors as deciphering numbers. — CNBC's Alex Harring and Jesse Pound contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Yuno Energy CEO Cathal Fay: ‘Starting from zero, €600m in revenues is not so bad’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/01/24/cathal-fay-interview/
Time Published: 2025-01-24T05:45:00Z

Energy supplier Yuno started life in 2010 as “four middle-aged men above a second-hand bookshop in Blackrock”, Co Dublin. “We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else,” recalls its chief executive and co-founder, Cathal Fay. It was not the most auspicious year to start a business. An economic recession sparked by the collapse of the property market and the banks gripped the country. But the timing turned out to be good for Fay and his colleagues. Their idea was Prepay Power, pay as you go electricity, which allowed people to pay small amounts as they needed, instead of wrestling with big bills. “Ireland was a different place then,” Fay observes. “People responded well to the offer. You pay in small amounts when it suits rather than pay a big bill, and at that stage a big bill every two months was a big ask for consumers. They liked the fact that they could break it down, typically €20, down the shop. We got a great reaction to that.” Prepay went from zero to 2,000 customers by the end of 2011, then 12,000, then 20,000. Even when it ran out of cash to advertise, people kept coming. Its main constraint was getting finance to fund growth. Despite demonstrating that the idea worked, a year of dealing with advisors and meeting “various people around town” failed to get a result. Fay got an introduction through family to Ulric Kenny, then best known as founder of Ion Equity, whom he approached for advice. Instead, Kenny joined as an investor bringing along colleague Andrew Collins. He is the biggest shareholder and company chairman today. “That was a bit of luck,” says Fay. “Not just his investment, but we also got his business insights. He’s been a great chairman of the company.” Yuno is a different place these days. It has swapped the bookshop for an office in Sandyford on the capital’s southside. It has just bought Firmus Energy (Supply) Ltd in Northern Ireland, in a deal thought to be worth around €40 million. That brought in 113,000 homes and businesses, bringing its total customer numbers to more than 400,000. It now employs 600 people, and revenues will soon reach €600 million. In 2023, Yuno’s sales were €373 million while operating profits were €4.3 million. It supplies electricity, gas and home heating oil to customers. Along with Prepay, it has Yuno Energy, a bill-pay supplier. Prepay will continue as a mainstay of the business, but most future growth will come under the “Yuno banner”, Fay predicts. It plans to invest in the bill-pay operation and in recruiting commercial customers. Firmus is already the North’s leading supplier to business and state bodies. We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment In the south, Yuno has hired Ian Mulcahy, a 20-year industry veteran, to head up the section offering electricity and gas to businesses. That has been so far so good, according to Fay. “We’re getting on well in terms of meeting our launch targets in commercial customers,” he says, without revealing the numbers. “It’s an interesting contrast. One client brings a lot of gigawatt hours. They’re more dedicated customers, they can choose their own hedging strategies. We advise them and they decide whether they want to go to market or a fixed-rate for the year. So, we’re adjusting to bringing in the expertise, not just a head of department but also key account staff.” Yuno’s business customers can take a pass-through rate, tied to wholesale electricity market prices, which change every half hour, a fixed price for the year, or “any number of products in between”. The company has recruited some big customers, including well-known Irish retailer Smyth’s Toys. On the domestic side, its bill-pay business in the Republic has recruited 35,000 customers since its launch in late 2023. The company maintains that those who buy both electricity and gas save around €900 a year, compared to rivals’ standard rates if they switch, while electricity only customers are €500 better off. Prepay clients pay rates comparable to the standards on offer elsewhere, but benefit from a better service, Fay says. Yuno does not own power plants or gas reservoirs. Instead, it buys its energy on the open market, selling it on at a profit. But it does not buy at the wholesale price on offer at any given time: it agrees deals for electricity and gas months, or even a year or more, in advance of taking delivery, a process known as hedging. This is meant to cut out the risks of constant up and down movement in prices. Fay cites what happened in August 2022 as a good example of how this works. Electricity prices briefly rose to 10 times historic norms, as fear that there would not be enough gas to generate power gripped Europe. Anyone buying then would have had to pay the massively inflated price, but hedging agreements allowed suppliers such as Yuno to avoid this. It had bought a year earlier, when the electricity market was emerging from “the situation where energy prices had been low, so you could buy it at a low price for delivery in 12 months’ time”. However, Fay concedes that those forward prices are tied to what happens at the wholesale level, so homes and businesses still face increases and decreases, but without the dramatic peaks and troughs seen on the wholesale market. “Absolutely, yeah. You can’t beat the market,” he says. “What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility.” Essentially, success in the business hinges on getting the hedging strategy right. Yuno has 30 people working in its trading department, equating to 5 per cent of its employees. Its bill-pay business was launched as the pressure on prices eased in late 2023, allowing it to offer lower rates than rivals committed to hedging contracts struck at higher levels. Electricity prices are tied to gas, as this is the fuel used to generate most of the power used in Europe. They have been falling, but now there is a risk that they will head in the other direction. Russia recently shut a pipeline through Ukraine that provided around 5 per cent of Europe’s natural gas needs. This was expected, but it came during a cold snap when demand was already high, so price has been moving up steadily. We had an idea, an electricity licence and not much else “Well, gas went up 25 per cent in December,” Fay says. “This winter has been colder and calmer than last winter, so that means more demand for gas for heating, and calmer means more demand for gas for power generation. The market has been tight and nervous, so prices have gone up – really driven by the fact that in the colder, calmer conditions, gas storage is 15 per cent less than this time last year and less than the five-year average.” Europe competes with south-east Asia for gas supplies. In the medium term, volatility looks likely to continue, particularly as the continent will have to spend the summer replenishing its reduced gas stores, so pressure will remain on prices even as demand from homes and businesses subsides. While no one is likely to increase charges now, Fay maintains that all suppliers, his own company included, are watching this closely. Fay’s background as a qualified engineer clearly helps him grasp the various moving parts of the business he runs. After getting his primary degree from University College Dublin, he did a Master’s in computer applications in Trinity, and then went to work with Telecom Eireann, now Eircom. He left in 2000, moving to a company that produced ebooks and productivity software for personal organisers. “I found there that it was all about first-mover advantage, getting things to market quickly. We were first mover, but we found that there wasn’t a market,” he says. Then he worked with Red Circle, which developed ringtones and games for pre-smart phone mobiles. Strangely, this business was all about print advertising. “We’d take out a page in a magazine in the UK,” he says. “We’d know exactly how to optimise each centimetre of that space to maximise the number of ringtones that people bought. That gave us a significant advantage, so we grew big in the UK.” Red Circle was then sold to Irish company Zamano. Fay remained on until 2010, at which point the iPhone had taken over, so ringtones and games were all app-based. Around that time, he ran into a former colleague who was involved in pre-paid energy, prompting him to realise it could work here. Shortly afterwards, he made the move to the second-hand bookshop. Yuno is about to expand in yet another direction, district heating. This comes in two forms. One is a self-contained system where an apartment building is served by a single common boiler, which tenants draw on as needed, through heat exchangers in their homes. Yuno is already involved in such projects. The other is known as “networked” district heating, which draws heat from a single source to a group of buildings in the one area. In the Irish case, this would be industries such as data centres and pharmaceutical manufacturers, which generate quantities of wasted heat. District heating is common in Nordic countries so the systems for tapping it are tried and tested. Applying it here means that everybody wins, says Fay. It means a cheap source of heat for consumers, turning waste into revenue for the industries involved, which must pay for cooling, and cutting carbon emissions, as both the homes and the manufacturers are drawing on the same energy. You can’t beat the market. What you’re doing is trying to remove volatility The State’s climate action plan includes a commitment to this technology, but it needs infrastructure, ie, pipes connecting the data centres and pharma makers with apartment blocks and homes. Theoretically, that should not be difficult, as many of the industries are close enough to residential areas. An existing pilot scheme connects an Amazon facility with homes in Tallaght in west Dublin. “We’ve looked at a number of case studies,” says Fay. “Even in my own local area in Dun Laoghaire, there is a pharmaceutical company that generates heat, and there are umpteen number of apartment buildings that will take it.” The Government and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland have identified suitable sites themselves. Yuno has already hired someone with experience of this in Denmark to run this division. The next steps involve the Oireachtas passing laws enabling it, and for local councils to go from there and lay the pipes. Fay says there are indications that this is going to happen. “It cries out to be done, because we have so many data centres around Dublin that being able to take the waste heat from them is a useful way of supporting them in meeting their own climate change mitigation goals. But you can see that it’s likely to be on a longer timeframe than what we’re used to,” he says. The slower pace does not seem to bother Fay unduly. He’s had “plenty of scares” on the way to this point, he says. “We ran out of meters when we were just about to grow, while people were still calling us, despite us not advertising. We survived without paying ourselves while we were waiting for investment. So €600 million in revenues is not so bad from starting from zero.” Name: Cathal Fay Post: Chief executive, Yuno Energy Career: Began working life as an engineer with a master in computer applications, worked for Telecom Eireann – now Eircom – before moving to a firm that developed software for personal organisers and then to Red Circle, which provided ringtones and games for pre-smart mobile phones.

Akr21 Shares was also a top performer in the last seven days, adding almost 4,000 Bitcoins to its holdings. BlackRock’s holdings also include other digital assets, including ETH. In the same data shared by LookonChain, BlackRock added around 58 ETH but lags behind the acquisition of VanEck, with its 732 ETH tokens purchased in the last seven days. Although BlackRock adds a substantial number of ETH tokens, its investments in Bitcoin matter to the industry. The company’s Bitcoin purchases are often a measure of the market’s performance. Since launching the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock has consistently led the segment with aggressive purchases. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Bitcoin: “If everyone adopted a 2% or 5% allocation, you could see Bitcoin at $700,000” Incredible how far Bitcoin has come. 🟠 pic.twitter.com/psxP3aq4WI — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 22, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,000, a little lower than its closing price yesterday. Analysts are nonetheless optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory based on its recent success. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has shown confidence about the potential price of Bitcoin. Fink told the World Economic Forum that Bitcoin was becoming more and more popular with asset management companies and international investment funds. According to Fink, these companies desire BlackRock’s opinion on Bitcoin. If everyone owns Bitcoin and contributes 2% to 5%, the industry will reach $700k, Fink continued. In addition, Fink stressed that they are not endorsing Bitcoin, but rather highlighting its potential. Bitcoin could see some improvement under Trump, according to Samara Cohen, another BlackRock official. According to Cohen, Bitcoin is doing well in the market under Trump. Once regulations are clear, Cohen anticipates a banner year for Bitcoin. Featured image from Reuters, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Bitcoin’s Breakout At Davos: Global Elites Reckon With Crypto Revolution
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2025/01/23/bitcoins-breakout-at-davos-global-elites-reckon-with-crypto-revolution/

U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) In a bold statement at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Donald Trump declared that the United States would soon become the "world capital of artificial intelligence and crypto," thanks to an imminent surge in American energy production. This proclamation marks a significant departure from the previous administration's heavy-handed regulations, which stifled both innovation and growth in the energy, bitcoin, and AI sectors. Trump’s statement, once unthinkable at Davos, was met with a notable shift in tone. In years past, discussions about bitcoin and pro-energy policies would have been dismissed in favor of elitist agendas centered around ESG mandates, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and expanding global surveillance efforts. But this year, the tone was different. Wall Street's biggest players are no longer laughing at bitcoin—instead, they’re making bold predictions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that bitcoin could soar to $700,000, while Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong pitched the idea of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the governor of the central bank of South Africa. As the saying goes, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win.” The question now is, which stage are we in? President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise this week by pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder who had been serving a life sentence without parole. Ulbricht’s case became a symbol of government overreach, with many in the bitcoin and libertarian communities rallying behind the call for his release. Trump framed the decision as a victory for liberty and personal sovereignty, key principles that align with the ethos of bitcoin itself. Following the announcement, bitcoin’s price responded positively, underscoring the growing recognition of Ulbricht as a martyr of the digital age. His story serves as a stark reminder of the fight for financial freedom and the perils of government overreach in a rapidly digitizing world. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s ongoing convulsions amid its identity crisis showed themselves again this week with the announcement of Etherealize, a new entity focused on institutional adoption. Though initial rumors suggested it was a second Ethereum Foundation, it was later revealed to be an Ethereum Foundation-backed initiative aimed at integrating Ethereum into traditional finance. Etherealize’s mission is to market Ethereum’s scaling solutions and staking yields to institutions, an effort to maintain relevance in the face of a severe, long-term decline in the exchange rate between BTC and ETH. However, Ethereum’s continued centralization and lack of fixed monetary policy leave it vulnerable to insider-driven strategies that stand in stark contrast to bitcoin’s Nakamoto Consensus. Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream has taken another step toward bridging traditional finance and bitcoin with the launch of its asset management division, unveiling two institutional-grade funds—the Blockstream Income Fund and the Blockstream Alpha Fund. These funds offer regulated access to bitcoin investments with a focus on collateralized lending and active management strategies. The move underscores bitcoin’s maturity as a financial asset and its growing role in institutional portfolios. As institutions seek exposure to bitcoin, products like these provide a bridge between traditional finance and the bitcoin ecosystem, leveraging its unique attributes without compromising its core principles. The speculative excesses of the crypto space were on full display this week with the launch of $TRUMP, a meme coin that briefly reached a staggering $14.5 billion market cap before crashing. With 80% of its supply concentrated in the hands of insiders, the rise and fall of $TRUMP served as a cautionary tale about the speculative frenzy that often grips altcoin markets. Although meme coins may be fun for some who enjoy gambling, they lack the fundamentals and staying power that constitute an asset worthy of investment. All of this activity comes at the same time as extremely bullish predictions from industry leaders. Some analysts suggest that bitcoin trading above $100,000 is akin to a coiled spring, poised for a significant upward breakout. As mentioned above, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink predicted that bitcoin could reach $700,000. Not to be outdone, David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc. and key contributor to the Trump administration’s bitcoin strategy, targets a price of $1 million per coin within four years. The events at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, along with the unveiling of the Trump administration’s bitcoin policy, mark the beginning of a new era. The once-dismissed digital asset is now becoming recognized as a legitimate and vital component of the financial system. With geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and economic uncertainty on the rise, bitcoin’s value proposition has never been clearer. Whether it’s being used as a hedge against currency debasement, an investment vehicle for institutions, or a strategic reserve for sovereign states, bitcoin’s role is expanding at an unprecedented pace. The question is no longer if bitcoin will be widely adopted, but how quickly the transition will take place. As 2025 unfolds, one thing is certain: bitcoin’s march toward mainstream acceptance is well underway, and those paying attention stand to benefit the most. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Four bed bungalow in Blackrock with its own fruit trees is packed with happy history of four generations

This Co Dublin bungalow, which has stayed in the family since it was built in the 1940s, offers easy access to the sea and village, and its own fruit trees Ann Connolly Redmond and her daughter Rachael Fisher in the kitchen of the family's Blackrock home Pic. Bryan Meade Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock The living room One of the four bedrooms The kitchen The hallway 1 St Vincent’s Park, Blackrock, Co Dublin Asking price: €695,000 Agent: DNG (01) 283 2900 ​If Ann Connolly could bottle the homely authenticity of No 1 St Vincent’s Park in Blackrock, she could sell it by the bucketload with the business she works for, a lifestyle store where goods are taken home in repurposed cement bags and where the ethos is all about “the connections between makers and customers”. Connolly works for Amanda Pratt, who was part-owner owner and chief buyer of lifestyle brand Avoca before it was bought by global food service and facilities company Aramark. Pratt recently opened Amo & Pax, a lifestyle outlet in Kilmacanogue, Co Wicklow, which sells furnishings and accessories that wouldn’t look out of place in Connolly’s family home. It all seems “full circle-ish”. Connolly’s uncle Brendan built a business around local shops: Doyle’s hardware and toy shops – of which there were six, including one in Dun Laoghaire and another in Parnell Street in the city centre. Another uncle, Paddy, had a supermarket in Gelnageary and greengrocers in Dalkey and Sandymount. But, of course, you can’t buy family history. The apple trees and rhubarb crowns planted in the back garden of No 1 by Conolly’s grandmother remain productive to this day. The collective energy and memories of four generations of her family infuse the atmosphere of the post-WWII bungalow near Blackrock village. Here, light-touch improvements carried out over generations have given it the sort of burlap-and-treasure-box character lifestyle store owners dream of. The living room Connolly now lives in Bray and travels constantly to trade shows as part of her job with Pratt, with whom she has worked since the Avoca days. Meanwhile, she has also been tasked with the job of divesting the property that has been home to her family for four generations. It isn’t an easy one. “It is so heartbreaking,” she says. “It has so many stories. “Unfortunately, my mother passed away last February. She was 93 years of age, but she had been in a nursing home for the last four years with dementia. My dad died in 2017, when he was 84. My lovely daughter, Rachel Fisher, has lovingly minded No 1 for the past few years and has looked after the apple trees and all the loganberries, whilst sea-swimming almost every day down in Seapoint, which is a really short cycle away.” Connolly’s family saga on this patch of ground goes right back to chapter one. The home her grandparents moved into in the late 1940s was built by The Daughters of Charity, whose convent, Dunardagh, possessed large tracts of land in this area of south Co Dublin, where the nuns had been heavily involved with health care and social services since the mid-1800s. One of the four bedrooms In the middle of the 20th century, the perennial Irish problem of a shortage of family homes was as familiar an issue then as it is now. “There were six families living up in Dunardagh,” Connolly says. “And I don’t really know why but my granny and granddad, Ellen and Joseph Doyle, were one of those families and basically the nuns commissioned 40 houses to be built at St Vincent’s Park, of which my grandparents had first dibs. “They picked No 1, because my granny originated from Co Offaly and she wanted a patch that she could plant apples and have a few chickens. The big apple tree in the back garden has to be 70 years old. Her loganberries are still there too. She was a great gardener and loved to cook. Everyone always ate well in this house.” The kitchen The Doyles went on to raise two girls and five boys in what was then a three-bedroom house. They extended the house over time, adding a kitchen at first, then an indoor bathroom – the first house in the estate to have one – and later a granny flat. For her part, Connolly was born and spent her very early life in England, where her parents Peggy and Gerry had moved. She was five when they came on holiday to Ireland and ended up staying after Ellen, her grandmother, became unwell. “So then we just grew up in Blackrock, and it was fantastic,” she says. “We would saunter down to the sea and be jumping off diving boards, strolling back, going into the sweet shops. “My brother and I would be sent to get the messages on a Saturday morning, and we would have our list – go to the butchers, and the fish shops and so on. Our neighbours in No 2, the O’Briens, owned the local fruit and veg shop.” The now 1,130sq ft semi-detached bungalow is on a corner plot in a cul-de-sac off Temple Road. It currently has four bedrooms, an entrance porch, a living room, a kitchen/dining room, a bathroom and a guest toilet. The fourth bedroom – originally the granny flat – is now connected to the main building. Number 1 St Vincent's Park, Blackrock There is a side entrance to the back garden and a well-tended front garden populated with rose bushes and other shrubs. While you cannot park directly outside the house, there is on-street parking and a small green, where older children might like to play. The house currently has oil-fired heating and a building energy rating of F, which the next owners may want to improve on. The interior is tastefully decorated in neutral colours, set off by selected furniture and accessories. The living room has polished timber floors and a fireplace with a wood-effect stove. The kitchen/ diner is bright and overlooks the back garden and granny’s apple tree. It has a chequerboard floor and green storage presses. For wannabee Blackrock residents, getting in there is difficult and expensive these days. Out of roughly 50 listings currently on myhome.ie, for example, only 20 are valued at under €800,000. Three-bed terraced townhouses are currently asking in the region of €550,000 whilst some semis are asking upwards of €775,000. Number 1 St Vincent’s Park has an asking price of €695,000 with DNG.

"I think we have to expect that President Trump will say something every day that gets a ton of coverage," he said. "We need to monitor these statements, but, look, we can't expect all of them to generate actionable investing ideas, even if they do produce bullish animal spirits that boost the market." Cramer encouraged investors to take some of the president's big-picture proclamations with a grain of salt, saying such broad ideas aren't what usually move the market. He also said that some of Trump's plans might not play out at face value, he continued, such as the president's sweeping energy policy meant to encourage drilling. Oil producers may not immediately take advantage of these allowances, Cramer said, and so the wider group isn't investible just yet. And Trump's demands to lower interest rates hold little weight, Cramer continued, as the Federal Reserve makes those decisions. The president would need to shrink the budget deficit to send rates lower, Cramer added. But Trump can invoke some catalysts, Cramer said, and he pointed to White House's recent announcement that it's partnering with Big Tech names like Oracle and Nvidia to invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The major data center buildout verifies the demand for products from companies like Nvidia, he continued. One theme poised to see lasting success is banks, Cramer said, due to Trump's proclivity for deregulation. BlackRock is tied to the bull market Trump wants to fuel, he said, and Goldman Sachs stands to benefit from increased merger activity. However, Trump's criticism of Bank of America for supposedly refusing to serve conservatives is not an investible idea, Cramer continued. The bank denied the accusation. "Trump wants the banks to succeed, and a higher stock market is the badge he craves," he said. "Even if he's saying bad things about Bank of America." The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment. Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

The shares were sold at a price of $1,010 each on January 21, 2025. Following this transaction, Kushel holds 68,433.34 shares directly.

Additionally, Kushel exercised stock options to acquire 10,000 shares at a price of $513.50 per share. This transaction added $5.135 million to his holdings, which now total 78,433.34 shares. Kushel's indirect holdings include shares managed through various family trusts.

Discover more insights about BlackRock's valuation and growth prospects in the comprehensive Pro Research Report, available exclusively to InvestingPro subscribers. In other recent news, BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink has publicly advocated for the tokenization of bonds and stocks, a move that could potentially democratize investing. This follows BlackRock's impressive earnings report, with adjusted operating earnings per share (EPS) of $11.93, surpassing both Keefe, Bruyette & Woods' (KBW) and consensus estimates. KBW has consequently increased its price target on BlackRock shares and maintained an Outperform rating. In addition, BlackRock's strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 has led to a positive outlook from Citi, highlighting accelerating fee growth and flow strength. The firm experienced a 7% growth in base fees during this period, with revenue growth of 10.2%. However, BlackRock also announced the resignation of Mark Wiedman, head of the Global Client Business, a significant change in the firm's leadership team. JPMorgan has responded to these recent developments by raising BlackRock's price target while maintaining a Neutral stock rating. These are among the recent developments concerning BlackRock.

(Bloomberg) -- Texas and nine other Republican-led states are ratcheting up pressure on Wall Street’s diversity programs, asking firms about their policies on hiring and supplier selections as the Trump administration moves to gut DEI. Most Read from Bloomberg What Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote on Thursday to the firms saying they appear to “unlawfully advance discriminatory” diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, and demanded they respond to a series of questions about their programs. He said the companies may have breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing an “ulterior political motive or agenda.” The letter was sent to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and money manager BlackRock Inc. “You appear to have embraced race- and sex-based quotas and to have made business and investment decisions based not on maximizing shareholder and asset value, but in the furtherance of political agendas,” Paxton said in a letter obtained by Bloomberg. Paxton gave the firms 45 days to respond to the questions. “Before pursuing legal action, we are extending to each of you an opportunity to avoid a lengthy enforcement action,” he wrote. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup declined to comment, while BlackRock and the other banks haven’t provided a response. The letter comes after Trump, in his second day in office, ordered federal contractors to affirm they don’t “engage in illegal discrimination, including illegal DEI.” He directed government agencies to draw up a list of publicly traded companies for potential investigations into compliance violations. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officers said on Wednesday that they will continue to focus on efforts to promote DEI in their workforces and customer bases. “We’re going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,” JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon said. The attorneys general cited pledges and goals made and set by finance firms since 2021 to bolster hiring of women and minorities. For example, JPMorgan pledged to hire 4,000 Black students by 2024 and Goldman set a goal of spending more than $1 billion on diverse vendors. Corporate America ramped up its diversity efforts in the wake of the MeToo movement and the 2020 death of George Floyd that sparked nationwide unrest. In November, Paxton led a move to sue BlackRock, Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. for allegedly breaching antitrust laws by using climate investing strategies to suppress coal production. BlackRock said the suggestion that it invested money in companies with the goal of harming them “is baseless and defies common sense.” In Thursday’s letter, Paxton also asked firms about their net zero emissions commitments and use of shareholder votes and conversations with companies to shift away from fossil fuels. For instance, the attorneys general asked BlackRock for details about communications it had with Climate Action 100+, an environmental group, and reasons for backing shareholder proposals focused on climate change. They also asked banks for information related to the steps they have taken to meet net zero goals. Financial firms, including the six cited by Paxton, have quit climate groups since early last month. The attorneys general that joined Paxton in sending the letter to the banks and BlackRock include those from Utah, Iowa, Indiana and Alabama. --With assistance from Georgia Hall.

Title: Larry Fink says Bitcoin is going all the way to $700,000

This story incorporates reporting from Inside Bitcoins and Inside Bitcoins. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing volatility as major coins see substantial price movements. Bitcoin, having recently dipped more than 3% to $102,661.93, has secured attention at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink offered a bold prediction of Bitcoin reaching a remarkable $700,000. Fink points to small allocations by asset managers, alongside Bitcoin’s potential to counter fiat currency debasement, as key drivers behind this projection. During his discussion with Bloomberg on January 22, Fink outlined how a mere 2-5% allocation to Bitcoin from asset managers globally could propel its price to the target figure. He contends that investors concerned about the potential weakening of their domestic fiat currencies, or who have concerns about their country’s political and economic stability, can turn to Bitcoin as a reliable hedge against such risks. According to Fink, Bitcoin’s global nature enables it to act as a “secure international currency” to mitigate local uncertainties. In a contrasting viewpoint, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, talking to CNBC, emphasized that Bitcoin does not pose a threat to the U.S. dollar, yet acknowledged its significance as an “interesting speculative asset.” Solomon affirmed his belief in the dollar’s dominance but expressed keen interest in the technology underpinning Bitcoin. He hinted that blockchain could eventually reduce operational friction within the broader financial system, although regulatory and operational restrictions currently limit banks’ direct involvement with Bitcoin. These remarks occurred amid a broader, albeit mild, pullback in Bitcoin’s price. Analysts observed the trend with Bitcoin slipping approximately 2% further, trading at $102,628, accompanied by a noticeable decrease in trading volume — down 20% to $61 billion. The fluctuation highlights the current unstable nature of the crypto market, posing both opportunities and pitfalls for investors. Fink’s optimistic outlook contrasts notably with the general market sentiment characterized by recent price declines. His insights present a longer-term bullish narrative amidst current short-term price corrections. Whether Bitcoin’s price will approach his ambitious forecast may depend on broader adoption trends and how effectively the asset addresses investors’ demands for stability and inflation protection. As global economic conditions evolve, these factors will play pivotal roles in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory.

Title: Who’s in the Cabinet? All the Ministers appointed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and their roles
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/01/23/whos-in-the-cabinet-all-the-ministers-appointed-by-taoiseach-micheal-martin-and-their-roles/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T19:33:06Z
Full Content:
The new Government finally comes into power a day later than planned and just under two months after the general election on November 29th last. Here is the new line-up: Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin’s return to the role of Taoiseach got off to a turbulent start after an unprecedented 24-hour delay, following chaotic Dáil scenes over speaking rights for Independents supporting the Government. But with the row over for now, the 64-year-old starts his new administration in full command of his party with a secure majority and confident of a full term for this administration, allowing for more rows and possible resignations along the way. [ The Irish Times view on the chaos at Leinster House: a shambolic day in the DáilOpens in new window ] A normally shrewd, savvy and ruthless operator when necessary, he is a great political survivor who has rebuilt the party after its disastrous 2011 election when it lost 57 seats. He is the longest-serving Fianna Fáil leader after Éamon de Valera. Most political colleagues, even some of his fiercest critics, will always describe him as a “decent man”. Vastly experienced, he has served not just as taoiseach and tánaiste, but also as a minister for education, enterprise and employment and health, and until now as minister for foreign affairs and defence. A member of Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995, he was first elected to the Dáil in 1989, before which he worked as a secondary schoolteacher. Ireland’s youngest taoiseach when he secured the job in March 2024 at the age of 37, Simon Harris moves to Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. With a lot of travel, this could be tricky for a party leader with ambitious backbenchers. But with 22 of the 38 Fine Gael TDs new to the Dáil, and a prospective reshuffle when he rotates again to taoiseach, this should not be a problem. His new team will look to him as something of an elder statesman after 15 years in politics and an astoundingly rapid rise through the ranks. A councillor at 22, a TD at 24 in 2011 and minister for health at the age of 29, he ran his local election campaign almost entirely on social media, winning the highest vote in the State. The 2020 election was called before a vote of no confidence in him as minister for health could be taken. But his performance and communication skills during the ensuing Covid pandemic rehabilitated and burnished his image and his high profile eventually led to his moniker as the “TikTok taoiseach”. His popularity ratings and those of his party took a hit with a series of mishaps in the election. Still, with 10 seats fewer than Fianna Fáil, he has done well to retain seven Cabinet seats and will have 26 months as taoiseach. Paschal Donohoe (50) starts his third term as Minister for Finance, following his second stint at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, a further signal of the Government’s “stability” message. Fine Gael TD for Dublin Central since 2011, he is now the party’s longest-serving Cabinet member and its most influential. An assured political and media performer, he is a skilled exponent of the “whatever you say, say nothing” philosophy. Currently president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, a position he is expected to retain, he previously served as minister for transport, tourism and sport, and minister of State for European affairs. First elected to Dublin City Council in 2004, he served a term in the Seanad from 2007 following an unsuccessful general election bid for the Dáil. In the last Dáil term he admitted to a breach in electoral rules by receiving a corporate donation in 2020 above the legal limit. Affable and well-read, he writes book reviews for The Irish Times and other publications. A Trinity graduate, he previously worked as a sales manager for a multinational company. [ Does Paschal Donohoe haggle? ‘I get enough of that at budget time so I leave shopkeepers in peace’Opens in new window ] The State’s youngest minister for finance when he was appointed in June last year, Jack Chambers (34) previously served as a minister of state in the department with responsibility for financial services. He has been a TD since 2016 when he was elected as the youngest member of the Dáil in that election, having previously been a councillor and serving as mayor of Fingal. Educated at the private Dublin boys’ school Belvedere College, Chambers has a degree in law and politics from Trinity College and graduated from the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland in 2020, completing his final medical exams while a TD. He is from Castleknock in his Dublin West constituency and has had a rapid rise through the political ranks. A protege of Micheál Martin, who appointed him as Fianna Fáil deputy leader, he is perceived as a steady hand. Generally low-key, he has shown his combative side in media interviews and Dáil rows. He has also served as minister of State for sport, the Gaeltacht and defence, and minister of State in the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment. Viewed as “solid”, “capable” and “steady”, Peter Burke (42) has, as expected, retained the Cabinet portfolio Harris first appointed him to, at a time when challenges for Ireland have intensified following the inauguration of US president Donald Trump. At the outset of the Fine Gael general election campaign, he provoked controversy when Michael O’Leary launched the Longford-Westmeath TD’s own campaign and said there were “too many” teachers in the Dáil. The married father of two grew up on a farm near Mullingar and is a horseracing fan. Popular within Fine Gael, Burke was first elected to the Dáil in 2016, after serving since 2009 as a Westmeath councillor and on Mullingar Town Council. Before his Cabinet appointment he served as minister of State for housing with responsibility for local government and planning and as a minister of State for European affairs. He graduated with a degree in commerce from NUI Galway in 2004, and worked as a chartered accountant for 10 years. After huge speculation, Jim O’Callaghan has been confirmed as Minister for Justice in a newly expanded department that will include immigration. This is an issue he has been concerned with because of the tent city that grew around the IPAS (International Protection Accommodation Services) offices in Dublin city centre, part of his Dublin Bay South constituency. The 56-year-old had made no secret of his ambition for the role but because of a difficult relationship with the leadership, doubt was cast on his chances. In 2020 he turned down the role of junior minister in the department, opting to remain on the backbenches. A barrister and senior counsel, he is the party’s spokesman on justice and was Fianna Fáil’s legal adviser before his first election to the Dáil in 2016. Well regarded by his colleagues, he is a strong and incisive contributor to Dáil justice debates. A brother of broadcaster and presenter Miriam O’Callaghan, he lives in Ranelagh and played rugby to a high level, representing UCD, Cambridge University, London Irish, Wanderers, Leinster and Connacht at senior level. He also represented Ireland at under-21 level. He holds degrees in law from UCD, Cambridge University and the King’s Inns. When Helen McEntee (38) won a Dáil seat in the 2013 byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee, it was the first Fine Gael byelection victory while in government since 1977. From Castletown, Co Meath, she is a DCU graduate and worked in financial services before becoming personal assistant to her father. She served as minister of State for mental health and older people for a year and then as minister of State for European affairs when Leo Varadkar was taoiseach. Appointed minister for justice in 2020, she focused on violence against women and implemented innovative anti-coercive control legislation. She also became the first Cabinet member to take maternity leave while in office in 2021 and again for the birth of her second child. Challenges in justice including migration, crime and public safety sparked sharp criticism, particularly following the riots in the capital in November 2023 which resulted in a Dáil vote of no confidence that she survived. She topped the Meath East poll in the 2024 general election. [ Helen McEntee: The next Fine Gael leader in waiting?Opens in new window ] [ Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien interview: ‘Fair-minded’ people will see housing progress by electionOpens in new window ] Darragh O’Brien (50) is moving from housing to the Departments of Transport and Environment and Climate Change. He is moving from one crisis – in housing – to another in the environment. There will also be much speculation as to whether he will be the Minister who finally gets the Dublin MetroLink under way. From Malahide, Co Dublin, he has been involved in politics for 20 years, starting as a councillor on Fingal County Council in 2004 before his election to the Dáil in 2007. He worked in the financial services sector dealing with pensions as an area manager for Friends First Assurance Company, before entering full-time politics. After losing his Dáil seat in the 2007 election, he successfully ran for the Seanad on the Labour panel before his re-election to the Dáil in 2016, when he topped the poll, building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. Ebullient and a political scrapper, he frequently came to verbal blows with his staunchest critic, Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin. Fianna Fáil will hope Norma Foley’s retention in Cabinet can solidify their standing in Kerry against the high-profile and effective Independent Healy-Rae brothers. During the election she came in for some criticism over conditions in the courthouse in Tralee. The 54-year-old TD grew up in politics following her father Denis Foley, winning a seat on her third attempt in 2020. A secondary schoolteacher, she was appointed to Cabinet in her first Dáil term, during the Covid pandemic. The Junior Certificate exams were abandoned and there were errors in the coding of the Leaving Certificate calculated grades system, for which she was forced to apologise. The pandemic resulted in grade inflation in State exams, the final reset of which is expected this year. She leaves the department as the challenges of AI facing education intensify. A low-key but assured performer, she held her cool and staunchly defended her initiative in the budget controversy over the €9 million phone pouches spend, which was ridiculed by the opposition and divided some in the teaching profession. Patrick O’Donovan (47) moves from Further and Higher Education to which he was appointed in June last year to a more high-profile job where his often blunt speaking has provoked strong reactions. The Limerick county TD was first elected to the Dáil in 2011, having previously served as a county councillor. He trained as a schoolteacher and also worked as an industrial chemist. In June 2023 he collapsed while taking questions in the Dáil and was rushed to hospital but recovered well. With a reputation as a political street fighter, he was frequently sent out to bat for Fine Gael on controversial issues before his appointment as a minister of state. He served from 2016 as minister of state for sport and in 2017 was appointed as a junior minister in finance and public expenditure. He also served as minister of State for the OPW, but had moved to the higher education portfolio when the controversy over the cost of the Leinster House bike shelter erupted. Qualified as both a solicitor and a barrister, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill (44) also has a PhD in public policy. A strong media performer, she has frequently clashed with Sinn Féin in the Dáil and on the airwaves. She is understood to have had a keen interest in the challenging health portfolio and will need all her qualifications and skills as she is expected to face significant challenges from day one in the job. She joined Fine Gael as legal adviser when Enda Kenny was opposition leader and was elected to Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council in 2019 before her election to the Dáil in 2020. A prominent first-time Fine Gael TD, she was appointed minister of state for finance in 2022 before moving to the role of minister of state for European affairs and for defence. During the 2020 election campaign she was harassed by a man who sent her sexually explicit videos and who was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to the offence, receiving a one-year suspended jail sentence. She has a son with former Ireland rugby international Hugo MacNeill. Martin Heydon (46) starts his fourth Dáil term with a promotion to full Cabinet role in the agriculture portfolio, where he has some experience. His appointment makes him the first senior Minister in Kildare since Charllie McCreevy in 2004. A member of Fine Gael’s government formation negotiations team, he is popular with and highly regarded by his party colleagues and the wider Dáil community. He has a level-headed approach to politics and rarely loses his cool in Dáil rows or arguments over the airwaves. From a farming background, he is a graduate of Kildalton Agricultural College and served as minister of state in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the last government. He joined Fine Gael in 2008 and was elected to Kildare County Council in 2009 before his 2011 election to the Dáil. From 2016 to 2020, he was chair of the Fine Gael parliamentary party. The father of four is married to former Kildare Gaelic footballer Brianne Leahy, a two-time All Star winner, and they live outside Kilcullen village. James Browne’s involvement in the government formation talks for Fianna Fáil and his successful stewardship of the long-awaited Gambling Bill through the Dáil and Seanad undoubtedly contributed to his elevation to the senior ranks of Government. A serious, no drama politician from Enniscorthy he studied hotel management and worked for a number of years in various roles in bars and hotels. Returning to study law, he qualified as a barrister in 2006. He served as a Wexford county councillor from 2014 until 2016 when he was first elected to the Dáil and at the following two general elections. Fianna Fáil spokesman on mental health, he introduced initiatives to reform mental health services in Ireland. A minister of state in 2020 in the Department of Justice, he had responsibility for law reform and youth justice. The 49-year-old also served on the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare. He is the son of former TD and minister of state John Browne and his great uncle Seán Browne, was also a TD for Wexford, first elected in 1957. Mayo Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary (51) gets a second chance as a senior Minister in Government with his appointment to the money-spending departments of Social Protection and Community and Rural Affairs. Following the 2020 general election there was shock that he had been snubbed for a senior portfolio and was instead offered the role of chief whip. Shortly afterwards he was appointed minister for agriculture following the sacking of Barry Cowen from the role. But controversy erupted when he attended a parliamentary golf club dinner in Clifden in breach of Covid regulations and he stood down the day after the issue became public, only weeks after his appointment. He was appointed minister of state for trade promotion, digital transformation and company regulation last year. From 2009 to 2011 he was minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation. Viewed as capable and calm and well like by his colleagues, he comes from a family of politicians, following his father Sean and grandfather Phelim into the Dáil. The Kildare North TD James Lawless joins the Cabinet at the start of his third term as a TD. He was appointed a minister of state last year to the Department of Transport, and was involved in dealing with the aftermath of Storm Darragh and the chaos following the resultant closure of the Holyhead port. Prior to his first election to the Dáil in 2016, he was a member of Kildare County Council for two years from 2014. He served as mayor of Naas during that period. Before becoming an elected representative, he was an activist campaigner on numerous commuter issues. A barrister by profession having attended King’s Inn, he also worked for VHI Healthcare insurance. He has degrees in maths and computer science from Trinity College Dublin. Originally from Wexford, he lives in Sallins with his wife Ailish, a primary schoolteacher. They have two daughters. Rossa Fanning SC (48) stays on as Attorney General, the Government’s legal adviser, following his initial appointment in 2022. He has advised on a number of controversial areas including the failed referendums on carers and the family. In unpublished advice which later became public, he said there was legal uncertainty over the proposed word “strive” would be more forceful than “endeavour”, currently in the Constitution. He also advised that it would have “real effects” that could be enforced by the courts. A graduate of Blackrock College in Dubin and UCD where he was auditor of the Law Society, he was a Fulbright scholar and came first in his class at the King’s Inns. A specialist in commercial law, his expertise in insolvency cases and business disputes made him a key player in many prominent post-Celtic Tiger era cases. He became a senior counsel in 2016. He was involved in high-profile cases involving some of the biggest names in corporate Ireland including Denis O’Brien, Larry Goodman, Dermot Desmond and Michael Smurfit and large multinationals such as Google and Facebook, along with financial institutions, investment funds and media companies. Galway West TD Hildegarde Naughton and former government chief whip did not secure a senior Government portfolio but retains her seat at Cabinet as a Super Junior Minister covering Disability. Her reappointment means County Galway will have three Super Juniors with Independents also at Cabinet. The former primary schoolteacher was elected to Galway City Council in 2009 and became mayor in 2011. After an unsuccessful Dáil bid she was nominated to the Seanad in 2013 and in 2016 won a Dáil seat, elected again in 2020 and in 2024. In 2020 she was appointed as a super junior minister of state in the departments of climate change and transport, with responsibility for aviation and subsequently to health, where she had responsibility for drugs strategy. Last year she was appointed government chief whip by Simon Harris when he took over as taoiseach. An accomplished singer, she is a classically trained soprano singing with Bel Canto, a group she cofounded. She has also won awards for her performances in musical theatre. After 22 years in the Dáil, Noel Grealish will sit at the Cabinet table as a Super Junior Minister in the Department of Agriculture. The Galway West TD (58) has been a TD since 2002 when he was elected as a member of the Progressive Democrats and again in 2007 for that party, taking on the leadership role when then leader Ciarán Cannon decided to join Fine Gael. He stayed on as leader until 2009 when the party finally disbanded. He has successfully held his seat as an Independent and his younger brother Tómas joined the Carnmore-based TD in politics when he was elected to Galway County Council. The former owner of a glass company, he landed himself in hot water over comments about asylum seekers in Oughterard, but he has strong and loyal support and is viewed locally as having a very strong constituency work ethic. Former minister of State for the OPW and flood relief, Seán Canney, now takes on a Super Junior ministerial role in the Department of Transport. He has advocated for the reopening of the Western Rail Corridor to trains from Galway to Claremorris. The 64-year-old from Tuam, Co Galway comes from a farming family is a quantity surveyor by profession and worked in the private sector for 25 years. Before his election in 2016 to the Dáil, he was a lecturer in construction economics and quantity surveying. Mr Canney said he had requested the restoration of the controversial travel and subsistence allowance, worth about €32,000 annually, to ministers of state. He said non-payment of the allowance penalised office holders. “If you were going into a ministerial office over the past 10 years you ended up with less of an amount of money to do more.” He served previously as a minister of State from 2016 to 2017 and again from 2018 to 2020 as a member of the Independent Alliance. A county councillor from 2004 to 2015 including a year as mayor of Galway, he has also served on a number of boards and committees. Waterford TD Mary Butler (58) becomes the Government’s Chief Whip. From Portlaw, she ran a family grocery business for 17 years in the town. She served as a local councillor from 2014 until her first election to the Dáil in 2016. When in opposition she was junior spokeswoman for older people and chair of an Oireachtas cross-party group on dementia. She opposed the legalisation of abortion in the 2018 referendum. In the same year she introduced a private member’s Bill to ban tattoos and intimate piercings for people under the age of 18. As minister for older people she introduced a range of legislation including safeguarding measures and expressed concern that families might be incentivised to put elderly relatives into care when minister for housing Darragh O’Brien proposed to allow tax-free rental of the homes of relatives in nursing homes. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We came across a bullish thesis on The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE) on Twitter by EagleFangCapital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on PLCE. The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE)'s share was trading at $10.17 as of Jan 22nd. PLCE’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.61 and 8.54 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A young boy happily shopping in a children's apparel retail store. In its most recent quarter, PLCE reported $455 million in sales, a 3.4% increase quarter-to-date driven by strong wholesale performance, and is projected to end the quarter flattish with sales between $450-460 million. Gross margin is expected to improve significantly, with an anticipated 30% GM, a sharp recovery from last year's 21.7% disaster, as the company has been running closer to 35% throughout the year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SGA) are forecasted at $100 million, similar to Q3 levels, translating to EBITDA of $35-38 million, compared to $44.5 million in Q3 and $23 million in the seasonally weaker Q2. While the calendar shift affected Q3, there could be lower sales but higher gross margin in Q4, bringing EBITDA close to the Q3 figures. With $100 million+ of EBITDA over the first nine months and an improved Q4, a baseline of $125-130 million for the year seems achievable. The company's capital expenditure is expected to be around $25 million, and with interest expense starting to decrease, a path toward generating real free cash flow and reducing debt begins to take shape in the coming year. Even if free cash flow per share comes in at $3 instead of $5 due to the rights offering, the current $10 share price appears significantly undervalued, making it an attractive opportunity moving forward. The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 9 hedge fund portfolios held PLCE at the end of the third quarter which was 13 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of PLCE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLCE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) on Long-Term Pick’s Substack by Dan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MPWR. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR)'s share was trading at $689.42 as of Jan 22nd. MPWR’s trailing and forward P/E were 77.72 and 39.68 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. An automated manufacturing production line of semiconductor components on an assembly line. Monolithic Power Systems (MPS) is a leading semiconductor company specializing in power-efficient solutions across a wide range of industries, including data centers, automotive, industrial automation, and consumer electronics. Founded in 1997, the company is known for its innovative analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, which are essential for technological transitions in key sectors such as electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure, and AI-powered data centers. With a strong focus on design and innovation, MPS operates as a fabless company, outsourcing its manufacturing while maintaining high flexibility and reducing fixed costs. This business model allows MPS to leverage its proprietary process technologies to enhance efficiency and deliver high returns on invested capital (ROIC). MPS is strategically positioned to benefit from the rapid growth in high-tech sectors, with the automotive and data center markets being primary drivers of its long-term growth. The automotive segment is experiencing an expansion due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and advanced driver-assist systems, while the data center segment is benefiting from the rising demand for AI workloads and cloud computing technologies. These sectors are expected to fuel MPS's growth, with the company projected to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of at least 20% through 2030. MPS is expected to see its earnings per share (EPS) grow at a rate of 20.6% annually, with sales projected to increase by 18.8% through fiscal 2026. Despite its strong growth potential, MPS recently faced challenges, including a loss of market share related to Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU platform. Performance issues with its voltage regulator modules (VRMs) led to reduced allocations and canceled orders, causing the stock to drop nearly 20%. However, the company’s leadership remains confident in the future of MPS, particularly in the AI-driven server market, which is expected to stabilize and grow in the coming years. MPS's competitive edge is anchored in its proprietary BCD technology, which integrates analog, digital, and memory components into a single chip, delivering higher power density and greater efficiency than competitors. The company’s fabless model further enhances its cost structure, making it a key player in its industry. MPS's diverse customer base includes major companies in computing, automotive, and cloud computing, reinforcing its integral role in global supply chains. MPS is well-positioned for continued growth with a strong balance sheet, including $1.46 billion in cash and no debt. However, risks remain, including potential geopolitical concerns and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Despite these risks, MPS is widely viewed as undervalued, with a discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of the stock to be $715.78, suggesting a 12.6% upside. This makes MPS an attractive investment for those seeking exposure to high-growth sectors such as electric vehicles and AI-driven data centers. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (MPWR) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 38 hedge fund portfolios held MPWR at the end of the third quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of MPWR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MPWR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Dogecoin ETFs Will Skyrocket Price To $15, Forecasts Analyst
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-etfs-will-skyrocket-price-to-15/
Time Published: 2025-01-23T18:00:21Z
Full Content:
Following Bitwise’s and Rex Shares’ recent application for spot Dogecoin ETFs in the United States, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided a technical outlook suggesting Dogecoin (DOGE) could ascend to $15. His analysis, detailed in a logarithmic chart spanning from 2017 to 2025, captures a massive ascending channel that highlights the potential upward trajectory for DOGE. Martinez’s chart delineates a long-term ascending channel where Dogecoin’s price action is bounded by a structure consisting of three parallel trendlines. The lowest of these lines has consistently served as a firm support since 2017, aiding the price to stabilize during significant downturns, notably in early 2019 and again in mid-2022. The median line of the channel, which presently hovers around $0.40 to $0.45, has just been tested by DOGE as it recently surged to this level, marking a critical inflection point that was last touched in early 2022. The upper boundary of the channel, which is the focus of Martinez’s bullish forecast, is projected to climb well above $10, touching as high as $15 by late 2025. This top trendline is not just a theoretical limit but has proven to be the bull run top twice for the Dogecoin price, once in January 2018 and then in May 2021. At the last all-time high in May 2021, Doge even significantly exceeded the channel. Martinez’s prediction highlights the spot Dogecoin ETFs as potential market catalysts. He suggests that the approval and launch of such financial products could channel fresh institutional and retail investment into DOGE, propelling it towards these higher valuations. In trading terms, the current position of DOGE below the median line is pivotal. This price level has historically acted as a springboard for upward movement when sustained buying pressure is present. Should DOGE maintain its footing above this zone, the pathway to higher resistance levels around $1.00, and potentially the channel’s upper echelon near $15, appears technically feasible. Notably, the spot Doge ETFs could hit the market as early as April, according to Bloomberg’s ETF specialist Eric Balchunas. Bitwise officially lodged the application to register a Dogecoin ETF on Wednesday. The company submitted its proposal, named the “Bitwise Dogecoin ETF,” to the Delaware Division of Corporations, which is part of the U.S. Department of State. Although such registrations can occasionally be misleading, Balchunas confirmed via X: “Bitwise Doge ETF likely coming soon.. and yes I checked and this is def legit (vs some whack job committing forgery for a quick pump a la BlackRock XRP that one time).” Registering in Delaware represents an initial step before advancing to a formal ETF submission with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This registration process sets up the legal structure that would manage the proposed ETF but does not constitute a direct application for SEC approval. This initiative follows an earlier application by investment firms Rex Shares and Osprey Funds, both of which have also filed applications for multiple cryptocurrency ETFs, including one focused on Dogecoin. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.34. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: Best Crypto Presales to Buy Now for 100x — Larry Fink’s $700K Bitcoin Prediction
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-presales-to-buy-now-for-100x-larry-fink-700k-bitcoin-prediction/

BlackRock, one of the biggest investment companies in the world, has given crypto enthusiasts a new reason to be excited. Its CEO, Larry Fink, has said that Bitcoin can be expected to make huge price moves, potentially reaching the $700K mark soon. The BlackRock CEO explained how political and economic instability is acting as a catalyst for Bitcoin, which serves as an internationally recognized currency free from any local fears. What’s more, Bitcoin is still holding steady above $104K, with a 12% uptick in the last month. With all the signs looking positive for BTC, and keeping in mind that the overall crypto market follows Bitcoin’s footprints, now is one of the best times to be a crypto investor. To help you out, here are 5 crypto presales that can offer up to a 100x return. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has undoubtedly been one of the best crypto presale performances to date. Launched just over a month ago, $WEPE’s presale has already raised over $57.5M, with both retailers and whales gobbling it up at a breakneck pace. The presale ends in 24 days, so this could be your last chance to grab one of the best meme coins. What makes Wall Street Pepe stand out is its personal vendetta against crypto whales, who have been abusing insider information to manipulate the crypto market and feast on innocent retailers. The project aims to eliminate this lopsidedness by creating a frog army of retail investors and providing them with unique market insights, trading strategies, and real-time alpha calls. If you, too, want to beat the market and become a profitable crypto investor, join the $WEPE army for just $0.0003665 per token. For more, here’s how to buy $WEPE. Solaxy ($SOLX) has been created to unlock the full potential of Solana, which currently struggles with issues like network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. Solaxy has set aside a healthy 30% of its total token supply to resolve these issues. After raising $350K in the first 24 hours, the $SOLX presale is still going strong, with the total presale purse reaching over $13M. Don’t miss out on one of the next 100x meme coins, and get some for only $0.001612 each. Here’s a guide on how to buy $SOLX. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a self-sovereign AI agent with the ability to adapt and form his own opinions, as well as drive conversations and trends on dApps and online platforms such as X. $MIND uses hive-mind analysis to identify market trends before anybody else. He’ll then share his insights and access to new investment opportunities on his X and Telegram channels, giving token holders a real edge in the market. You can grab the best AI agent coin for just $0.0031762 if you get in now — here’s how to buy $MIND. Prices increase in the next 11 hours, so interested investors should hurry up. $RXS is the native currency of Rexas Finance, an interesting crypto project that’s tokenizing real-world assets, such as real estate, gold, art, and commodities. The biggest benefit of this platform is that it simplifies investments. Investing in gold and other precious metals, for instance, will no longer be difficult and will involve just a few clicks. Plus, token holders will get to participate in fractional ownership. For example, let’s say there’s a massive mansion spread across multiple acres of land, and you don’t have enough funds to buy it all by yourself. In that case, you can use Rexas to own a fraction of the property for a fraction of the price. Speaking of $RXS’s presale, it’s coming to an end, meaning prices aren’t as low as they were, say, a couple of months ago. However, they’re still the lowest you’ll ever get them for. Each token is priced at $0.200, with the total presale funding at $43M so far. Out of the 500,000,000 total token supply, 434,925,318 have already been sold. $LHUNT is the official token of the LuckHunter online casino. The platform itself is like any other: you can play casino games, bet, and win. However, what makes it unique is it lets you create a metaverse of your own digital casinos that you can rent. These casinos will be based in different cities, Las Vexus and Utlantic City (modeled after the real Las Vegas and Atlantic City), and you can lease the tables at your virtual casino for short-term or long-term profits. You can also customize the tables and ambiance and create your own gaming rules. What’s more, you can even host VIP events involving high-stakes games and special tournaments to earn luxurious rewards. 1 $LHUNT is currently available for $0.00138, but the price will increase by 10.5% as it enters the next stage of presale in just a couple of hours from now. Having already raised $1.1M in its ongoing presale, $LHUNT’s official website mentions that its potential listing price will be $0.005, which is more than 260% of the current price. While there’s little doubt that the above-mentioned crypto presales can go to the moon in 2025, it’s important to mix caution with chaos and only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. There will be ups and downs, so make sure you do enough cardio to prepare your heart! Also, none of the above is financial advice, and we highly recommend doing your own research (DYOR) before investing.

Title: USDC supply hits $2B – Are investors being cautious around Bitcoin?

Investor risk appetite is shrinking, driving up demand for USDC. Is it time to pull back? Are investors pulling back in the New Year? USD Coin [USDC] supply has surged to $2 billion – its highest in 707 days, while the global crypto market cap falls 3.49%. History hints at a pullback, but with the current volatility, could a crash be looming instead? Trump’s inauguration is behind us, the SEC has approved its first crypto regulation, and Bitcoin is still 6.18% below its $109K all-time high. No doubt, this week’s volatility has investors divided – some are pulling back, while others are HODLing strong, leaving BTC caught in a tug-of-war. The good news? BTC is holding above $100K, a level that’s sparked rebounds recently. In the last two weeks, BTC has dropped to this level three times, each time triggering an increase in outflows. Looks like investors are seeing this as a dip to buy. However, Bitcoin is just 3.54% above its weekly gains that pushed it past $109K. If those gains slip, BTC could fall to $98.4K. Adding to the caution, USDC supply has spiked to a two-year high. In just three days, USDC across exchanges dropped 17.21%, with Binance seeing an 18% decline. The jump in USDC supply to $2 billion from just $303K the previous day isn’t a fluke – investors are clearly playing it safe. Source: CryptoQuant As more investors move to USDC or cash out after realizing profits, the pressure to absorb this liquidity now falls on institutions. MicroStrategy is doing its part, having already made two purchases totaling 3,600 BTC this month alone. And it doesn’t stop there. BlackRock just made their largest Bitcoin buy of the year – $600 million worth of BTC. Could this be a sign of more institutional buying ahead that could stabilize the market? Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, ETFs are seeing steady inflows, keeping BTC above $100K with institutional support. However, the decline in greed signals a shrinking risk appetite, with investors flocking to stablecoins like USDC instead of Bitcoin. The debate over Bitcoin as a ‘safe haven’ is clearly intensifying. In fact, $818 million worth of Tether USD (ERC20) coins moved off exchanges just a day before Trump’s swearing-in ceremony – the largest outflow in a year. Source: CryptoQuant Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 With Trump’s radical policies already grabbing headlines, it’s no surprise investors are exercising caution. Now, with stability in question, the focus is on which asset will dominate – stablecoins or Bitcoin. For now, stablecoins seem to have the upper hand, but the battle is far from over.

Title: Why EA Stock Is Diving Today

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Video game maker Electronic Arts (EA) is plummeting 17% after the company reported lower-than-expected bookings for its fiscal third quarter that ended in December. EA also cut its full-year bookings guidance for its current fiscal year. EA blamed the bad news primarily on the subpar performance of its new soccer game, EA Sports FC 2025. A Look at EA's Results and Guidance The firm generated Q3 bookings of $2.22 billion last quarter, below its prior outlook of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion. Moreover, the video game maker now expects its bookings for its current full fiscal year to come in at $7 billion to $7.15 billion, versus its previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Also importantly, EA is predicting that its bookings obtained after game purchases will fall by about 5% during its current fiscal year. It had previously predicted that this metric would climb by about 5%. The company's latest soccer game, EA Sports FC 25 "underperformed our net bookings expectations,” CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement. After reviews of the game were underwhelming following its release last September, the revenue generated by the company's soccer games is expected to drop this quarter versus the same period a year earlier. The Recent Price Action of EA Stock In the last month, the shares have sunk 21.5%, while they have slumped 19% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of EA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
