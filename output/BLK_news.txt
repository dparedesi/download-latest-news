Title: Quantum Threat? BlackRock Flags Future Risk In Bitcoin ETF Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-threat-blackrock-flags-future-risk-in-bitcoin-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T15:00:28Z

BlackRock has added a warning about quantum computing to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing. Based on reports, the asset manager sees a future risk that ultra-powerful machines might crack the math securing Bitcoin. This is the first time BlackRock has flagged this concern in its spot Bitcoin ETF paperwork. According to the updated regulatory filing on May 9, BlackRock now lists “quantum computing” among possible threats to its Bitcoin ETF. The trust holds about $64 billion in net assets, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund on record. Company lawyers say that if quantum processors become strong enough, they could decrypt private keys and put wallet security in jeopardy. It’s a standard move in ETF filings to note every conceivable risk, even if it feels far-off. Based on reports, worries kicked up last December when Google unveiled Willow, a chip claimed to solve certain tasks in minutes that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years. A few months later, Microsoft introduced Majorana 1 to tackle long-standing scaling hurdles. Those announcements set off alarm bells in the crypto world. In theory, a quantum device running Shor’s algorithm could factor the large numbers behind Bitcoin’s elliptic-curve signatures. In practice, we’re still in the early, error-prone “NISQ” era, so real attacks remain at least years away. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, surfaced another angle in February. He suggested that once quantum hackers can break old private keys, they might recover Bitcoin from the roughly 3.7 million coins considered lost forever. Ardoino stressed that quantum machines are still distant from cracking 256-bit security, so no coins will reappear anytime soon. Crypto analyst Willy Woo jumped in, asking whether Google, a government agency, or a new startup would be first to seize those dormant assets. He figures the $350 billion in lost coins could spur fresh quantum investment if those keys ever become vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more cash than ever. Data from Farside Investors shows over $41 billion in net inflows since these funds launched in January. On May 8, weekly ETF inflows topped the previous all-time high of $40 billion. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called lifetime net flows “the hardest metric to grow,” yet ETFs raced to new highs despite recent market jitters. Investors appear focused on price moves today, not on the quantum questions of tomorrow. In the months ahead, crypto developers and standards groups will work on “post-quantum” signature schemes. If they stay on schedule, Bitcoin networks could adopt new, quantum-resistant algorithms long before any real threat appears. For now, the market’s heavy inflows suggest that mainstream buyers aren’t yet spooked by next-generation computing power.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as VanEck Launches US Treasury Fund Tokens on Ethereum and Solana

Proving there’s never a dull moment in the crypto market, yet another US asset manager – VanEck – is embracing the digital-assets era by launching a tokenized US Treasury fund. That’s good news for the traditional and crypto finance worlds, as well as the next crypto to explode. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL) is a blockchain-based investment vehicle that provides digital access to short-term US government bonds. So whereas those bonds were traditionally accessed through banks and brokers, qualified investors can now access them with stablecoins, like $USDC. By the way, by ‘qualified,’ we mean large. VBILL requires a minimum investment of $1M on Ethereum, and $100K on the other blockchains it’s available on. Those include Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche networks. VanEck is no newcomer to the crypto scene – it already issues spot $BTC and $ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes). And now it’s following the lead of BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and other firms by tokenizing traditional assets. In another positive move for crypto, cross-border banking giant Standard Charter is also increasing its crypto activity. Standard Charter is now collaborating with digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, which will integrate the bank’s forex services and infrastructure to provide its institutional clients with a broader range of offerings. This comes after the recent announcement of a partnership with OKX that enables institutional clients to use crypto as collateral. According to a Standard Global press release, the collaboration ‘continues FalconX’s efforts to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets with enterprise-grade infrastructure’. As digital assets are increasingly embraced by the traditional finance sector worldwide, it’s great news for the crypto market – and investors. With the Bitcoin price back up above the $100K mark, the market is looking bullish. And what’s good for the $BTC is generally good for other tokens. If you’re looking to invest in what could be the next crypto to explode, here are options well worth considering – including the best presale tokens of the year. The Solana blockchain is second only to Ethereum in terms of market dominance and the number of tokens. It’s fast and has relatively low transaction costs. But Solana is also plagued by network congestion and failed transactions. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) steps up to the plate. This meme coin is introducing the first-ever Layer-2 Solana platform – and that’s a big deal in the crypto world. Solaxy is building on Solana’s strong points (speed, low costs) and adding to it. The $SOLX project has solid tokenomics, with 30% allocated to development. That will be an important aspect of its long-term success. It’s also why $SOLX could be the next crypto to explode. Investor interest has so far been impressive. This is one of the best meme coins on presale – it has already raised $35.5M in funding. We expect big things to come from Solaxy after the presale ends and it lists on DEXs and CEXs. And that means there’s no better time to invest in $SOLX, with its current presale price of $0.001724 and 113% staking rewards. Take a look at our complete guide to buying in Solaxy – as well as our $SOLX price prediction – to find out how to make the most of what has the potential to be the next crypto to explode. In another crypto first, enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the one and only meme coin that tracks Bitcoin’s price. And when that price reaches a milestone, $BTCBULL holders will be airdropped $BTC as a reward. Considering $BTC’s recent bull run, there’s little reason not to expect its price to hit the $150K, $200K, and onwards to $1M in the not-too-distant future. It’s exactly at those milestones that holders of $BTCBULL will receive their own $BTC in the Best Wallet app. The $BTC rewards will be airdropped each time the price grows by $50K. And in-between – at $125K, $175K, and $225K thresholds – $BTCBULL tokens will be burned, adding to the scarcity (and potentially the value) of the token. If you’re keen to ride the $BTC bull run, you may find our full guide to buying the Bitcoin Bull Token helpful. It explains how to buy this top new crypto token – $BTCBULL – at its current price of $0.00251, with 72% APY staking. ChainGPT ($CGPT) is the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem. This Web3 platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide AI-powered tools that pretty much anyone can use – individuals or businesses – without having advanced technical knowledge. Among the ChainGPT AI offerings are a smart contract generator and auditor; NFT generator; trading assistant; Web3 chatbot; and a tool that enables you to build an AI agent (like MIND of Pepe, for instance) without coding. All those features are powered by $CGPT token. $CGPT holders also have voting rights in decision-making. And with growing adoption of crypto as a legitimate asset, this may well mean the $CGPT is among the best altcoins – and the next crypto to explode. Unlike $SOLX and $BTCBULL, $CGPT is not on presale. It is currently listed on both CEXs (including Binance, ByBit, MEXC, and KuCoin) and DEXs – PancakeSwap and Uniswap. One $CGPT currently costs $0.141, making it an affordable investment with potentially explosive gains. Touch wood, but things appear to be looking up for the crypto market. That sentiment is clear with the likes of the VanEck Treasury Fund being launched, and Standard Global partnering with FalconX. A recovery in the Bitcoin price also signals light on the horizon. And with that, the next crypto with the potential to explode – Solaxy, BTC Bull Token, and ChainGPT among them – may mean highly impressive gains.

Title: Why Catalytic Capital Needs a Better Definition (Blog)

The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. By Savannah Baum, Olivia Rosen, Sean Sellers & Billy Silk May 14, 2025 On the heels of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards exploded onto the scene as a way for companies to focus on sustainability in business decisions and for investors to prioritize socially responsible companies. In the years that followed, trillions of dollars poured into ESG funds. But cracks started to emerge. As journalists looked under the hood of ESG funds, they found investments in oil and gas majors. In 2021, Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, penned a scathing essay that the ESG label was being used to dupe the American public with greenwashing. Backlash against the consideration of social factors in investments also began to grow; in recent years, 19 US states have passed 42 anti-ESG laws preventing public fund managers from taking social considerations into account. At its core, ESG’s problem stems from a lack of clarity. There are, of course, innumerable instances of ESG-focused funds leading important change globally. Many have helped reform operational and governance standards within corporations, and forced internal dialogue and measurement efforts to gauge social progress. But in the absence of clear, value-based standards, it’s often just a buzzword. Its loosely defined, “yes and” posture allows companies and investors to toss it around to validate their commitment to social good without having to meet specific requirements. Companies’ loquacious race to classify themselves as “ESG-approved” has led to justified attack, with shareholder support for ESG declining and institutional investors citing ESG fatigue. The ESG movement may be too far gone to revive. But its fate can help shape the development of another type of impact financing: catalytic capital. A sharper, shared understanding of this form of risk-tolerant investment, which takes on risk to validate a new business model or market with the aim of ultimately drawing in more capital, can dramatically increase the volume and scope of funding for social impact. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. To scale promising social enterprises, leaders of social change need access to context-appropriate capital—funding that considers and addresses the unique risks and needs (such as limited liquidity and longer timelines) that ventures in challenging markets face. This type of investment is widely known as catalytic capital and is remarkably good at market building. According to Convergence, every $1 of catalytic capital mobilizes $4 of downstream traditional investment for social impact efforts. A compelling example is FarmWorks, a social enterprise that provides farming inputs, finance, training, and market access to smallholder farmers in Kenya. In 2020, the company’s co-founders Yi Li and Peter Muthee began looking for investors who understood the unique needs of building an agricultural business in the region. FarmWorks’ business model was fundamentally different than the high-margin software businesses typically favored by venture capital. As Li explains, "To sell a kilo of tomatoes, you're growing another kilo of tomatoes," underscoring the methodical nature of agricultural scaling compared to typical venture-backed businesses. Building FarmWorks also meant developing extensive logistics networks, managing relationships with thousands of farmers, and operating warehouses across the region. Like many social ventures in emerging economies, the company also faced limited supply and payment infrastructure, complex distribution channels, and customers with constrained purchasing power. Its path to profitability would be longer, and its exit strategy less defined than what traditional investors typically sought. As Li told us, "For businesses like FarmWorks that are not disrupting a model but are significantly improving the efficiency and scale of possibility [in] a traditional sector, patience is required.” In 2021, Acumen’s Resilient Agriculture Fund stepped in to provide pre-seed, patient capital, a form of catalytic capital geared toward longer horizons. This allowed the team to honor their ambitious mission sustainably without short-sighted pressures of quick exits and high returns. The company used initial funding to grow its services into an integrated suite of end-to-end support, including financing for low-cost machinery and reliable access to markets, and became the largest domestic distributor of fresh vegetables in Kenya within four years. Today, it works with 3,000 farmers to bring produce to market, and sells more than 1,000 tons of local staples and high-value crops monthly. A recent $4.1 million, pre-series A funding round—led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund and supported by Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, family offices, and angel investors—signaled confidence in both the company’s market opportunity and ability to scale systems-level impact. Estimates vary, but proxies suggest that catalytic capital constitutes less than 0.01 percent of global investment capital. And while the impact investing market has grown to approximately $1.1 trillion, only a fraction of this sum can be considered catalytic capital. This scarcity of flexible funding for early-stage social ventures that are working in challenging but promising markets isn't just about numbers; it represents a tremendous amount of transformative impact left unrealized. On the surface, the definition of catalytic capital may seem clear: flexible financing for impact ventures that investors can tailor to take on unique risks. But go a level deeper, and questions proliferate. What kinds of risk? What kinds of financing? Different organizations perceive catalytic capital differently. For example, some emphasize concessionary returns that trade lower financial gains for social impact, some focus on taking on greater market risk, and some aim to benefit specific groups of people. Some argue that any concessionary instrument (including a loan or a grant) qualifies, while others insist that the investment must pull more traditional financiers into these markets via blended transactions or follow-on investments. During our time as MBA candidates pursuing social impact research, we’ve spoken with many investors and professors experienced with catalytic capital who believe some definitional flexibility is good. Rather than gatekeeping on semantics, they believe maintaining some openness to different forms of catalytic capital helps bring more investors into the market. We don’t necessarily disagree. But they also recognize the downsides of ambiguity. Inconsistent definitions present a number of problems. For example, it’s time-consuming and challenging for social entrepreneurs to look across the wide range of impact capital providers to identify who might be the right investor for their unique needs. Catalytic investors meanwhile struggle to collaborate on deal flow to solve market gaps, and follow-on or commercial co-investors struggle to compare deals side-by-side. The result is an inefficient catalytic capital market with limited impact. Delineating catalytic capital by the mechanisms through which it operates, however, can improve everyone’s understanding, more efficiently match market needs with particular investor flexibilities, and ultimately scale more impact through greater capital flows. For example, a biotech startup developing a maternal health diagnostic may need highly flexible, long-term capital due to high R&D costs, regulatory hurdles, and a delayed path to revenue. This would make it better suited to non-concessionary patient capital. In contrast, a community-owned broadband provider serving rural areas might achieve steady revenue relatively quickly through subscriber fees but operate with intentionally limited margins to keep services affordable. While it can generate cash flow, its social mission caps its returns. This makes it a better fit for concessionary capital that prioritizes impact over market-rate returns. Both models create meaningful impact but require different capital structures to thrive. Catalytic capital is intended to “go first”—derisking an asset or market with the goal of attracting additional investments, often from conventional investors who wouldn’t otherwise participate. It’s thus important to ensure that conventional investors can compare deals apples-to-apples—including elements like impact metrics, mobilization goals, or market forecasts—so that they don’t walk away from the market altogether. As noted earlier, investors aren’t monolithic. Catalytic and commercial investors have unique preferences; their motivations, risk appetites, and returns expectations differ. One catalytic investor may be willing to seek concessionary returns on loans, while another might sacrifice on return horizons. Co-investors are similarly diverse; what makes an investment too risky for one commercial lender will differ from another. And certainly, investee needs vary widely. In addition, while many impact investors do great work determining the needs of specific markets to close financing gaps, they often do so in silos. No coordinating body actively tracks and shares financing gaps across markets or maps where specific investors are most willing to take on specific risks. Given this, a lot of great deals that aren’t a fit for one investor likely die when a better-suited capital provider might have carried them forward. Clearer definitions can address these market failures in several ways. For one, they reduce transaction friction for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are too often left in the dark, unable to determine which capital stacks and investors best match their business needs. Better definitions for the type of risks individual catalytic investors are willing to take on equips entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to find the right investors. In addition, they improve market efficiency by better matching capital to opportunity. Although the motivations and capabilities of catalytic investors vary widely, they often cluster around similar opportunities while leaving other needs unmet. More clearly distinguishing the different dimensions of catalytic capital can help them identify the right fit. Clearer definitions also enable better investor coordination. When investors can clearly articulate their risk appetites and preferred impact dimensions, they can more effectively combine forces. They help align traditional investors with relevant catalytic investors who have the right tools to sufficiently de-risk specific areas of concern. Given this opportunity to create a more robust and responsive impact capital market, we propose a new framework for defining catalytic capital that has two parts: requisite properties and dynamic attributes. We do not propose this framework with the expectation that it answers every ambiguous question around catalytic capital, or even that this is the “right” set of guardrails for all catalytic market participants. We hope this framework can serve as a starting point for discussion on the anatomy and gradient of catalytic investments, with both traditional and non-traditional dimensions. It also aims to strike a balance between rigor, clarity, and flexibility. The first part, requisite properties, offers a baseline understanding of what catalytic capital “must be and do,” and includes three criteria: The second part of the framework then proposes that catalytic capital must be dynamic in at least one of five (but usually more) specific attributes: An investment does not need to fall in the leftmost box of every dimension in the chart to be catalytic. Indeed, many catalytic investments incorporate more traditional features across several dimensions. For example, investors might consider an investment that deviates meaningfully from at least one standard commercial norm (the chart’s rightmost boxes) somewhat catalytic. A debt instrument with conventional liquidity and a standard return timeline might offer concessionary returns and take a first-loss position in the capital stack (the order in which investors are repaid if the company defaults) if the investee defaults. Investors might also consider an investment that is non-concessionary but allows abnormally long timelines for return catalytic. For example, an investor in carbon projects might demand strong returns (say, a 15 percent internal rate of return) but allow investees to repay them over 15-20 years instead of the more traditional 8-10 years. Understanding where an investment falls within this taxonomy enables more effective market engagement, offering a shared language and clearer perspective on what type of catalytic capital is and is not being deployed. In the absence of widely adopted, data-driven approaches or logic-tested theories of change, investor commitment to ESG has proven fleeting. Better definitions and specific language can help catalytic capital avoid the same fate, and provide a more reasoned commitment to market development and systemic change. The framework presented here is not an exercise in dogmatism, attempting to set forth rigid definitions that limit participation. It is an attempt to support the discipline and rigor of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors in pursuit of more effective collaboration. Incremental changes, driven by clearer frameworks and objective standards, will ultimately lead to much greater impact than chasing buzzwords or hype. More stories like that of FarmWorks are waiting to be written, and their chapters can unfold when visionary entrepreneurs align with the right investors and timing. Some may want ambiguity to persist in the name of inclusion, but allowing anyone to call their capital catalytic risks a more troubling exclusion: holding communities back from building and sharing a more prosperous future. Developing a shared understanding in service of better coordination is an important next step in the field’s evolution. Support SSIR’s coverage of cross-sector solutions to global challenges.

BREAKING: Supreme Court skeptical about Trump’s plan to limit birthright citizenship Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump offers an optimistic vision of relations with countries in the Middle East. The Supreme Court’s upcoming hearing on birthright citizenship will tackle the power of lower courts. And the Menendez brothers were resentenced in their parents’ 1989 killings. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump spoke of a future for the Middle East steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances as he announced the U.S. would end sanctions against war-torn Syria and signed a $600 billion investment agreement with Saudi Arabia in his first visit to the region since his second term began. He also offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development. Applause followed Trump’s promise to withdraw sanctions in Syria. But in announcing his “fervent wish” that Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords, the diplomatic agreements Trump’s first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations, the president drew silence from the room. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which has reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S. includes $20 billion in AI data centers and other technologies, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries, according to a White House statement. Also in attendance at yesterday’s ceremonial events were Sam Altman of Open AI, Palantir CEO Alex Carp, billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of companies like Amazon and Coca-Cola, to pitch Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Elon Musk was also present. Trump’s rhetoric and vision of a prosperous future with the region contrasted the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed Saudi Arabia “a pariah” before taking office. And while rejecting the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders’ morals, he swiped at destructive forces in the region, calling out Iran for causing “unthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond.” Today, Trump met with Syria's new president in a major breakthrough for the former jihadi commander. Read the full story here. Also looming over Trump’s visit this week is Qatar’s proposed gift of a luxury plane to be used as a new Air Force One for the president. Trump has said he would accept it. However, aviation experts said converting the 747 jet would cost over $1 billion and might not be completed by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. The jet would have to be dismantled, part by part, to ensure there were no listening devices or other vulnerabilities, and then fitted with sophisticated systems for secure government communications. That’s not all. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments tomorrow over President Donald Trump’s plan to end birthright citizenship, but the court is not actually using the cases before it to give the final word on whether Trump can reinterpret the long-understood meaning of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. Instead, it will focus on the question of whether lower-court judges have the authority to block the policy nationwide. The Trump administration is asking the court to limit the scope of the birthright citizenship injunctions so that they apply only to individual people, organizations that sued or potentially the 22 states that challenged Trump’s executive order. In recent months, his administration and allies have raged at judges for issuing “universal injunctions” concerning birthright citizenship and other policies which a DOJ official characterized as a “direct attack” on presidential power. While broad injunctions have also been used against former Presidents Joe Biden (18 during his term) and Barack Obama (19 during his two terms), Trump, who saw 86 injunctions during his first term, has sought to use executive power to circumvent Congress more than his predecessors. Five of the six members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority have, in various cases, raised concerns about universal injunctions and suggested they should be curbed in certain circumstances. Read the full story here. R&B singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, took the stand on the second day of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ federal sex trafficking trial, detailing years of alleged abuse by the music mogul. Ventura is the prosecution’s star witness, and her 2023 lawsuit against Combs, which was settled privately one day after it was filed, became a framework for the government’s sprawling case against the music mogul. In her first day on the stand, Ventura, 38, gave graphic and emotional testimony of alleged physical abuse and control that included dayslong, drug-fueled sexual encounters with male escorts under Combs’ direction. She said she first participated in the “freak-offs” around 2008, when she was 22, and they continued while she dated Combs on and off before the pair split in 2018. The sex would occur in Combs’ homes, her homes and hotel suites around the world, and Ventura said they might find escorts off Craigslist, paying them between $1,500 and $6,000. Combs appeared to listen intently during the testimony. “I felt pretty horrible about myself,” Ventura said. “I felt disgusting. I felt humiliated.” Ventura, who first met Combs in 2005 when she was 19 and signed a 10-album deal with his Bad Boy label, also testified that her music career stalled when arranging “freak offs” for Combs “became a job.” She went on to say that angering Combs would result in physical and ongoing psychological abuse. Read more about Ventura’s testimony and her allegations against Combs. She’s expected to take the stand again today, and her testimony could last through the week.

After months of delays, opposition from Los Angeles County’s district attorney and a series of witnesses who advocated for them, Erik and Lyle Menendez are now eligible for parole in the 1989 killings of their parents at their Beverly Hills home. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said in a ruling yesterday that the brothers would be resentenced to 50 years to life, adding that he did not believe they posed an “unreasonable risk” if released. Now, a California parole board will weigh whether the men are suitable for release and is expected to submit its clemency recommendation next month to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The brothers, who have been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole, gave statements after yesterday’s ruling. Lyle said he made no excuses for killing his parents or for seeking to have people perjure themselves on his behalf. Erik echoed those comments. Read the full story here. I’ve always been fascinated with learning about Louisiana’s history and unique cultural stories. As someone who has done extensive family research myself in the state, it’s exciting to uncover unexpected connections. The process feels like a scavenger hunt. So when I started seeing chatter about Pope Leo XIV’s ties to New Orleans on social media, I connected with genealogist Alex DaPaul Lee, who has assisted me in previous archival searches for my reporting in Louisiana. He told me that he had discovered evidence of Leo’s ancestral roots, which show his Creole background through his great-great-grandmother, Celeste Lemelle. But historic documentation from Louisiana, as we saw while looking through the Lemelle family’s records, can reveal both the highs and lows of history: ownership, status, literacy, freedom and wealth, juxtaposed with racism, social class divides, slavery and discrimination. All of it adds spice and complexity to the perfect bowl of gumbo. The resulting story of Pope Leo’s lineage shines a light on our imperfect American history while bringing an extra layer of pride to people from Louisiana. — Maya Eaglin, NBC News correspondent Wondering how to treat scars and reduce their appearance?

Title: Merz woos Trump with invitation to German ancestral village

The chancellor appears to want to appeal to the American president’s German ancestry in order to improve frayed relations. BERLIN — Germany’s new chancellor has a plan for getting on U.S. President Donald Trump’s good side: appeal to his German ancestry. Friedrich Merz said he has invited Trump to the western German village where the president’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born and raised before emigrating to the United States at the age of 16 in 1885 “I’ve invited him to Germany, to visit his ancestral town,” Merz said at a business summit in Berlin. “I’ll go there with him.” It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take up Merz on the offer. Despite Trump’s frequent criticisms of Germany, a country he had repeatedly called “delinquent” on defense spending, the president has often highlighted his German roots. “I have German in my blood,” he said during a 2019 meeting with Angela Merkel as the then-chancellor reacted with a look of amusement at that phrasing. The invitation comes as Merz prepares for his first official trip to Washington as chancellor. Although it is unclear when the visit will take place, Merz has said it will happen “soon.” A former chairman of BlackRock Germany and longtime supporter of the transatlantic alliance, Merz has often said he would appeal to Trump’s love of making “deals” in order to strengthen frayed relations between the U.S. and Germany over an array of issues, from Ukraine to tariffs. Merz and Trump have spoken twice since the German election. Their most recent call took place during Merz’s recent visit to Kyiv along with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. It’s not clear whether Trump would be well received in Kallstadt, his grandfather’s birthplace. In 2016, ahead of his first term in office, many in the town told POLITICO they didn’t care for the then-presidential candidate. “We really don’t give a damn about Trump,” one resident said at the time. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.” Restoring conscription would mark a major policy shift. Officials say the group planned explosive parcel attacks to spread fear and destabilize the country. The group, which opposes Germany’s constitutional order, is headed by a self-appointed monarch calling himself “King Peter.” The former Bundestag president is poised to become co-leader of the SPD as it attempts a reboot after historic election losses.

Title: From Fringe to Foundation: Coinbase’s Debut Signals Crypto’s Coming of Age (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

For years, digital assets carried a whiff of skepticism in traditional finance circles – a perceived “taboo stain” that serious institutions were hesitant to touch. Many remembered the early days of Bitcoin’s wild price swings, high-profile exchange hacks, and regulators sounding alarms. Crypto companies struggled for mainstream respect; a large pension fund or bank wouldn’t want to be caught with a crypto exchange on its balance sheet. But Coinbase’s S&P 500 inclusion emphatically wipes away much of that historical stigma. It signals that crypto businesses have matured into credible, profitable enterprises worthy of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Fortune 500 stalwarts. Inclusion in the S&P isn’t arbitrary – a company must meet strict criteria for market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability and sustained profitability. By meeting those standards, Coinbase essentially earned a mainstream seal of approval, demonstrating that a company built on crypto can be as fundamentally sound as any in traditional finance. Just a few years ago, major indices and investors kept digital asset companies at arm’s length. Now we have Indices effectively declaring that at least one crypto firm has “made it” into the upper echelon of public companies. The symbolism is powerful. In practical terms, it means Wall Street’s perception of crypto has undergone a dramatic turnaround. What was once seen as a risky curiosity is now recognized as a permanent fixture. Legacy institutions – from investment funds to brokerage houses – are increasingly engaging with blockchain infrastructure, exploring digital custody solutions, and even trading tokenized assets. With Coinbase now in the same index as banks and tech giants, the message is clear: crypto and digital assets are now a credible part of global finance’s fabric, woven into indexes and portfolios worldwide. Moreover, Coinbase’s induction may pave the way for other digital asset firms to join major indices in the future. It’s a precedent that says crypto companies can graduate from the periphery to the very core of equity markets. The “taboo” has truly been, at least to a large degree, broken. Mainstream Milestones: Wall Street and Payment Giants Embrace Crypto Coinbase ’s S&P 500 debut isn’t happening in isolation. It caps off a series of milestones that have steadily blurred the line between traditional finance (TradFi) and the crypto world. Over the past two years, some of the biggest names in global finance and tech have made decisive moves to integrate digital assets into their offerings, further validating that crypto is here to stay. Consider just a few of these developments: Seriously, the examples are literally endless. I am picking a handful so as to not bore you, the reader to death, but you can read more of my thoughts regarding digital assets every Monday. Adapt or Be Left Behind: A Warning to the Skeptics The convergence of traditional finance and crypto is no longer speculative – it’s structural. And that carries a warning for any institutions still refusing to acknowledge crypto’s rise. In 2025, to ignore crypto is akin to ignoring the internet in 2000 – a recipe for irrelevance. The past year has shown a “join or miss out” dynamic: those who integrated digital assets reaped the benefits of new revenue streams, broader client bases, and improved tech infrastructure, while those who stayed on the sidelines watched innovation pass them by. Regulators and policymakers are also coming around (albeit cautiously), providing clearer frameworks that remove excuses for institutional inaction. With reputable players in the game and safeguards maturing, the barrier to entry for traditional institutions is lower than ever. Let me be clear: The taboo is gone. The credibility is proven. The demand is undeniable. This is no longer a game of maybe's. This is the new reality. Crypto is not an outsider anymore, but an integral part of the financial structure. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 is just the latest sign that the walls are down and a new, hybrid financial era is taking shape. The old skeptics have less and less to point to as justification for shunning digital assets. Final Thought If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em – or better yet, index them. Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 isn’t just a victory for one company – it’s a milestone for an entire industry. The bulls of Wall Street and the bulls of crypto are finally running in the same direction. And those still waiting for crypto to “go away” might want to check the index — it’s already here.

Title: VanEck to compete with BlackRock in tokenized US Treasuries race, launching on Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Avalanche

VanEck’s VBILL fund marks a new era for qualified investors with strategic multi-chain deployment and stablecoin integration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Traditional finance heavyweight VanEck has entered the real-world asset (RWA) arena with the launch of VBILL, a tokenized fund offering exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries across Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana. The fund marks a significant step in the institutionalization of tokenized finance, as asset managers race to offer blockchain-native, yield-generating alternatives to crypto-native treasuries. Structured as a BVI-domiciled fund, VBILL is managed by Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers, with Securitize acting as the placement agent. The fund is open to qualified investors only, with a $100,000 minimum investment across most supported chains and a $1 million minimum on Ethereum. Under the hood, the fund holds U.S. Treasury bills, custodied by State Street Bank & Trust, with on-chain NAV data supplied daily via RedStone oracles. Subscriptions and redemptions occur via USDC, and token transfers across blockchains are made possible using the Wormhole protocol. VBILL also features atomic redemption into Agora’s AUSD stablecoin, allowing for frictionless liquidity pathways between yield and stablecoin markets. “By bringing U.S. Treasuries on-chain, we are providing investors with a secure, transparent, and liquid tool for cash management,” said Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck. VanEck’s move follows BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, launched in March 2024, which brought the world’s largest asset manager into the tokenization race. With VBILL, VanEck goes a step further by deploying across four chains from day one, a signal of growing confidence in cross-chain infrastructure. The tokenized T-bill sector has grown explosively, recently surpassing $6.8 billion in total value locked, a more than 5x increase year-over-year. VanEck’s launch appears to be both a strategic counter to BUIDL and an effort to offer more flexibility and composability to crypto-native treasury desks and stablecoin providers. Despite its blockchain-native architecture, VBILL is limited to accredited investors via exemptions under Regulation D and Rule 506(c). Retail participation remains out of reach, and the fund’s $100,000+ ticket size reinforces its institutional focus. While State Street custody provides traditional security guarantees, the product still inherits smart contract risk and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities. Key open questions remain around redemption queues and liquidity provisioning during market stress, especially for users accessing the fund across different blockchain environments. “This collaboration merges the best of Securitize’s tokenization model with VanEck’s expertise… demonstrating tokenization’s ability to create new market opportunities,” said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize. With BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and now VanEck diving into the RWA space, tokenized money-market products are quickly becoming a new battleground for traditional asset managers. Each is experimenting with different blends of on-chain transparency, liquidity access, and compliance guardrails to capture a growing pool of crypto-native capital seeking real-world yield.

Title: eToro locks in $4.2B valuation, tests IPO waters with Nasdaq listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/etoro-locks-in-4-2b-valuation-tests-ipo-waters-with-nasdaq-listing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T05:21:10Z

The stock brokerage and burgeoning crypto platform eToro is stepping into the Wall Street spotlight, having priced its initial public offering at $52 per share. This move signals the company’s readiness to gauge investor appetite for new listings in a market still finding its footing after a period of volatility. The Israel-based firm successfully raised nearly $310 million through the sale of almost 6 million shares, a transaction that pegs the company’s valuation at approximately $4.2 billion. This pricing lands above its initially targeted range of $46 to $50 per share. Alongside the company’s offering, existing investors are also divesting an additional tranche of nearly 6 million shares, further shaping the public float. The path to this moment has been paved with cautious optimism. The IPO market had shown signs of a potential resurgence earlier in the year, particularly following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, which some hoped would break a prolonged drought influenced by rising interest rates and persistent inflationary concerns. Indeed, CoreWeave’s successful March debut provided a glimmer of hope for other aspiring public companies, including eToro, online lending giant Klarna, and ticket reseller StubHub. However, this nascent recovery faced headwinds. “Tariff uncertainty temporarily stalled those plans,” the original article noted, capturing a period of market jitters. Consequently, eToro, which had filed for its IPO in March, alongside Klarna and StubHub, opted to shelve its immediate ambitions as markets grappled with the implications of trade policy shifts. Now, as eToro prepares for its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol ETOR, its performance may serve as a significant litmus test for the broader public market’s willingness to embrace risk. The IPO landscape is showing renewed activity; digital physical therapy company Hinge Health has commenced its IPO roadshow, revealing in a Tuesday filing its intention to raise up to $437 million. Also on Tuesday, fintech innovator Chime submitted its prospectus to the SEC, indicating its own public market aspirations. This follows the April move by another trading application, Webull, which went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Founded in 2007 by brothers Yoni and Ronen Assia along with David Ring, eToro operates in a competitive landscape, challenging established players like Robinhood. Its revenue model is built on fees tied to trading activities, such as spreads on buy and sell orders, and non-trading operations including withdrawals and currency conversions. The company’s financial trajectory has been notable, with net income soaring almost thirteenfold last year to $192.4 million, a substantial increase from $15.3 million the previous year. A significant driver of this growth has been its expanding crypto business. Revenue from cryptoassets more than tripled to exceed $12 million in 2024, and crypto-related activities accounted for a quarter of its net trading contribution last year, up sharply from 10% in the prior year. This isn’t eToro’s maiden voyage into the public offering process. “In 2022, the company scrapped plans to hit the market through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) during a sharp downturn in equity markets,” the source material highlighted. That earlier deal would have valued eToro at a considerably higher figure of more than $10 billion. Despite the previous setback, CEO Yoni Assia remained committed to a public listing. He told CNBC early last year that eToro was still aiming for a market debut but was “evaluating the right opportunity” while building relationships with exchanges, including the Nasdaq. “We definitely are eyeing the public markets,” Assia stated at the time. “I definitely see us becoming eventually a public company.” Adding a vote of confidence to the current offering, eToro disclosed in its prospectus that investment behemoth BlackRock had “expressed interest in buying $100 million in shares at the IPO price.” The company further detailed its plan to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives slated to sell an additional 5 million. The underwriting syndicate for this significant financial maneuver includes industry heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp praises Saudi engineers and takes a swipe at Europe, saying it has 'given up' on AI

At an investment forum in Riyadh, Alex Karp, CEO of defense tech company Palantir Technologies, praised Saudi engineers for meritocracy and patriotism — and took a swipe at Europe over its slow AI adoption. "You're seeing a receptivity in this region, especially in the kingdom," Karp said at the Saudi-US Investment Forum on Tuesday. "But the receptivity is on the back of people who have a deep tradition in engineering excellence and, quite frankly, believe in their own future." Karp was addressing a request from panel host and CNBC anchor Sara Eisen to expand upon a previous comment that the countries and regions that are best utilizing AI right now are the US and the Middle East. "Obviously, the great contradistinction here is Europe, where, you know, it's like people have given up, and we — I really hope that turns around in Europe," he added. The talk came as President Donald Trump received a royal welcome with golden chairs and Arabian horses in Riyadh on Tuesday as he kicked off his Gulf tour. Flanked by executives from Google, Nvidia, BlackRock, and others to discuss AI, defense, and energy with Saudi officials, Trump said he aims to secure $1 trillion in deals. Based on an October 2024 report published by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, European organizations lag behind their US counterparts by 45 to 70% in terms of AI adoption. And while Europe leads in producing AI semiconductor equipment — machinery and tools used to make semiconductors — the report said that Europe has below 5% market share in areas like raw materials, cloud infrastructure, and supercomputers. "Opportunity remains wide open, but Europe is starting from a disadvantage," the report QuantumBlack wrote. Europe is also known for much more stringent AI regulations. On August 1, 2024, Europe enacted the AI Act, the first-ever legal framework on AI, and established an AI office to oversee the implementation of these regulations. The AI Act is just one part of a wider package of measures that the EU said ensures "trustworthy AI," which explicitly banned practices such as AI-based manipulation and deception, real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in public spaces, and individual criminal offense risk assessment. According to the AI Act, ways of using AI, such as robot-assisted surgery and credit scoring, are also categorized as "high-risk" and subjected to strict scrutiny. The best-known European AI company that raised the most amount of funds is French AI startup Mistral, which is backed by over €1 billion in funding. Dubbed as Europe's answer to OpenAI, the company has recently ruled out acquisition and is eyeing an IPO while pushing its open-source AI models and generative chatbot "Le Chat" into new markets.

Posted on 05/13/2025 5:07:00 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump got the royal treatment on his first stop in Saudi Arabia, as white Arabian horses flanked his motorcade — with adviser Elon Musk in tow. Dozens of Saudis rode on horseback carrying US and Saudi flags as Trump’s motorcade peeled into the Royal Court, where he got a warm welcome before going to a lunch in the palace adorned with chandeliers and marble floors. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump told reporters after his arrival, referring to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a friend. He later recalled how “impressed” he was when he first met the 31-year-old MbS back in 2017 during their first visit, and how they quickly became friends. “I like visiting with you, and we’ve known each other very well, and I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said. The president was escorted into the country by six Saudi F-15s bracketing Air Force One, got a 21-gun salute on arrival, and was met with the level of pomp and circumstance that he was met with during his first trip to the kingdom in his first term. The lunch was attended by members of the Saudi government — as well as a number of tech billionaires and business leaders, including Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and more. Other tech guests included Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman — and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. Musk — who has taken one step back from the Department of Government Efficiency and is largely no longer working from the White House — was spotted shaking hands with MbS.

Title: SEC punts decision on crypto ETFs again, final rulings anticipated later in 2025

The regulator postponed decisions on three crypto-related ETFs, while acknowledging 21shares' Dogecoin ETF filing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission postponed decisions on multiple crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on May 13, including those filed by Grayscale and BlackRock. The delays extend the agency’s review timeline and align with expectations that it will grant no approvals before the final quarter of 2025. Grayscale’s proposed spot ETFs for Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) were deferred. The new filing deadlines for both are August 11 and October 10. The SEC also delayed action on BlackRock’s request to enable in-kind redemptions for its approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. BlackRock’s request has no updated deadline, which centers on technical mechanics rather than initial approval. Separately, the SEC acknowledged the 19b-4 filing for a 21Shares spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF, initiating the official review timeline for the product. This filing begins the countdown toward an eventual decision under the agency’s statutory schedule. The agency’s latest moves follow a broader pattern of staggered reviews across more than 70 crypto ETF proposals, which remain in various evaluation stages. On April 29, the SEC delayed decisions on five other crypto-related ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas described the current cycle of delays as routine. Seyffart said the delay was “expected,” and most of the affected products face final deadlines no earlier than October. Balchunas added that the SEC is unlikely to issue substantive approvals until recently confirmed Chair Paul Atkins completes internal meetings and strategy sessions with staff. He said: “They’ve been taking outside meetings with people. Probably coming up with a strategy. After that, likely approvals.” SEC decisions on crypto ETF applications follow a multi-stage statutory process based on the publication of proposed rule changes in the Federal Register. The agency typically operates on review intervals of 45, 90, 180, and 240 days, allowing multiple opportunities to delay decisions before reaching a final deadline. The regulator’s recent actions are consistent with its historical practice of extending reviews to the full statutory limits before issuing decisions. No ETF in this group faces a final deadline before late in the third quarter, leaving applicants and investors awaiting further clarity on the regulatory trajectory for crypto-linked investment vehicles.

Title: New True chief vows to pay firm's 1st dividend in 25 years
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3024911/new-true-chief-vows-to-pay-firms-1st-dividend-in-25-years
Time Published: 2025-05-13T22:36:00Z

The newly appointed group chief executive of True Corporation has outlined his mission for the first 100 days, writing a new chapter for the telecom company by continuing its profitability, driving operations of trusted services, and strengthening data centre development. Sigve Brekke vowed True would pay a dividend in 2025 for the first time in more than 25 years as the company has retired all accumulated losses. He also stressed the need to increase True's revenue. The company reported net profit after tax of 1.6 billion baht for the first quarter of 2025, marking a milestone turnaround within two years of its amalgamation with Total Access Communication (dtac). Excluding the impact from one-off items, the normalised profit for the first quarter was 4.3 billion baht. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation have continued to improve since the merger, driven by a reduction in operational expenses from performance focus and financial discipline, along with ongoing benefits from synergies. "Bringing together True and dtac was an astonishing feat. We united two industry leaders with a sharp focus on performance, financial discipline and synergies, we modernised our networks, and infused AI [artificial intelligence] into customer touchpoints," said Mr Brekke. However, he said he is not satisfied with net profit and performance as the company has to compete with a rival and improve service standards. In the first quarter this year, the company's mobile subscribers declined by 638,000, or 1.3% from the previous quarter, totalling 48.8 million. Mobile subscribers declined 4.4% year-on-year due to the focus on quality subscriber acquisition in 2024, said Mr Brekke. Mobile postpaid subscribers increased 0.2% quarter-on-quarter to 15.3 million for the period, while mobile prepaid subscribers declined by 2.0%, tallying 33.5 million due to seasonality, according to True. Online subscribers increased 0.7% quarter-on-quarter to 3.8 million, while 5G subscribers tallied 14.2 million. Mr Brekke said increasing True's prepaid subscribers and revenue is a crucial mission for the company, particularly as it competes with rival Advanced Info Service (AIS). He started as group chief executive of True on March 11. On March 1, Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group appointed the Norwegian as executive chairman of the telecom and digital business. Mr Brekke said CP Group, through its subsidiary True Internet Data Centre, recently partnered with Global Infrastructure Partners under BlackRock in a move to jointly invest in a digital infrastructure project worth between US$3-5 billion to serve Thailand's digital economy. Strengthening data centre development through partnerships is one of Mr Brekke's missions. "A merger is a marathon, but we have to sprint," he said. Mr Brekke unveiled three strategic moves to fuel the company's growth, focusing on customers, leveraging technology, and empowering staff. The company will ensure a good customer experience by accelerating the integration of systems between True and dtac, modernising and expanding service centres, and delivering a reliable and future-proof network, he said. True will raise awareness among businesses and the public about the potential of AI to stimulate widespread adoption, said Mr Brekke. The company also aims to create a unified organisational culture, ensuring that every approach places the customer at the heart of everything it does.

Title: SEC delays Solana and Litecoin ETFs as Dogecoin and BlackRock proposals enter public comment

Share this article The US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF today, while opening public comment periods for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redemption model and the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The SEC extended its review of the Grayscale Solana Trust to evaluate whether the listing meets investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. If approved, the trust would hold SOL and trade on NYSE Arca. It also delayed a decision on the Grayscale Litecoin Trust, instituting proceedings to further assess whether the listing aligns with requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Both Solana and Litecoin filings now face extended timelines as the agency continues its review. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s filing to amend BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is now open for public comment. The proposed change would allow the fund to support in-kind redemptions, meaning authorized participants could create or redeem shares using Bitcoin directly rather than cash. The SEC initially approved the fund in January with a cash-only redemption mechanism. The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF has also entered its public comment phase following a filing to list under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which covers commodity-based trust shares. The ETF plans to track DOGE prices using a CF Benchmarks index and aims to provide Dogecoin exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. The SEC’s recent actions come as the agency reassesses crypto product listings under new Chair Paul Atkins. The commission has dismissed several enforcement cases and increased public engagement through crypto-focused roundtables since President Trump took office.

Title: Happy 20-year anniversary, Leeroy Jenkins!

We’re still shouting his name two decades later by Kyle Burke Twenty years ago, the name Leeroy Jenkins rang through the halls of Upper Blackrock Spire, and now it echoes through eternity. On May 11, 2005, the famous “Leeroy!!” video was posted to WarcraftMovies, a website dedicated to World of Warcraft machinima. The video came from a guild called Pals for Life. In it, the guild leader addressed the group in a semi-serious tone, asking after coming up with a detailed plan, “Can you give me a number crunch real quick?” In response, the apparent number-crunching guy laid down the first meme of the video, “I’m coming up with 32.33 repeating, of course, percentage of survival.” Don’t ever tell Leroy the odds, because that’s when he declared, “Times up,” and delivered a battlecry for the ages, “Leeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!!!” Soon after charging in from an AFK state, Leeroy Jenkins stepped on a bunch of dragon eggs that spawned hatchlings, killing everybody in the room. When the dust settled a bit, Leeroy was berated, “Goddamn it, Leeroy,” one said, another adding in, “You moron.” Taking things in stride, Leeroy responded with words of wisdom, “At least I have chicken.” It’s gone down in history as a defining moment for viral clips while bringing some gaming culture into the mainstream. The list of pop culture references to Leeroy Jenkins includes a Family Guy bit, trivia on Jeopardy!, a How I Met Your Mother impersonation, a Howard Stern segment, and even U.S. House Rep. Jared Huffman using the rallying call during a Speaker of the House vote. Blizzard kept Leeroy Jenkins alive by turning him into a staple Hearthstone card, rewarding the “Jenkins” title for a World of Warcraft achievement, and making a Leeroy Jenkins NPC voiced by Ben Schulz (the real Leeroy Jenkins) in the Warlords of Draenor expansion. Kotaku confirmed in 2017 that the beloved clip was staged as a comedy skit by the Pals for Life guild after much speculation about its authenticity. Ben Vinson, the video recorder (not Leeroy himself), said, “We didn’t think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire, but we were wrong.” I guess everyone just wants to believe that charging headfirst into danger — chicken in hand — is the best way to go down.

Joining President Donald Trump and top US and Saudi officials for lunch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday are dozens of business leaders from some of America’s largest companies. The executives — from tech firms, banks, consumer groups and other industries, including representatives of four of the 10 biggest US companies by market value — may be there to pitch for business from deep-pocketed Saudi investors, businesses and government departments. Their companies are also dealing with the tariffs imposed by Trump on US trading partners, so the trip is an opportunity to lobby top Trump officials, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on trade policy. Saudi Arabia has emerged as one of the world’s largest investors in artificial intelligence, an effort to diversify the oil-rich nation’s economy and give it influence over one of the hottest sectors in the business world. Notable AI players at the lunch include Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT parent OpenAI; Jensen Huang, the leader of advanced chipmaker Nvidia; Ruth Porat, chief investment officer of Alphabet, Google’s parent company; and Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon, which is a major provider of cloud-computing services. There is also Elon Musk, who, in addition to overseeing Trump’s effort to slash the size of the federal government, also runs Tesla, SpaceX and his own AI company called xAI, which is in talks for new financing that could value the firm at as much as $120 billion. Advertisement The vast sums of money that Saudi Arabia is spending on technology, infrastructure and other priorities have made the country a popular destination for financial executives seeking to advise the kingdom and its companies. Top financial leaders at the lunch include Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jane Fraser of Citigroup.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns on Volatility Despite US-China Tariff Truce

Markets surged yesterday (May 12) on news of a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 climbing to its highest level in months. But BlackRock CEO Larry Fink remains wary of the economic turbulence tariffs could still bring. “There’s going to be a lot of volatility until we have greater certainty as to what is the new equilibrium,” the billionaire said today (May 13) at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh.

You can opt out anytime. In Fink’s view, investors are still struggling to discern the Trump administration’s broader aims for reshaping global trade. That said, he believes the path forward is becoming clearer. “The equilibrium is probably sooner than we thought maybe two to three weeks ago,” he added. The U.S. and China agreed yesterday to a 90-day pause on tariff escalation, scaling back their respective duties: U.S. tariffs are dropping from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China’s will decline from 125 percent to 10 percent. Despite the reprieve, investors remain cautious amid ongoing global economic uncertainty, with many opting for defensive strategies such as holding cash. “When there is that uncertainty, you’re going to keep more and more money in cash, and that’s what we’ve witnessed,” Fink said, noting that this is a global phenomenon. In Europe, he pointed out, 12 trillion euros are currently held in bank accounts, while U.S. money market funds are sitting on $11 trillion. Fink also emphasized that tackling economic uncertainty must include addressing the U.S.’s ballooning deficit—something he’s warned about in the past. “Let’s be clear: the U.S. deficits are an issue,” Fink said. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter. To reach a sustainable 3 percent growth rate, Fink said, the country will need to lean more heavily on private investment.

Title: Elon Musk Brings Starlink to Saudi Arabia as U.S. Oligarchs Join Trump in Middle East

Elon Musk says his satellite internet provider Starlink, a part of SpaceX, has been approved in Saudi Arabia for maritime and aviation use. The billionaire made the announcement while being interviewed at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, a conference where several American oligarchs have joined President Donald Trump to cut deals with the Saudi royal family. Musk “thanked the kingdom for approving Starlink,” referring to the Saudi government, without explaining further, and teased that he’d like to bring his nascent robotaxis to Saudi Arabia. “Yeah, so really you can think of a car or future cars as being robots on four wheels. And you know, I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom, indeed, if you’re amenable,” Musk said “You heard it here from Elon,” the interviewer said. “He’s bringing his robotaxi to the kingdom.” Musk didn’t offer any specifics and is long known as a bullshitter, so it’s not clear how serious the billionaire is about bringing robotaxis to the Middle East. Tesla plans to launch a trial of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, but details on that venture are still scarce. Musk also promoted his tunnel-digging venture, The Boring Company, while on stage, explaining that his goal was to “solve traffic” by digging tunnels underground. The billionaire hyped The Boring Company relentlessly during Trump’s first term but has only delivered the most pathetic results. Musk billed his ideas, like the Hyperloop and The Loop, as next-generation, high-speed answers for transportation. In the end, he’s only delivered a slow-moving Tesla driven by a human and hobbled public works projects. But that didn’t stop Musk from insisting that his only functional tunnel ride in Las Vegas, “feels like teleporting for one part of Vegas to another.” Most people do not describe the experience like that. Musk’s America PAC, one of the political arms the billionaire started to help get Trump elected in 2024, shared a video on X that included Musk talking about humanoid robots. Elon Musk's full remarks at the SaudiâU.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh pic.twitter.com/E6orrvgZYA — America (@america) May 13, 2025 “My prediction, actually, for humanoid robots is that ultimately they will be tens of billions,” Musk said, according to CNBC. “I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it, like, as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2. But even better.” President Trump was supposed to be the main attraction at the forum on Tuesday, and his presence in Saudi Arabia was extremely weird, to say the least. Trump opened his speech at the conference with organizers playing Lee Greenwood’s song “God Bless the USA,” as though it was the national anthem or something. Trump stood there in silence for the entirety of the song as the room all stood in silence. The camera periodically cut to Saudi leader Mohammad bin Salman, sometimes known as MBS, and he appeared to be stifling laughter. Trump, who earlier had trouble keeping his eyes open, largely focused on U.S. domestic politics and his personal grievances during the speech, which may not have been exceptional if he had been on American soil. Historically, it’s more normal for U.S. presidents to expand their focus when traveling overseas and not bring up petty matters in an international setting. These aren’t normal times, of course. Several American business leaders were spotted in Riyadh on Tuesday, including Palantir CEO Alex Karp, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even announced his company would be selling 18,000 of its latest AI chips to Saudi Arabia, according to CNBC. But not every tech oligarch was on hand for the forum. In fact, Trump called out Apple’s CEO saying during his speech that, “Tim Cook isn’t here,” apparently upset about that for some reason. “This week there are multi-billion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, they’re all here… Uber, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, and many more,” Trump said. “So I want to congratulate everybody. So many great business executives, many of you… most of you, I know.” Trump went on to say “they weren’t that happy when they saw me,” apparently referring to his election in Nov. 2024, “and now they’re saying, sir, you’re doing a great job, thank you very much. It’s amazing what a rising market will do.” And Trump isn’t altogether wrong. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who criticized the president during his first term, was spotted meeting with both MBS and Trump in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Altman has been rallying behind Trump, as AI boosters believe the Republican president can help inject money into their technology. Trump has held close ties to MBS and the Saudi royal family, even after the leader became an international pariah during Trump’s first term. Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the order of MBS in Istanbul, Turkey, but Trump has always cozied up to the most brutal dictators around the world while denigrating the leaders of liberal democracies. President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would be buying $600 billion of military equipment. And Trump’s tech buddies, from Musk to Altman, are happy to go along for the ride as long as it helps their bottom line. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: The inflation fight isn't over. Forecasters expect tariffs to show up in prices as soon as next month
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-april-cpi-tariffs-prices-trump-trade-war-economci-outlook-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-13T17:07:49Z
Full Content:
Americans got some relief from inflation last month, but top forecasters say the effects of the trade war aren't yet being reflected in the data, and the coming months could see a fresh spike in prices. The consumer price index cooled unexpectedly in April, with the overall inflation rate dipping to 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.4% in March. But consumers might be navigating another bout of inflation in the coming months. For one, the data is backward-looking and takes time to appear in official statistics. Firms, meanwhile, appeared to stockpile inventory in the first quarter to avoid tariff-related costs. Advanced imports of consumer goods surged as much as nearly 30% during the quarter, Morgan Stanley said. "This number doesn't matter, because the tariff effects are really going to start to show up in next month's number," Ellen Zentner, the chief economist strategist at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division, told CNBC on Tuesday after the CPI report. Higher numbers in next month's CPI data imply that prices will start to increase for consumers as soon as this month. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said he believed the inflationary impact from tariffs would "escalate" in the summer months. At the moment, there's little evidence to suggest tariffs have affected inflation, besides a slight increase in auto prices, he wrote on Tuesday. John Kerschner, the head of US securitized products and a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, also said he believes inflationary pressures from tariffs could show up starting in June. "Thus, the market will wait with bated breath for those readings to make a determination of where we actually stand on tariff-induced rising prices," he wrote in a note. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel speculated that price increases could come over the next several months. "Again, I don't think we're going to be seeing the effects of this tariff until, you know, maybe June or July. Because so little actually did come into this country and then get priced at the retail level and then sampled by the government officials to get in," Siegel told CNBC prior to the CPI report. Banks have adjusted their forecasts for inflation and economic growth after the US struck a deal with China to lower tariffs for 90 days, but many on Wall Street are still anticipating higher inflation by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs estimated that core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise from 2.6% annually in March to 3.6% by the end of the year. "Our forecast reflects a sharp acceleration in most core goods categories," the bank wrote in a note, adding that it believes tariffs would cause the "most acute" price increases in consumer electronics, autos, and apparel. "There was maybe a hint of tariffs in the data as a few line items with significant imports-household furnishings, medicinal drugs, IT commodities, and toys-saw price increases accelerate this month. But we continue to expect clearer evidence in the months ahead," Bank of America analysts wrote following the CPI release. Economists have warned that tariffs could stoke inflation for Americans, as companies could pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. The average effective US tariff rate will likely end up somewhere around 17%, the Yale Budget Lab estimated this month. That's lower than previous forecasts, but still the highest average tariff rate the US has seen in more than 80 years, Siegel said. Jump to

Title: Capital Markets: New Zealand pushes for renewable investment amid high demand, setbacks

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Genesis Energy's Waipipi wind farm in South Taranaki. Photo / Brett Phibbs, PhibbsVisuals THREE KEY FACTS New Zealand is being promoted as the “smart choice” for investors in renewable electricity, where tens of billions of dollars must be spent in the capital-hungry sector to meet demand and environmental goals. The new push to attract big money came at the New Zealand Infrastructure Investment Summit in March and following the event, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says it is seeing “significant investor interest” among developers and investors from Japan, Korea, Britain, Germany and from investor migrants through the Active Investor Plus visa programme. As of early May, the renewable energy prospectus released during the summit had been viewed 358 times and downloaded 85 times. The big push for capital comes at a time when there have been high-profile setbacks for large-scale renewable projects and the abrupt exit of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, after a solar power investment soured. Fast-track consenting processes are now in place but so is a growing queue to have projects considered under new rules. But energy experts at one law firm describe the renewable investment opportunity as “immense” and in a prospectus released by the Government at the summit, the case for it was set out. “With an abundant supply of renewable energy, robust renewable foundations and growing energy demands, New Zealand is the smart choice for your investment.” As New Zealand progresses towards its net-zero aims by decarbonising every sector of the economy, this country’s reliance on electricity is projected to soar, with demand growing by 60% over the next 25 years. To meet this, industries will increasingly rely on our abundant supply of renewable energy. “This presents an enticing proposition, not only to invest in New Zealand’s growing renewable energy and green fuel sectors, but to use our natural resources to your business’s advantage,” the prospectus from Invest NZ says. “Proximity to export markets in Asia and Australia and the country’s strong sustainability goals positioned the renewable energy sector to grow exponentially – benefiting the planet and investors alike.” While in 2023, around 88% of New Zealand’s electricity was generated from renewable sources, there was “huge growth potential” to power industrial processes and transport with clean energy as electrification drives demand. A MinterEllisonRuddWatts report into investing in the renewable energy sector, published last December, says the Government’s domestic target of doubling renewable generation by 2050 will help drive an increase in its electricity supply by close to 70% by 2050 to meet domestic needs, as the New Zealand economy electrifies. In real terms this equates to approximately 400-500 megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity needed every year through to 2050 – a rate of development never seen in this country before. The firm also notes that to support all this new generation, it is estimated at least $22 billion of investment in the distribution network is needed this decade. “Accordingly, the opportunity for investing in renewable energy projects and the associated infrastructure needed is immense, with long-term returns.” Another MinterEllisonRuddWatts report, on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the renewables sector, was published just before the summit and shows high levels of activity. It says as of September last year, there had been more than 160 projects, predominantly wind and solar. Because not all projects in the pipeline will be completed (or complete under current ownership), there remains scope for new entrants, strategic investment and, more relevantly, consolidation or sell-down by existing investors and developers. Independent developers may continue to struggle to secure bankable, offtake arrangements, such as a PPA (power purchase agreement) for a project. It says the New Zealand PPA market is immature and a lack of offtake impacts funding decisions, so some projects may need to be sold. Last year was a busy one for M&A in the renewables sector. MinterEllisonRuddWatts noted that: ● Singapore-based fund management company SC Oscar acquired 100% of utility-scale solar developer Rānui Generation. ● Lodestone announced the acquisition of two grid-level solar sites in Manawatū from Kiwi Solar. ● Genesis Energy secured an advanced stage, 127-megawatt peak (MWp) consented site near Edgecumbe in Bay of Plenty from Helios Energy. ● In September, Contact Energy Ltd entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to acquire up to 100% of the shares in generator and wholesaler Manawa Energy Ltd through a scheme of arrangement. The deal values Manawa at $1.86b. ● Genesis took a $64 million, 65% stake in EV charging company ChargeNet NZ Ltd, reflecting Genesis’ ambition to be one of the major players in EV charging networks. ChargeNet has more than 400 fast-charging points nationwide and Genesis’ investment is expected to boost the pace of network development. The Government’s Invest in New Zealand prospectus points to global demand for renewables skyrocketing – and New Zealand is perfectly positioned to meet it, thanks to an abundance of accessible resources generated by hydro, wind, solar and geothermal. Developments in hydrogen and other biofuels also offer significant investment opportunities and excellent export potential. Although big energy users and consumer groups have different views, the Government’s pitch says the country’s energy and electricity markets are mature and open-access. The Electricity Authority monitors the market to ensure fair competition and consumer protection. The Government says it is committed to ensuring businesses have access to secure electricity at internationally competitive prices. At this year’s New Zealand Energy Conference, the Major Energy Users Group warned of the risk of de-industrialisation, with energy-intensive industrial sectors gradually moving their production elsewhere or reducing levels of production here. It said increases in transmission and distribution charges were impacting all consumers and with fewer parties supplying gas, businesses were “having trouble getting long-term gas contracts alongside electricity at reasonable prices”.

Title: Institutional Investors Drive Surge in Bond ETFs

BlackRock expects bond ETF assets to more than triple to $6 trillion worldwide within five years. Bond exchange-traded funds have been racking up investment inflows over the last few years and continue to gather steam, thanks in large part to institutional investors, according to BlackRock. The asset management giant forecasted bond ETF assets to more than triple, to $6 trillion worldwide, by the end of the decade. According to a BlackRock report, it took 17 years for bond ETF assets to reach $1 trillion in 2019 and then just another five years for that figure to climb to $1.7 trillion as of the end of September 2024. “The global bond ETF industry is growing faster than expected,” the report stated. “A key driver of this growth has been the adoption of fixed-income ETFs by institutional investors.” According to BlackRock, the 10 largest asset managers—and nine of the 10 largest insurance companies—along with some central banks, are using the investment vehicle. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  The report also stated that growing use of actively managed ETFs has contributed to the sharp rise in bond ETF assets. The report found that while bond ETF growth has traditionally been fueled by index-based investments, that source has expanded to now include actively managed ETFs, which provide access to sub-asset classes that are more difficult to index. “Historically, active strategies have only been available in mutual funds or separate accounts,” the report stated. “Today, however, the expanding landscape of active fixed income ETFs enables institutional investors to access these same strategies.” The report cited a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of institutional investors that found that nearly 25% of respondents are considering investing in active ETFs over the next year or two. “Increasingly, active ETFs are becoming critical components in fixed-income portfolios alongside index and enhanced index strategies,” the report stated. “In fact, over the past three years, U.S. actively managed bond ETFs have outpaced the growth of index ETFs at an annualized 26% rate.” According to the BlackRock report, actively managed strategies currently account for 14% of U.S. fixed-income ETF assets under management and 8% of total U.S. ETF assets. “The growth rate of active ETF assets is expected to outpace total ETF growth in coming years, in part driven by the evolving demands from the institutional investor base,” the report stated.

Title: Why Did Trump Invite Travis Kalanick on His Trip to Saudi Arabia?

Donald Trump’s first visit to Saudi Arabia as president for the second time came with some standard fare, like an unbelievably massive arms deal he signed on Tuesday. Less orthodox is the lunch scheduled for today, which featured leading executives in American business and finance as well as a few random hangers-on. The lunch was part of a summit in which Saudi leaders agreed to a purported investment of $600 billion in American companies, mostly working in tech, artificial intelligence, and, of course, defense contractors. (Of the $600 billion sum, $142 billion will go to American defense firms selling missile systems, training, and the like.) To prepare for the glut of oil money coming their way, the president invited many leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI; Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir; Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton; Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia; and Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon. Most of the names on the list make sense. If you’re looking at boosting Saudi investment in U.S., you probably want BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman there. If you’re looking at further investment in American AI, Altman, Huang, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna are going to be munching apps, too. Obviously, Elon Musk is going to be there. But there are a few standouts. Why the mayor of Miami in Riyadh? What are the CEOs of Coca-Cola or Epic Games doing there? And what about Travis Kalanick, the former bad boss of Uber? The answer is kind of obvious: Saudi money and/or Trump fealty. For example, Kalanick’s latest venture is a ghost-kitchen company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — which is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the Middle East. Or take Miami mayor Francis Suarez, a staunch cryptocurrency booster who has backed the president’s pro-crypto industry policies. Despite leading the 42nd-largest U.S. city, he ended up with a ticket. Beyond securing the $600 billion promise, Trump, for one, did not seem especially focused at the meeting, commenting on Apple CEO Tim Cook’s absence and bragging about winning “all seven swing states.” But the real question remains this: Why isn’t the McDonald’s CEO there?

US President Donald Trump secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States after the oil power accorded him a gala welcome at the start of a tour of Gulf states.Trump punched the air as he emerged from Air Force One to be greeted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on energy, defence, mining, and other areas.The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, according to a White House fact sheet that called it "the largest defense cooperation agreement" Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said."Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum," the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a US-Saudi Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Trump's visit.

Reuters reported in April that the US was poised to offer the kingdom an arms package worth well over $100 billion."I really believe we like each other a lot," Trump said during a meeting with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.The US and Saudi Arabia had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom is long thought to have been interested in.It was not immediately clear whether those aircraft were covered in the deal announced on Tuesday.Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. "While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of asset manager Blackstone; and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Musk chatted briefly with both Trump and the crown prince, who is otherwise known as MbS, during a palace reception for the US president. And joining Trump for a lunch with MbS were top US businessmen including Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.MbS has focused on diversifying the kingdom's economy in a major reform programme dubbed Vision 2030 that includes "Giga-projects" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium. Oil generated 62% of Saudi government revenue last year.The kingdom has scaled back some of its ambitions as rising costs and falling oil prices weigh.Saudi Arabia and the US have maintained strong ties for decades based on an ironclad arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security in exchange.MbS' ties with Trump have been smoother than with his predecessor, Joe Biden. Their relations were strained by the 2018 killing of Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US intelligence believed the killing was ordered by MbS. He denied involvement.Trump did not include Israel on his schedule although he wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the Gaza war.Israeli officials have put a brave face on Trump's decision but there are growing doubts in Israel about its position in his priorities as frustration mounts in Washington over the failure to end the 19-month-old war.Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups' leaders, have at the same time given Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies.US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman at the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails.Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Trump in his 2017-21 first term under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel.But opposition by Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters.
