A rally in European stocks slowed while US equities tread water as markets digested stronger-than-expected wholesale price inflation data and US bond yields rose. The Iseq index rose by 1.1 per cent, slightly outperforming its European peers. Cairn Homes jumped 2 per cent after lodging new plans for 236 apartments and 16 houses from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The Irish banks also moved higher as part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. AIB climbed 3.4 per cent to close at €7.41 per share, while Bank of Ireland jumped 2.1 per cent to €13.22. Ryanair also advanced, adding 0.6 per cent to €26.30 per share while other large caps like Kingspan and Kerry Group were little changed. Adding to Wednesday’s 16 per cent surge, Glanbia added another 1.4 per cent to close at €14.32 per share after the nutritionals group raised its earnings forecast earlier in the previous session. European shares touched two-week highs as the blue-chip Stoxx 50 added 0.7 per cent and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by 0.5 per cent. Insurers were in the spotlight with the likes of Swiss Re reporting earnings. The firm was down 3.9 per cent on the session, despite reporting better than expected net profits for the first half. Meanwhile, Carlsberg fell 5.5 per cent after the Danish brewer missed half-year profit and volume forecasts, and said it did not expect any improvement in the consumer environment this year. Thyssenkrupp tumbled 8.9 per cent after the German conglomerate cut its full-year outlook for investments and sales, citing disruption from US tariffs. After three consecutive sessions of gains, British stocks were little changed, with the benchmark FTSE 100 essentially flat on the session and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index down by 0.2 per cent. Insurers led sectoral gains with Aviva jumping 2.4 per cent after jumping to its highest level since 2007 earlier in the session. The group raised its interim dividend on Thursday after reporting a stronger half-year operating profit. British insurer Admiral hit a record high, rising 5.8 per cent after a strong first-half profit. The energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, down 1.3 per cent Harbour Energy led the losses, falling 4.5 per cent, while oil majors Shell and BP fell by 1.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent. Industrial metal miners also retreated amid weakness in copper and iron ore prices, with Rio Tinto down by 4 per cent and Anglo American down by 1.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.5 per cent after announcing it will jointly buy National Grid’s Grain LNG terminal with US-based Energy Capital Partners for about £1.5 billion (€1.7 billion). Wall Street’s main indices were little changed in early trading on Thursday despite a stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading that spurred a rise in bond yields and the dollar. US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, suggesting companies are passing along higher import costs related to tariffs, raising the spectre of renewed price pressures and causing traders to trim bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month. After a recent rocket-fuelled rally, the S&P 500 was flat despite gains in big tech stocks. Cisco Systems lost 1 per cent after the network equipment manufacturer’s broadly in-line forecast did little to encourage investors. Deere & Co fell 8 per cent after the farm-equipment maker reported a lower quarterly profit and tightened its annual profit forecast, while Tapestry plunged 17.6 per cent after the Coach handbag maker forecast annual profit below estimates. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Ian Curran is a Business reporter with The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical is commencing US commercialisation through a small speciality salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: Who Thought It Was a Good Idea to Put Matt Rife in a Make-Up Ad?

By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | August 14, 2025 For some reason, Matt Rife has remained weirdly popular over the past few years. Despite a cavalcade of misogynistic jokes, palling around with Jordan Peterson, and pissing off Marc Maron, the man with the iPad jaw has kept getting work. He recently bought Ed and Lorraine Warren’s home and Occult Museum, which includes all of the fake haunted stuff those scammers claimed to have dealt with over the course of their deceitful careers. That seems like a good match of personalities, I suppose. It certainly makes more sense than putting Rife in an advert for make-up. e.l.f. Cosmetics paired up Rife with drag queen Heidi N. Closet for an ad on ‘beauty injustices.’ That means over-priced make-up, not brands taking massive investments from companies like BlackRock, which was listed in a recent report from the United Nations mapping out the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians during their siege on Gaza. It’s a weird ad and Rife’s weird face doesn’t help matters. View this post on Instagram A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) Why is Matt Rife in this? Putting aside the misogyny and his off-putting personality and his desperation to appeal to men because he was so embarrassed by his once-dedicated female fanbase: what does this man have to do with make-up? Would you buy anything beauty-related from this man? Does he have good genes… I mean jeans? Having drag artists do something like this at least makes sense. Maybe if one of the contestants of King of Drag was there alongside Heidi, I’d appreciate some consistency. If Rife does wear concealer, I don’t for a minute think he’d admit to it, at least not without making some homophobic gag in the process. Plus, the irony of a guy who got famous making jokes about domestic violence playing a lawyer? Hmm… e.l.f. Cosmetics probably wanted people to react with the same fake fervour of American Eagle’s Sydney Sweeney ads. Mostly, their core demographic just thought this was dumb and didn’t want a gross sexist near their eyeshadow. So, they issued a ‘we’re listening and we hear you’ non-apology, because why not? A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) This is as believable as Matt Rife claiming his Crimson Chin-esque jaw growth was down to puberty. Bless.

Ark Invest said it bought more than 2.5 million shares of crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) on the day of the company’s explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange, securing a stake valued at more than $170 million by the end of the day. Shares of the company, which owns CoinDesk, surged to as high as $102 from the $37 IPO pricing, before closing at $68, an 84% gain. The company sold 20.3 million shares for its initial public offering, which had also attracted interest from BlackRock (BLK), according to a filing with the SEC. Ark added 1,714,522 BLSH shares to its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 545,416 shares to the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and 272,755 shares to the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Bullish's rally extended into Thursday, recently trading 15% higher. That performance comes as the broader crypto market slipped, erasing part of the prior day’s gains when bitcoin BTC$117,359.14 hit a record high of $124,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index is down about 2.1% over the past 24 hours. Other recently listed crypto-related stocks fell. Circle (CRCL), which went public in June, fell about 2% Thursday, while trading platform eToro (ETOR) dropped nearly 3%. Wood has a track record of making sizable early moves in newly public crypto firms. Upon Circle’s IPO, Ark purchased about 4.5 million shares, valued at roughly $373 million at the time. Those shares are now worth about $675 million. Her stake in eToro is smaller — around 140,000 shares — currently valued at $6.5 million. Bullish’s strong debut and Ark’s rapid allocation across multiple ETFs highlight growing investor interest in publicly traded crypto infrastructure companies, even as market volatility remains high.

Title: Bitcoin In Retirement Funds—Here’s The 69% Monthly Dividend Play
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/14/bitcoin-in-retirement-funds-heres-the-69-monthly-dividend-play/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T14:58:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The US is quietly monetizing its $36 trillion deficit (printing money to pay for it). Just around the edges. For now. Which supports more upside for this 69% dividend that is powered by Bitcoin. And Uncle Sam’s money printer. Yes, Fed Chair Jay Powell is stubbornly sticking with high rates. Vanilla pundits claim a “hawkish” Fed is supportive of the US dollar. Yes, but—let’s look past Powell’s hollow words for his actions! Behind the scenes, the Fed is quietly “buying” up to $25 billion monthly from Treasury auctions. Without Fed involvement, less demand would mean higher rates to attract buyers. Who wants to fund Uncle Sam’s “spend like a drunken sailor” habit? So when an auction is slow, the Fed picks up the slack. If you are scratching your head, you’re on to something. The Fed has the same income as my seven-year-old—zero. My daughter asks mom or dad to pay for the ice cream. The Fed essentially creates the cash out of thin air to buy the bonds. This is effectively printing new money. The Treasury issues, the Fed absorbs! This is bearish for the buck and explains why it is down 10% year-to-date relative to other major currencies. And why monetary hedges such as gold and Bitcoin have soared in 2025. In a minute we’ll highlight a Bitcoin ETF that yields 69%. (No, that is not a typo.) But first, let’s discuss another policymaker trick. Treasury debt—which the Fed is helping mop up—has traditionally been issued at the long end of the curve. Think bonds of 10 and 30 years in duration, purchased by pension funds and sovereigns. Janet Yellen flipped this on its head during the end of her term as Treasury Secretary in another effort to keep long rates from rising. She began issuing 75% of government debt on the “short end” of the yield curve—two years in duration or less. This “short instead of long” issuing practice was unheard of only a few years ago. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was critical of this practice. However, he has not only continued it but also turned up the volume a notch. Scotty dishes 80% of the debt in short duration! By issuing more short-term debt, the US needn’t rely on the “kindness” of strangers (other sovereign nations) and pension funds to finance its deficit. Banks can permanently stash more (cheaper!) short-term debt on their balance sheets. Recent legislative changes will let banks lend (long) against this debt, indirectly contributing to monetary expansion. Which brings us to Bitcoin. Historically, gold was the haven against monetary mismanagement. Today, Bitcoin – the “OG crypto”—is rapidly emerging as a credible alternative store of value, endorsed by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. The bullish Bitcoin news keeps coming. Last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Bitcoin as an investment option in 401(k) retirement plans. “America’s ticker” SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) will have some competition, especially with millennial retirement participants! In April, we added ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) to our Dividend Swing Trader portfolio to play this trend. BITO harvests premiums from Bitcoin contracts and pays an impressive monthly dividend annualizing to a sizzling 69%: I look at BITO as more of a trading vehicle than a “buy and hold” forever idea. After all, Bitcoin plummeted more than 75% between late 2021 and 2022. I’m not comfortable with readers risking that type of drawdown. Fortunately, we don’t have to. BITO makes for a great Dividend Swing Trading fund. Bitcoin, which drives the price (and payouts) of BITO, tends to rally sharply and sustain momentum for months at a time. This is exactly the type of holding period we strive for at DST. We like to buy right and then sit on our hands as gains accrue (swing, if you will) in our favor. We’re up 36% since our initial BITO purchase, a trade that annualizes to 118%. The fund has already paid us back 19% of our original purchase price in dividends. Plus, it has appreciated in price. When it dips, we buy more. On June 17, I issued an alert that BITO was a Best Buy—it has rallied 11.2% since (109% annualized). And that’s all before factoring in the new 401(k) catalyst. Last Thursday in DST, BITO topped our Best Buy list again. It didn’t take long to pop—3.6% in four days (for a terrific 2,600%+ annualized).

Title: Analysts believe $10,000 Ethereum price is inevitable as institutional buying increases, PEPE and RTX could 20x

Analysts are becoming increasingly confident that the Ethereum price will hit $10,000 as institutional buying accelerates. Massive inflows from large funds are pushing ETH into a stronger position than ever, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone adding $640 million worth of ETH in a single day. While Ethereum dominates headlines, traders are also paying close attention to the PEPE coin and an emerging project called Remittix, which many believe could rival the biggest names in the next bull cycle. These three assets are becoming central to discussions on the best crypto project 2025 and the next big altcoin 2025. Source: TradingView The Ethereum price is currently trading around $4,630, just 5% below its all-time high. This move comes after a breakout from a multi-year pattern, backed by over $10 billion in institutional inflows. As historical data has shown, ETH tends to hit 30-35 percent of Bitcoin market cap during major runs, which would put the Ethereum price between 8,500 and 10,000 dollars in case Bitcoin hits 150,000 dollars. In-chain statistics also indicate that long-term holders invest with confidence whereas short-term traders are taking profits. Analysts think that these trends and increasing use in DeFi project ecosystems and cross-chain DeFi project integrations, indicate continuing upward pressure. This optimism is why many still list ETH among the top crypto to buy now and the best long-term crypto investment. The PEPE coin has recently seen trading volumes double to nearly $900 million, signaling renewed market interest. A whale investor turned $200,000 into nearly $2 million after holding PEPE for nine months, highlighting the token’s explosive potential. The PEPE price chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern that often leads to significant breakouts. Source: DexGemsReal If the PEPE coin moves above key resistance at $0.00001600, analysts predict gains of up to 773%, potentially pushing it toward $0.00010. With rising open interest and spot market inflows, this low cap crypto gem could surprise many in 2025. For traders seeking the next 100x crypto or crypto with passive income potential, PEPE remains firmly on the watchlist. While Ethereum price targets dominate the headlines, Remittix is quietly building momentum that could outpace both ETH and the PEPE coin in percentage gains. The project has already raised over $19.3 million through the sale of more than 596 million tokens at $0.0922 each. Unlike most hype-driven projects, Remittix delivers real-world utility with a platform designed to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Its audited smart contracts, mobile wallet with real-time FX conversion and upcoming centralized exchange listing reveal a project with strong fundamentals. Why Remittix Could Dominate the Next Bull Run This combination of tech and utility positions Remittix as one of the best DeFi projects 2025 and a crypto solving real-world problems, making it a serious contender for the fastest growing crypto 2025. Ethereum price momentum, PEPE coin’s breakout potential and Remittix’s strong fundamentals create a compelling trio for investors. ETH is the best long term crypto investment to gain institutional exposure, PEPE is a high growth crypto to add to a risk tolerant portfolio and Remittix has the rare combination of utility and growth. These assets may set the stage for the future of crypto projects and early stage crypto investment opportunities as the next big crypto launch cycle heats up.

Irish housebuilder Cairn Homes is to lodge new plans for 252 residential build-to-sell units for one of the few available sites in Blackrock in south Dublin that is suitable for a higher density apartment scheme. Cairn Homes is to seek permission for 236 apartments and 16 houses from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused permission for 355 build-to-rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of such apartments for the area. ACP refused planning permission after James M Sheehan, co-founder of the Blackrock, Hermitage and Galway Clinics, claimed that the plan “is grossly excessive”. This was one of more than30 objections were lodged against the scheme. [ Cairn Homes refused permission for 280 new homes in south west DublinOpens in new window ] Cairn previously secured planning permission for an apartment scheme on the site but this was quashed by the High Court in July 2019 following residents’ opposition. Addressing ACP’s grounds for refusal on the proliferation of built-to-rent apartments for the area, planning consultants for the new scheme, McCutcheon Halley Chartered Planning Consultants (MHP) state that new scheme “offers 252 built-to-sell units, which align with the identified housing needs in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council”. MHP states that the scheme would “facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village”. The developers are proposing a density of 100 units per hectare and MHP states that “the proposed density and mix is considered suitable for the site ensuring a sufficient quantum of units is provided whilst also protecting the amenity of existing adjoining residential properties”.

In plans to be lodged with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Cairn Homes is seeking permission for 236 apartments and 16 houses at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused planning permission for 355 build to rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of build to rent apartments for the area. ACP refused planning permission after co-founder of the Blackrock, Hermitage and Galway Clinics, James M Sheehan, claimed that the plan "is grossly excessive". This was one of over 30 objections were lodged against the scheme. Previously, Cairn secured planning permission for an apartment scheme on the site but the planning permission was quashed by the High Court in July 2019 following residents' opposition. Addressing ACP's grounds for refusal on the proliferation of built to rent apartments for the area, planning consultants for the new scheme, McCutcheon Halley Chartered Planning Consultants (MHP), state that new scheme in contrast "offers 252 built to sell (BTS) units, which align with the identified housing needs in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and contributes to addressing Ireland's housing demand". MHP state that the scheme "will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village". MHP further state that "the design rationale is to create and deliver a high quality sustainable residential development within this strategic infill site which respects its suburban setting and maximises the site's natural attributes while making maximum efficiency of existing infrastructure". The developers are proposing a density of 100 units per hectare and MHP state that "the proposed density and mix is considered suitable for the site ensuring a sufficient quantum of units is provided whilst also protecting the amenity of existing adjoining residential properties". As part of its social housing obligations, Cairn Homes is proposing to sell 25 units to the Council. A letter from the Council states that "while the unit costs exceed the Council's approved acquisition cost threshold, it is acknowledged that the stated costs are estimated, as actual costs cannot be quantified at this preliminary stage". The Council letter states that "the Council may seek a revision of the Part V proposal following evaluation of costs and land values". Reporting by Gordon Deegan © RTÉ 2025.

Ethereum is closing in on its all-time high, and investors are asking if this is just a rally or the start of a decade-defining bull run. Trading near $4,605 after touching $4,783, Ethereum has surged 16% in five days, driven by institutional buying, ETF approvals, and the powerful impact of the Pectra upgrade. Analysts at Fundstrat call it “the biggest macro trade of the next decade,” with price targets as high as $15,000 by year-end.

Title: Hutchison Sees “Reasonable Chance” of $22.8 bln Ports Sale Going Through

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Clare Jim and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison said on Thursday its $22.8 billion ports business sale had a “reasonable chance” of going through after a plan to add a Chinese major strategic investor to the buying consortium, as it tries to navigate through Sino-U.S. tensions. CK Hutchison, based in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong, has faced heavy criticism from Beijing since unveiling a plan in March to sell 43 ports in 23 countries, including two near the Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and Italian Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping firm MSC. President Donald Trump had called for the U.S. to “take back” the Panama Canal, which is used by more than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion annually, from Chinese influence. CK Hutchison’s ports are not on the canal or part of it, however. “We are into a new stage of our deal,” group co-managing director and finance director Frank Sixt told analysts at an earnings conference. “There is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included. And most importantly, that we’ll be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.” On July 28, the conglomerate said it was in talks to include a Chinese “major strategic investor” in the bid for its ports, and that it would allow as much time as needed to secure approval in relevant jurisdictions. On Thursday, Sixt said these included China, the U.S., Britain and the European Union. He said the talks were taking much longer than expected but that this was “not particularly troublesome” because the port business had delivered stronger earnings and cash flow this year than expected. Sources have said the investor is COSCO – one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. They said COSCO wanted a bigger stake while the other parties were keen to keep it a minority. ALLAYING CHINESE CONCERNS The inclusion of a Chinese investor would alleviate Beijing’s security concerns and have its blessing, the sources and other experts have said. COSCO did not respond to a request last month for comment. Thursday’s results conference was the first opportunity for analysts to quiz management about the ports deal. But chairman Victor Li, eldest son of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who took over the conglomerate from his father, was missing for the first time, as was deputy chairman Canning Fok. Also unusually, CK Hutchison did not brief analysts or media about its 2024 earnings when it released them in March. Its shares closed down 0.4% on Thursday ahead of the results, in line with the Hang Seng Index .HSI. The conglomerate posted an 11% rise in first-half underlying profit to HK$11.3 billion ($1.44 billion) on a post-IFRS 16 basis. UBS had forecast a 6% rise. However, including one-time non-cash accounting loss, notably from the merger of 3UK and Vodafone UK, net profit dropped 92% year-on-year to HK$852 million. The company said global trade and consumer demand affecting its ports business would remain volatile in the second half due to uncertainty over trade disputes and geopolitical risks.

Title: Exclusive: Former Goldman Sachs exec heads to crypto startup founded by former Meta engineers

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another Wall Street executive is defecting to the crypto industry. Mustafa Al Niama, former head of the Americas digital assets desk for investment bank Goldman Sachs, is joining blockchain developer Mysten Labs as head of capital markets, he told Fortune. He’ll help lead the crypto company’s outreach to large financial institutions, he said. “The objective is to expand that sphere materially more than what we have today,” Al Niama added. He’s the latest from the world of Wall Street to join an industry populated not so long ago by teens and twentysomethings in hoodies. Others include Mary-Catherine Lader, a former rising star at asset manager BlackRock who jumped ship in 2021 to join Uniswap Labs. There’s also Tom Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, who joined crypto exchange Bullish as CEO in 2023. The flow of Wall Street executives into crypto mirrors the increasing integration of two sectors that were once thought to be opposites. Large banks like JPMorgan Chase are experimenting with issuing digital tokens meant to represent one dollar of deposits. And other institutions are exploring how to tokenize money-market funds, or put financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Al Niama already has experience sitting between Wall Street and crypto. He spent four years at American Express before he switched over to Goldman Sachs in 2015, where he eventually worked his way up to becoming a regional head on the firm’s digital assets desk. One of the initiatives he led was a collaboration announced in July between Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, or BNY, to launch tokenized money-market funds. Now, he’s joining one of the most deep-pocketed firms in crypto. Founded by former engineers from Meta’s scuttled stablecoin project, Libra, Mysten Labs has raised about $336 million from prominent firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Franklin Templeton, according to PitchBook. (The company also raised significant sums from the venture arm of the failed crypto exchange FTX but bought back the stake after FTX declared bankruptcy.) Mysten Labs is the main developer behind the Sui blockchain, which uses some of the tech that engineers at Meta had once developed for the social media giant’s crypto moonshot. “Hiring Mustafa as head of capital markets is the next step towards helping the ecosystem bring Sui’s mainstream public blockchain to institutional finance,” Ryan Servatius, global head of partnerships at Mysten Labs, said in a statement to Fortune. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: BlackRock’s Rick Rieder says this is the ‘best investing environment ever’ — he’s conveniently in the running for next Fed chairman

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, Rick Rieder, is bullish. He says the landscape has never looked so good for investing and believes Jerome Powell should be cutting interest rates. Rieder also happens to be in the running for Fed chairman, according to numerous reports. While the White House will be mindful of the fact that Jerome Powell’s successor will need to be a credible economic force, President Trump has also been clear that the next chair will be more dovish than the current one. Trump has been waging a one-sided war against the Fed since winning the Oval Office (and indeed began criticizing Powell even before the election), aggressively lobbying the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut rates. Having awarded the Fed chairman the nickname of “Too Late Powell,” Trump has turned his attention to Powell’s replacement when his term ends in May 2026. Trump has said he will name that individual shortly, potentially in a move to shift the market’s attention to the incumbent, dovish power. Rieder appears on a list of candidates in the running for that job, according to reports from CNBC and Fox Business. And the CIO is saying many of the things the Trump camp will want to hear. Speaking to CNBC’s Closing Bell yesterday, Rieder said a few “extraordinary things” in the economy had convinced him that now is the “best investing environment ever.” “First of all, the technicals and equities are crazy,” Rieder said. “[The] amount of cash on the sideline, the amount of buybacks relative to the IPO calendar—i.e., the demand versus supply—is pretty extraordinary. “Then you take the other side of it in fixed income—I think the Fed can cut rates, but until then—you got yield levels, you can create a portfolio with a 6.5%, 7% yield. That’s pretty good.” Rieder added that volatility in equities is relatively low at the moment, minimizing downside risks. Along with bullish signals on the Wall Street side (a token of approval that President Trump has demonstrated is important to him), Rieder is also confident of the need to cut the base rate from its current level of 4.25% to 4.5%. “I think it’s almost a given that they cut [in September],” Rieder said. “You’re seeing some sogginess around job hires, around job openings … more slack coming into the labor market. I still think the funds rate, you can get it down faster and more aggressively than where they are today.” Rieder did say the Fed will have to remain “respectful” of tariff costs. Markets will like this if he wins the Fed role as they, too, are pricing in some level of inflation as a result of the White House’s import cost regime. It will also be a check beside his name in the eyes of analysts, who will see it as a mark of independence from the political rhetoric, which is to insist that foreign governments will “eat” the hikes. President Trump, on the other hand, won’t like hearing talk of tariff inflation. In a note previously reported by Fortune, Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng wrote that the majority of tariff costs are likely to be passed through to consumers. This sparked fury from President Trump, who urged Goldman CEO David Solomon to “get a new economist” or consider resigning. The Fed sticks closely to its dual mandate of inflation at a target rate of 2% and maximum employment. The base interest rate is its lever to control these two factors. Breaking with tradition, Rieder suggested the base rate isn’t that useful when it comes to controlling price rises. He noted: “The interest rate tool doesn’t do a lot today. You think about how companies finance capex … You’re not borrowing. The banks are asset liability. The interest rate tool is not that important except for a couple of big factors. What it does to housing, and you look at mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, new home sales—it’s stuck. “The mortgage rate has to come down, you drop the funds rate, there’s some yield curve [steepening] that probably happens. And then the other side of it is the low-income people who are borrowers. They are getting hurt by this; high-savings older people are actually benefiting from the high rates.” BlackRock declined Fortune’s request for comment. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Thumzup Media to invest $50M into mining as Trump eyes Jerome Powell’s replacement. Thumzup Media, backed by Donald Trump Jr., has raised $50 million to invest in crypto mining and blockchain as Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high. This coincides with President Trump’s latest attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Thumzup Media Corporation, a social media and crypto buying firm linked to Donald Trump Jr., has secured $50 million to push into crypto mining and blockchain bets. The move comes as Bitcoin [BTC] hits a new ATH and President Donald Trump threatens a “major lawsuit” against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Fresh off a $50 million capital raise through a $10-per-share offering, the firm plans to expand its strategy to include large-scale Bitcoin mining and targeted blockchain investments. Source: thumzupmedia.com Part of the funds will go toward purchasing advanced mining rigs, with talks already underway with technology providers to fast-track deployment. Thumzup, which bought its first Bitcoin in January and now holds 19.1 BTC, joins a growing list of public companies treating crypto as a strategic asset. Donald Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares in the company. Building on Thumzup’s bullish timing, Bitcoin surged past $123,231 on the 13th of August, a fresh all-time high on Coinbase. The milestone came alongside a record-setting S&P 500, as softer-than-expected inflation data caused optimism in risk markets. July’s CPI held steady at 2.7% year-over-year – below forecasts – while monthly price growth slowed, strengthening bets on a September rate cut. The CME FedWatch tool now pegs those odds at nearly 96%. Source: cmegroup.com Looser monetary policy and an end to quantitative tightening have so far supported Bitcoin’s momentum. Investors also see effects from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill making way for more crypto gains. As Bitcoin’s rally unfolds, the political spotlight is also on the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Jerome Powell, calling him “Too Late” and claiming “the damage” as “incalculable.” He blasted a $3 billion Fed building project as “a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!” Source: Truth Social Meanwhile, the administration is vetting 11 potential successors for when Powell’s term ends in May. New names in the mix include Jefferies strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder. They join a roster of seasoned monetary policy hands. Officials have described the process as “deliberative.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to interview all contenders before narrowing the field for Trump’s decision.

Title: Our corporate leadership class

Time Published: 2025-08-14T04:00:00Z

Some readers may disagree, but I get the sense that corporations, especially large bureaucratic ones, foster leaders who do not possess strong opinions about anything. The leaders that do emerge seem to be pliant creatures who practice a repugnant form of leadership through consensus, continually testing the waters to determine the least offensive position that they might take for the moment. Granted, there are exceptions to this rule like Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump tapped for Energy Secretary, and even Elon Musk, who despite his dumb-headed notion of an E.V. future for all has strong opinions about where things should head. Why are there so many servile nullities pervading our corporate leadership class? The most prominent case in point, are the CEOs of the oil majors. They spend half their time walking around with their head down and the other half apologizing for the perceived ills their product may have inflicted upon society. I was recently struck by the following passage from an article in The Economist: That includes the oil-and-gas industry, which is struggling to find a way to decarbonise profitably. Murray Auchincloss, bp’s boss, announced a shift away from renewable energy and back to fossil fuels in a ‘fundamental reset’ earlier this year. On July 22nd news broke that Shell, Enbridge and Aker bp, three oil companies, had quit the SBTi’s advisory group set up to define what ‘net zero’ means for oil companies. They are said to have left because they were told achieving it would mean not developing new oil- and gas-fields. For those that have not read The Economist, this is standard fare from a magazine that whole-heartedly embraces the platform of the World Economic Forum. However, my point is that the passage unwittingly reflects poorly on the forward-thinking ability of the CEOs of the three oil companies. They join an advisory group set up to define what “net zero” means for oil companies, only to be told later that achieving it would mean not developing new oil and gas fields. In the words of Homer Simpson, “D’oh!” What explains such cluelessness? One explanation might be the degree to which they are beholden to institutional investors. CEOs cravenly seek the approval of institutional investors who have the power to sink their stock price by selling a large number of shares if they don’t like what they see or hear coming from a CEO. As a class, institutional investors are even worse than CEOs. They are conditioned to rationalize anything. They embrace new (corporate) fashions as enthusiastically as any New York City socialite shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. In the same article referenced earlier, another passage gives one a feel for the mindset of institutional investors: Financial institutions are also backsliding. Along with hsbc, big American banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have dropped out of the nzba [Net-Zero Banking Alliance], as have some from Japan and Canada. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, estimates that the leavers account for two-fifths of the group’s total assets. The same problems are afflicting similar organisations, such as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. This year Wells Fargo, another American bank, scrapped some of its emissions-reduction plans and in March Switzerland’s ubs pushed back its climate targets after acquiring Credit Suisse. Part of the problem for financial institutions is politics, which was shifting even before Donald Trump returned to the White House. In America Republican senators have suggested that joining a green alliance could breach antitrust rules. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election the pressure has been cranked up.

What can we infer from the passage about institutional investors? It is not a flattering picture. After years of burdening corporate leaders with having to reach arbitrary net zero metrics, institutional investors are scrapping it as they sense that the public is not buying into the woke agenda. It is a sad indictment of corporate America that CEOs are so cringingly servile and institutional investors so vacuous. Image generated by AI. Some readers may disagree, but I get the sense that corporations, especially large bureaucratic ones, foster leaders who do not possess strong opinions about anything. The leaders that do emerge seem to be pliant creatures who practice a repugnant form of leadership through consensus, continually testing the waters to determine the least offensive position that they might take for the moment. Granted, there are exceptions to this rule like Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump tapped for Energy Secretary, and even Elon Musk, who despite his dumb-headed notion of an E.V. future for all has strong opinions about where things should head. Why are there so many servile nullities pervading our corporate leadership class? The most prominent case in point, are the CEOs of the oil majors. They spend half their time walking around with their head down and the other half apologizing for the perceived ills their product may have inflicted upon society. I was recently struck by the following passage from an article in The Economist: That includes the oil-and-gas industry, which is struggling to find a way to decarbonise profitably. Murray Auchincloss, bp’s boss, announced a shift away from renewable energy and back to fossil fuels in a ‘fundamental reset’ earlier this year. On July 22nd news broke that Shell, Enbridge and Aker bp, three oil companies, had quit the SBTi’s advisory group set up to define what ‘net zero’ means for oil companies. They are said to have left because they were told achieving it would mean not developing new oil- and gas-fields. For those that have not read The Economist, this is standard fare from a magazine that whole-heartedly embraces the platform of the World Economic Forum. However, my point is that the passage unwittingly reflects poorly on the forward-thinking ability of the CEOs of the three oil companies. They join an advisory group set up to define what “net zero” means for oil companies, only to be told later that achieving it would mean not developing new oil and gas fields. In the words of Homer Simpson, “D’oh!” What explains such cluelessness? One explanation might be the degree to which they are beholden to institutional investors. CEOs cravenly seek the approval of institutional investors who have the power to sink their stock price by selling a large number of shares if they don’t like what they see or hear coming from a CEO. As a class, institutional investors are even worse than CEOs. They are conditioned to rationalize anything. They embrace new (corporate) fashions as enthusiastically as any New York City socialite shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. In the same article referenced earlier, another passage gives one a feel for the mindset of institutional investors: Financial institutions are also backsliding. Along with hsbc, big American banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have dropped out of the nzba [Net-Zero Banking Alliance], as have some from Japan and Canada. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, estimates that the leavers account for two-fifths of the group’s total assets. The same problems are afflicting similar organisations, such as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. This year Wells Fargo, another American bank, scrapped some of its emissions-reduction plans and in March Switzerland’s ubs pushed back its climate targets after acquiring Credit Suisse. Part of the problem for financial institutions is politics, which was shifting even before Donald Trump returned to the White House. In America Republican senators have suggested that joining a green alliance could breach antitrust rules. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election the pressure has been cranked up. In January ten state attorneys-general wrote to America’s biggest financial firms, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, threatening legal action if the companies did not change their climate and diversity policies. What can we infer from the passage about institutional investors? It is not a flattering picture. After years of burdening corporate leaders with having to reach arbitrary net zero metrics, institutional investors are scrapping it as they sense that the public is not buying into the woke agenda.

Title: Bitcoin hits new all-time high as Fed easing bets and favorable US policy align
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-as-fed-easing-bets-and-favorable-us-policy-align/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T02:29:53Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin blasted through to a new all-time high on Thursday, as a perfect storm of roaring optimism over Federal Reserve policy and a series of powerful pro-crypto reforms converged to send the digital asset into uncharted territory. The move signals a dramatic new phase for a market that has been supercharged by a seismic shift in the US political and regulatory landscape. In early Asian trading, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed as much as 0.9% to touch $124,002.49, decisively surpassing the previous peak it set in July. The tidal wave of buying lifted the broader market, with the second−largest token, Ether, surging to 4,780.04—its highest level since the bull market of late 2021. This record-setting rally isn’t a random surge; it’s being powered by a clear confluence of forces. According to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, Bitcoin’s momentum is a direct result of “increasing certainty of Fed rate cuts, sustained institutional buying and moves by the Trump administration to ease investment in crypto assets.” The technical picture is now just as bullish, with Sycamore noting that a decisive move could open the floodgates for a much larger run. “Technically a sustained break above $125k could propel BTC to $150,000,” he wrote in a note. Since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the regulatory environment in the United States has transformed from hostile to overtly favorable. Trump has proudly labeled himself the “crypto president,” and a series of long-sought regulatory wins for the industry have followed throughout 2025, from the passage of landmark stablecoin regulations to a broader overhaul by the securities regulator to accommodate digital assets. The market impact of this policy pivot has been staggering. Bitcoin itself has risen nearly 32% so far in 2025. More broadly, the entire crypto sector’s market capitalization has ballooned from about $2.5 trillion in November 2024, when Trump won the election, to over $4.18 trillion today, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The latest and perhaps most significant tailwind came from an executive order signed last week on Thursday. The order paved the way for crypto assets to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could unlock a colossal new wave of mainstream capital for the asset class. This is not just a win for investors; it’s a potential boon for asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, whose crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could become staples of American retirement planning. However, this push into long-term savings is not without its perils. The very volatility that creates spectacular rallies also poses significant risks, especially for retirement accounts that have historically relied on the relative stability of stocks and bonds. For now, though, the market is firmly focused on the upside, celebrating a new era of legitimacy that has sent its leading asset to heights once thought unreachable.

Nothing screams bull market more than an influx of institutional investors and a growing risk appetite from traditional enterprises in crypto assets and the crypto market. We are now seeing this phenomenon play out in real time in the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, such as Ethereum. The second-largest altcoin by market cap has increased by 17% in the past week and is now edging ever so closer to breaching the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time. While this is obviously bullish for Ethereum, it also spells good news for other altcoins in the market, as some of this liquidity and capital are bound to flow into the most hyped tokens at some point as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts believe these three tokens, ENA, ETHFI, and RTX, could benefit from this liquidity spread as the bull market intensifies. There has been a phenomenal increase in the Ethereum price over the past week, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surging by 17%. This is thanks to an influx of liquidity in the token and its various crypto investment products, such as Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts estimate that around $1 billion in liquidity has gone into Ethereum in the past week as investor confidence increases as the bull market intensifies. This means several things. One is that Ethereum could finally breach past the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time since it launched in 2015. It also means that ETH-based tokens could enjoy a price surge shortly, as some of the Ethereum liquidity trickles down into other assets as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts have tipped ENA and ETHFI as possible winners from the scenario, but they’ve also tipped their weight behind RTX, an upcoming native token in the fast-growing PayFi scene. Crypto analysts are throwing all their weight behind Remittix, an upcoming PayFi project with impressive fundamentals, as the bull market intensifies. With the recent Ethereum price boost, analysts believe Remittix’s native token, RTX, could benefit massively from the trickle-down liquidity, causing a price spike when it eventually launches. Remittix has caught the eye of the crypto industry recently, thanks to its impressive and innovative features, most of which are expected to transform the global payments experience.

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soared as high as $102 in initial trades on Wednesday, their first day of action on the New York Stock Exchange before closing at $68. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share, above the expected $32 to $33 range. That price valued the Cayman Island-based crypto exchange at a total market value of $5.4 billion. Bullish, which is the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this week expanded the amount of shares it sold in its IPO to 20.3 million as investor appetite turned out to be larger than anticipated. Both BlackRock and Ark Investment Management had expressed interest to buy up to $200 million worth of shares. “The last leg of growth in crypto in the last 10 years was basically all retail and if you look now, the institutional wave has begun, it’s here, it’s a question of how big it will be,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley said in an interview with CNBC. Unlike retail-focused exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, Bullish targets institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets while relying on the oversight and safeguards of a centralized platform. The exchange saw trading volume of over $1.25 trillion as of March 31, since its launch in 2021, according to a filing. “Bullish's $1.1 billion IPO raise reflects growing institutional confidence in the crypto exchange sector, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration and Bitcoin's surge past $100,000,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “This success, alongside Circle's strong IPO performance, signals that institutional investors are increasingly viewing centralized exchanges as viable long-term investments. However, sustained confidence will depend on regulatory clarity and market stability,” he said. The company’s debut comes at a time of booming interest in crypto-related projects, specifically from Wall Street, as U.S. regulators are getting close to a regulatory framework for the space, allowing participants to engage in a safe way.

Title: ‘Well worth viewing’: Perseid meteor shower to continue Wednesday night
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/science/space/2025/08/13/well-worth-viewing-perseid-meteor-shower-to-continue-wednesday-night/

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Justin Skelton, the chief information officer at Dine Brands, envisions a world in the not-too-distant future where an IHOP server can scan a QR code and pull up every detail about a guest’s order preferences and history. Using generative AI to guide them, servers can then suggest the perfect side dishes to complement that order of pancakes and sausage. This AI-powered “recommendation engine,” which utilizes Google Cloud’s recommendations AI technology, is already in production for online orders at the restaurant operator’s IHOP and Applebee’s chains and will also roll out soon at Dine’s Fuzzy’s Taco Shop. It blends together a guest’s past order history with the buying patterns from a broader pool of similar diners to generate more personalized menu pairings. But there could be even greater opportunities for targeted, in-person upselling when the technology could be deployed across the chain’s 3,5000 brick-and-mortar restaurants. “There’s a lot of new technologies we’re looking at that we want to bring to the market,” says Skelton, who has served as CIO at Dine since 2019, after prior technology leadership roles at CVS Health, Bank of America, and Allstate. Skelton says that all of his generative AI bets are intended to support three outcomes: boost revenue and traffic, improve the guest experience, and bolster worker productivity. Because he runs a small IT team, Skelton says he has to be very careful about his technology bets. “We’re not prepared to go and invest in and hire a lot of people,” says Skelton. With that in mind, Dine tends to partner and “buy” more solutions from vendors rather than build. Skelton relies on large AI companies like Google and Amazon and non-hyperscalers like IT consulting firm Cognizant. The latter helped Dine create and launch an AI Innovation Foundry last fall, a virtual lab that is led by Skelton’s IT team and works with different stakeholder groups including legal and finance to test emerging AI technologies. Initially only available for corporate employees, the Foundry became so appetizing that franchise partners have also been encouraged to submit use cases for Dine’s team to vet. “There’s a recognition that not all ideas are going to make it and see the light of day,” says Skelton. “It’s really sort of a way we can incubate.” With budget planning for 2026 already under way, Skelton and his team will mull the proposed use cases and a steering committee will determine the few select projects that will get capital allocation. Some newer concepts that Dine is considering include AI-enabled tools that can make it easier for the general manager to understand their staffing levels, inventory, and other data needed to make a restaurant run smoothly and utilize that real-time data to make better decisions. Another is an evolution of Dine’s generative AI assistant tool that guides the company’s franchise technology services team, a group of technicians that resolves issues like when a printer breaks or a point of sale system is down at a restaurant. In the future, Dine hopes to make this a self-service tool, allowing franchisees to access Dine’s technician data to solve some of their own problems. Investments in AI to improve back office functions, demand forecasting, and predicting the appropriate staffing level for any given day are all efforts that can bolster the bottom line. That’s especially critical in the restaurant industry, which operates on notoriously thin margins. For customer-facing applications of AI, many restaurant chains have prioritized AI-enabled recommendation tools that are flourishing online. Chains like Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Wendy’s have all deployed or tested AI-enabled drive-thru technologies to varying degrees of success. There is also a fine line that casual-dining chains like Dine must balance when adding technology—a playbook that differs from fast-food operators like McDonald’s and Burger King. At those chains, guests often prioritize the speed of service, which has fueled the popularity of ordering kiosks in recent years. But at Applebee’s or IHOP, diners crave a more personal connection. “There’s still that human touch and that human interaction that cannot be replaced with technology,” says Skelton. “But it can be enhanced, without a question, and we’ve got to figure out how to get that right.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. The AI talent war continues to intensify. A lot of new media reports have homed in on the aggressively expensive AI talent war, including a piece from The Wall Street Journal that cites research showing that Anthropic’s retention rate is higher than rivals OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The Financial Times reports that Apple has been losing AI staff to rivals throughout the year while Business Insider says that Elon Musk’s xAI has hired 14 AI researchers and engineers from Meta since January. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, commenting on the marketplace in a recent interview with CNBC, says this is “the most intense talent market I have seen in my career.” He adds that the compensation packages will be especially intense for “a very small number of people right now.” The New York Times reports that pay packages for the most elite talent is rivaling that of NBA stars like LeBron James and Steph Curry. GPT-5's bumpy debut. Last week, OpenAI launched a new version of its flagship product, GPT-5, which the company says delivers “more accurate answers than any previous reasoning model,” and is less prone to hallucinations than previous models, has better coding functionality, scores higher to offer medical health advice, and integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar for agentic capabilities. But the product's "real-time model router"—which automatically decides which one of GPT-5’s several variants is best suited for each particular job—sparked a user backlash. While the router was designed to save users from the hassle of manually pickings models, many users bristled at the lack of control. Still, as Fortune's Sharon Goldman reports, these model routers may be the future of AI. Nvidia, AMD strike deal for export licenses in China. American chip makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD is the sponsor of this newsletter) have agreed to pay 15% of their revenue from Chinese AI chip sales to the U.S. government, an unusual arrangement that Bloomberg reports may set a new precedent for U.S. companies that seek to do business in China. Nvidia announced its plans to share 15% of the revenue of the company’s H20 AI accelerator in China, according to President Donald Trump in a briefing with reporters on Monday, while AMD’s deal was reported by Bloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter. Separately on the chips front, Trump last week demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, following a request from Republican Sen. Tom Cotton for more information about Tan’s ties to Chinese companies. After Tan met with Trump on Monday though, the POTUS said he would be spending more time working things out with Tan, whose career he pronounced an "amazing story." Nearly half of developers don’t trust the accuracy of AI tools. An international survey of over 49,000 developers found that a lack of trust is growing in AI tools even as the use of these tools proliferates in the development process. 46% of developers say they don’t trust the accuracy of the output of AI tools, a big increase from 31% in last year’s survey, which was conducted by developer question-and-answer website Stack Overflow. Other notable nuggets from the study include that a majority of developers still aren’t using AI agents (only 31% are doing so). The large language models that are used by most developers are OpenAI’s GPT models (81%), Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet models (43%), and Google’s Gemini Flash models (35%). When it comes to technologists and their evolving approach to work, 66% of developers say they spent time in the last year learning new coding techniques or a new programming language and 44% have turned to AI tools to learn how to code, up from 37% last year. But “vibe coding,” a buzzy new practice of writing code with AI using natural language prompts, still isn’t embraced by most. Nearly 77% say they aren’t vibe coding for their professional work.

Title: BlackRock's $2.4 trillion money manager says the market is in the most bullish investing environment ever
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-sp500-investing-blackrock-rick-rieder-2025-8

For Rick Rieder, the stock market has never looked so good. The chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock says he thinks the market has emerged into the "best investing environment ever," thanks to a cluster of factors that are setting up a bullish backdrop for equities. Rieder's ultra-bullish view isn't shared by all. Concerns about the US economy and the impact of tariffs have caused the percentage of investors who said they were bearish on stocks over the next six months to rise to 43% in the last week, according to the latest AAII Investor Sentiment survey. But for Rieder, who manages $2.4 trillion of client money, the setup right now is ideal. "It doesn't mean necessarily that everything's going up, but there's a couple of things at play that are pretty extraordinary," Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday. Here's what's driving his optimism. The technical backdrop for equities is highly favorable. Investors have around $7 trillion of cash sidelined in money market fund, which some have said could fuel fresh gains for stocks as rates come down in the coming months and that money is deployed into equities. Corporate stock buybacks are also at record highs. That's setting up an excellent supply-demand picture for the market, Rieder said. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Corporate earnings are still holding up despite pressure from tariffs. Of the the S&P 500 companies that have reported results for the second quarter, 81% have beaten earnings estimates, above the 10-year average, according to the latest update from FactSet. If that proportion of earnings beats holds, it will mark the best earnings season for the benchmark index since 2023, BlackRock said in a recent note. Earnings strength also applies to some of the market's most popular stocks. If you exclude Tesla from the Magnificent Seven, earnings growth among the group of tech stalwarts is growing at a pace of around 54% year-over-year, Rieder said. At that rate, Rieder said Big Tech stocks' high valuations aren't greatly concerning. The Fed has room to start cutting interest rates again in September, and potentially more aggressively than markets expect, Rieder said, pointing to two catalysts in particular: Rieder said he believed it was "a given" that the Fed would issue its next rate cut in September. He also speculated that the central bank had room to lower interest rates a full percentage point from the current levels, which would imply the Fed funds rate target range falling to its lowest level in about three years. Productivity growth could also rise, Rieder said, pointing to advancements in tech, space, data, and spending on AI in particular. "All of these are geared towards higher productivity, operating at a lower cost basis. That's where we're going," Rieder said of recent tech trends. Higher productivity implies steeper economic growth overall, though labor productivity among all workers actually declined over the last year. The total output among all nonfarm workers dropped to around 1.3% year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "I'm sanguine on the economy. I think we're moving generally in the right direction," Rieder later added. Jump to

Lara Rizério Agências de notícias 13/08/2025 09h31 13/08/2025 09h31 Publicidade O governo do presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, está avaliando 11 candidatos para substituir o chair do Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, quando seu mandato expirar em maio de 2026, informou a CNBC nesta quarta-feira, citando dois funcionários do governo. Os novos nomes incluem David Zervos, estrategista-chefe de mercado da Jefferies, Larry Lindsey, ex-governador do Fed, e Rick Rieder, diretor de investimentos de renda fixa global da BlackRock. Eles agora se juntam a uma lista de outros oito candidatos que a CNBC confirmou estarem sob consideração, incluindo a vice-presidente de Supervisão do Fed, Michelle Bowman, o governador do Fed, Chris Waller, e o vice-presidente do Fed, Philip Jefferson. As autoridades também confirmaram que entre os candidatos estão Marc Summerlin, assessor econômico do governo Bush, a presidente do Fed de Dallas, Lorie Logan, e o ex-presidente do Fed de St. Louis, James Bullard. Saiba em 1 minuto quanto seu dinheiro pode render “Incapacidade de compreender conceitos básicos” e “disposição de induzir a erro” são como alguns economistas caracterizam E.J. Antoni, que pode chefiar o Departamento de Estatísticas de Trabalho dos EUA Lula havia dito que não vai telefonar para Trump para negociar a tarifa de 50% imposta sobre produtos brasileiros por considerar que Trump não quer conversar, mas que iria ligar para convidá-lo para a cúpula climática O presidente Trump disse recentemente à CNBC, em uma entrevista, que Kevin Hassett, diretor do Conselho Econômico Nacional, e o ex-governador do Fed, Kevin Warsh, estavam entre os indicados em sua lista. As autoridades descreveram um “processo deliberativo” em que o secretário do Tesouro, Scott Bessent, entrevistará todos os candidatos, selecionará os candidatos e encaminhará a lista final ao presidente para sua decisão. O tamanho da lista e o processo descrito sugerem que uma decisão não é iminente e pode levar um tempo considerável, mas as autoridades não ofereceram um cronograma. Continua depois da publicidade Quanto mais longo o processo, menor a probabilidade de haver um “presidente sombra do Fed” no cargo por vários meses antes da saída de Powell, o que alguns sugeriram que seria prejudicial à política monetária. Embora critique Powell com frequência quase diária, o presidente Trump recuou das sugestões de que poderia substituir o presidente do Fed antes do final de seu mandato em maio. (com Reuters e informações da CNBC) Lara Rizério Editora de mercados do InfoMoney, cobre temas que vão desde o mercado de ações ao ambiente econômico nacional e internacional, além de ficar bem de olho nos desdobramentos políticos e em seus efeitos para os investidores.

Happy days are here again for Ethereum ($ETH) and its investors as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency broke the $4,600 mark. This brings $ETH to a level unseen since late 2021. Institutional investors and Ethereum ETFs have primarily driven the rally that began earlier this month. This bullish sentiment will also have a positive impact on the wider market and top ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) as traders seek to diversify their investments. Growing appetite for $ETH has driven its price since the beginning of August, resulting in a record number of inflows on Monday of over $1B, based on data from SoSo Value. BlackRock has been one of the biggest winners so far, after its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF reportedly accounted for $640M of these inflows. But investors aren’t done buying $ETH just yet. On Monday, SharpLink Gaming announced a raise of $400M to growing its $ETH holdings to over $3B. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion also expanded its Ethereum stash in a single week from 833,137 to its current holdings of over 1,150,263. This further extends the company’s lead as the biggest owner of $ETH and the third-biggest in DAT (total value of digital assets held). This flurry of activity has resulted in a 27.36% increase in Ethereum’s value in just seven days. It’s also been up by 6.93% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $4,623. As Ethereum returns to its late 2021 levels, we can already expect traders to look for other investments to put their money in. ERC-20 tokens are potential winners too, especially Ethereum crypto presales. They’re typically very cheap and offer a huge growth potential, making them extremely attractive to investors. Here are three worth considering: There’s no denying that Bitcoin remains king, as it continues to attract institutional investors like Strategy, which now holds 628,946 Bitcoins, valued at $75B. You’re looking at a future Bitcoin Layer 2, which will improve transaction speed and lower the fees, while also expanding the crypto’s utility according to modern demands. The key to this is the Canonical Bridge that will let you send $BTC from Layer 1 to Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. The latter is a high-speed environment powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which enables fast transactions and low fees while keeping Bitcoin’s robust security intact. You only need to deposit $BTC to get started. The system will verify and mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2. This will allow you to use this wrapped $BTC for staking, trading, and interacting with dApps—things that aren’t possible with Bitcoin. Here’s a comprehensive guide on Bitcoin Hyper if you want to learn more about it. To support the project, you can join the Bitcoin Hyper presale and buy tokens for $0.012675 each. You can also stake your tokens, if you prefer, and earn rewards at a rate of 120% p.a. Our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide has all the details you need to get your hands on $HYPER. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction estimates a $0.15-$0.32 price range for the end of 2025, which would mean a 1,090%-2,430% potential growth if you invest now. Buy Bitcoin Hyper tokens today to join an upcoming revolution in Bitcoin programmability and scalability. As demand for cryptocurrencies grows, it becomes more difficult to find high-quality ones. This is the case when you’re looking for the best meme coins. It’s like playing Russian roulette sometimes, as some could be scams that could cost you your hard-earned money. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. With just a few clicks, you’ll be able to snipe, trade tokens, manage your portfolio, and more. The bot also comes with a honeypot and rugpull detection feature that will help keep scammers and hackers at bay. Holding its native $SNORT token opens up even more perks when Snorter Bot launches, such as low transaction fees and governance rights. Of course, you’ll also be able to use it to pay for gas fees. $SNORT is currently available for only $0.1011 via the Snorter Token presale page. The staking rewards are very generous too at 143% p.a. Alternatively, you can consider HODLing as the token could reach as much as $3.25 by 2030 based on our Snorter Token price prediction. Whether you want to HODL, trade, or stake $SNORT, now’s your chance to take part in one of this year’s best presales. Join the Snorter Token presale today. Like $DOGE that it’s trying to parody, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) started out as a joke back in 2021. But now it’s so much more than that. It’s a payment method not just in crypto payment platforms but also in retailers, restaurants, and digital wallets. The coin had its peak back in late 2021, reaching a price of around $0.000088, based on TradingView data. While it’s mostly hovered around $0.000012-$0.000015 this year, $SHIB has been quite hot lately as it grew by a considerable 12.53% in the last seven days. While some traders might argue that the coin’s glory days are behind it, there are still many who remain bullish about $SHIB. With a market capitalization of over $8B and over 1.5M wallets holding it, it’s not the type of meme coin that will go away soon. Unlike the two previous ERC-20 coins we covered, $SHIB is widely available in major exchanges. Its low price, high liquidity, and wide availability can help you practice your trading without burning a hole in your wallet. As Ethereum broke past $4,500, it’s safe to say that its rally isn’t over yet. Like Bitcoin’s surge in July, we expect institutional investors to push $ETH’s price to greater heights, with a potential to return to its $4,800 ATH set in 2021. ERC-20 tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) will be in other investors’ sights too if the trend continues. That’s because these investors will be looking at other promising coins to put their money in, in the hopes of growing their gains further. Disclaimer: Do your own research before you invest.
