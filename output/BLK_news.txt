Skip to comments. Posted on 08/19/2025 9:39:59 AM PDT by packagingguy Volkswagen is now offering owners of its ID.3 EV hatchback the option to boost their car‚Äôs performance ‚Äî for a monthly subscription fee. Instead of following the traditional model of offering improved performance through upgraded components, VW has locked its car‚Äôs true potential behind a software subscription. Auto Express reports that German automaker Volkswagen has introduced a subscription-based model for unlocking the full potential of its ID.3 electric car, a new model available in the UK. While the ID.3 Pro and Pro S models are listed on the configurator as producing 201 horsepower, buyers must pay a monthly subscription fee of ¬£16.50 ($22.29) to access the car‚Äôs maximum output of 228 horsepower. This subscription, which comes after a one-month free trial, is nearly three times the cost of a standard Netflix subscription with ads. Owners can also opt for a lifetime subscription priced at ¬£649 ($877), which remains tied to the vehicle even if it is sold. Volkswagen states that the performance upgrade increases the net power by 27 horsepower and the maximum torque from 265Nm to 310Nm without affecting the car‚Äôs range. As the ID.3 is registered at 228 horsepower from the factory, owners are not required to inform their insurance company about the upgrade. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

Like GM offering 3 different V6 engines with a total horsepower range difference of 30 HP. People are gullible. ‚Äú...for a monthly subscription fee‚Äù I exactly what Microsoft Office 365 is doing. Ditto with some other software companies are trying. Long term it will serve to piss off customers. I suspect car companies which do not hinder the cars performance will do better in the marketplace. I actually like it. You can try it out for a cheap monthly price, and if you like it pay the life-time fee of $877. It‚Äôd be analogous to trying the powerful 8-cyl gas car cheaply for a month before paying $877 extra for it vs the cheaper 6-cyl. You pays your dollar, you takes your chance............... and they wonder why some people cheer when executives from Blackrock or United Healthcare are shot. The Babylon Bee should do a story on this. Volkswagen: Pay a monthly fee or your trunk will no longer open. Pay a monthly fee or you won‚Äôt be able to make right turns. Come on, Bee. Get on this. üêù Well l love heated seats and steering wheel Good grief! European style customer service. The Japanese would never think to do such a thing. the id.3 doesn‚Äôt even have an engine does it? I thought they were full electric I have my doubts unless the "official" measurement method never tops out either car's power usage or the lower powered car's milage is artificially reduced. If you use more power, your battery life goes down. We are deep into the new economic model. Owning nothing, being happy. Serfs were not property, but they were tied to the land, which was owned by a lord. The serf had to work the land for the lord because there was no other option. Slaves were property. They did the work they were told to do, they could be sold to distant places, families could be broken up. Free people work where they want to, earn their own money, and can purchase ‚Äústuff‚Äù which is their own property. Now you can‚Äôt really own much of anything. I‚Äôm not sure I see the benefit of working and striving. Technofeudalism. It‚Äôs no fun being a serf or a wage slave.

Title: Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks ahead of a storm, and could buy them back after it hits, top strategist says
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-stock-sales-cash-apple-dietrich-market-crash-recession-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-19T14:57:38Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett may be cashing in stocks because he sees a storm on the horizon ‚Äî and could buy them back once prices tumble, a senior market strategist says. The "Oracle of Omaha" has a "history of selling out of the stock market" when economic and financial indicators are "signaling a bear market or a recession is coming," Wedbush's chief investment strategist, Paul Dietrich, told Business Insider. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks for 11 straight quarters, even though the market has "soared" to new highs in that period, Dietrich added. The investor's conglomerate offloaded $212 billion of shares while only buying $34.5 billion, meaning its net disposals exceeded $177 billion ‚Äî more than the market value of BlackRock or Boeing. Buffett also halted stock buybacks for the last four quarters as he no longer saw Berkshire stock as cheap, Dietrich said. The pause marks a big change from Berkshire's peak repurchases of over $20 billion in both 2020 and 2021. Berkshire's share sales and lack of buybacks have contributed to its cash pile, which more than tripled to a record $344 billion over the three years to June 30. Buffett has jettisoned stocks and gone to cash ahead of past downturns, Dietrich said. Berkshire grew its cash pile from around $11 billion in 1997 to $35 billion in 1998, and ramped up its net stock sales from $700 million in 1999 to $2.7 billion in 2000, ahead of the dot-com crash. The corporate titan had grown its cash pile to more than $70 billion when the financial crisis struck. It fell to about $52 billion by the end of 2008 as Buffett made a series of lucrative deals during the disaster. Berkshire ramped up its net stock purchases from around $5 billion in 2006 to $11 billion in 2007 as it capitalized on depressed asset prices. Buffett sounded cautious about the market during Berkshire's annual meeting in May, Dietrich said. Before his shock announcement that he intended to step down as CEO at the end of this year, Buffett bemoaned the lack of potential bargains as asset valuations continued to rise. Dietrich said the "Buffett Indicator" may be alarming the Berkshire CEO. The gauge, which compares the US stock market's value to the US economy's size, has surged to historic highs of above 210%, he said. That means the combined market capitalization of all actively traded US stocks is more than double the latest quarterly estimate of US GDP. Buffett once wrote that buying stocks at readings approaching 200% would be "playing with fire." The Wall Street veteran recalled Buffett's famous advice to "be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful," saying the Berkshire chief is preparing to pounce once valuations fall to attractive levels. Dietrich said Buffett would use his cash pile "to eventually buy back Apple and the other shares he has sold ‚Äî but at a major discount ‚Äîafter the current nose-bleed stock market highs eventually come back down to earth." Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Startup‚Äôs Technique Brings Mathematical Precision to Gen AI

Highlights Neurosymbolic AI blends neural networks with logic-based reasoning to reduce hallucinations and improve trust in generative AI. Amazon and Imandra are advancing the approach in parallel, Amazon with warehouse robots and shopping assistants, Imandra with finance, code verification and regulatory compliance. Imandra‚Äôs tools, such as Code Logician, promise to slash error-prone processes with ‚Äúmathematical guarantees,‚Äù according to the startup. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can astound with human-like conversation and research superpowers, but it can also be disastrously wrong. That unreliability is a major barrier to adoption as AI begins to control physical machines, payments and other high-stakes domains.

Œî Neurosymbolic AI is a rising technique that aims to solve the hallucination problem. It‚Äôs a hybrid approach that marries gen AI‚Äôs neural networks for pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning‚Äôs logic that can prove whether outputs are correct, with mathematical precision. The goal is to maintain the flexibility of generative AI while making its outputs trustworthy. Trust is a key factor for greater adoption of generative and agentic AI, according to a July 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report. While chief financial officers (CFOs) have warmed up to generative AI, they are still unsure whether they could trust agentic AI. Just 15% of executives are considering deployment. Neurosymbolic AI could help. Its roots stem from the early 20th century, when mathematicians developed ways to formalize reasoning using symbolic logic, laying the foundation of modern computing. Out of that tradition grew automated reasoning, a subset of symbolic reasoning that uses logic to prove the correctness of computer programs. Amazon has become one of neurosymbolic AI‚Äôs most prominent adopters, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its Automated Reasoning Group, founded more than a decade ago, built tools to verify security policies in the AWS cloud. Those methods now underpin new systems such as the Vulcan warehouse robots, which combine neural networks for perception with automated reasoning for precise planning. Amazon also applies neurosymbolic AI to customer-facing products. The Rufus shopping assistant, for example, uses large language models for conversation but leans on automated reasoning to ensure recommendations align with rules and policies. In August, Amazon announced an automated reasoning feature to minimize hallucinations, claiming it can identify correct model responses with up to 99% accuracy. ‚ÄúThis is emblematic of where the field is going,‚Äù Imandra Co-founder and co-CEO Grant Passmore said in an interview with PYMNTS. ‚ÄúFundamentally, just large language models on their own cannot be trusted to reliably reason. On the other hand, you have this incredible and hitherto underutilized field of AI ‚Äî which is automated reasoning ‚Äî completely built on logic, completely precise‚Äù and independently audited. See also: The Two Faces of AI: Gen AI‚Äôs Triumph Meets Agentic AI‚Äôs Caution Amazon‚Äôs automated reasoning group was founded by Byron Cook, its former distinguished scientist. About 20 years ago, he and Passmore crossed paths at Cambridge University in the U.K. In 2014, Passmore and Co-founder and Co-CEO Denis Ignatovich ‚Äî a college friend who ran Deutsche Bank‚Äôs equities trading desk in London ‚Äî founded Imandra to apply neurosymbolic logic to finance. Ignatovich‚Äôs constant concern was that a developer working on the trading system could inadvertently omit a line of code that causes the system to violate a regulation ‚Äî and it becoming a big issue. At the time, Passmore was working on new techniques for reasoning in the U.K. ‚ÄúWe realized we could actually commercialize this stuff,‚Äù Passmore said. ‚ÄúFinance needs it. Financial regulators need it, and finance can pay for it.‚Äù Founded in 2014 and incorporated in the U.S. in 2019, Imandra has raised $23 million from investors including Citi, Green Visor Capital, Albion, IQ Capital and Austin‚Äôs LiveOak Venture Partners. Goldman Sachs is a client, and Citi led its most recent round. One use case is automating the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol, which lets organizations send electronic trading instructions to each other, say from Goldman Sachs to BlackRock or the New York Stock Exchange. ‚ÄúEvery computer in capital markets trading uses a version of this protocol, but everybody is allowed to customize it,‚Äù Passmore said. Typically, these quirks are described in 100-page PDFs. To connect, companies had to interpret the manual, build their own client code and then test repeatedly to make sure both sides can connect without errors. Imandra built a mathematically precise language for specifying the FIX protocol. Instead of relying on hundreds of pages of PDFs, clients can now use automated reasoning to ensure precise communication each way. ‚ÄúThis very error-prone process at the plumbing level of the markets used to take sometimes upwards of six months‚Äù for a new participant to be onboarded, Passmore said. ‚ÄúNow they can be onboarded within three days with mathematical guarantees.‚Äù To scale its approach, Imandra launched Imandra Universe, a platform it describes as the first marketplace for neurosymbolic agents. Similar to Hugging Face‚Äôs repository for machine learning models, it hosts symbolic reasoning engines specialized in domains from geometry to logistics. A ‚ÄúReasoner Gateway‚Äù lets developers plug them into agent frameworks, augmenting AI systems with logical checks. One flagship tool, Code Logician, targets the flood of AI-generated code. Once installed in coding assistants like Cursor, Code Logician builds a mathematical description of what the AI generated code is doing and use Imandra to verify it. Passmore said around 60% of AI-generated code contains bugs and Code Logician can make 96% of the code correct within three iterations. Imandra is expanding Code Logician beyond Python to Java and even COBOL, reflecting enterprise demand for code migration. It is also developing agents for geometry reasoning, among other pursuits.

Title: Exclusive: Anthony Scaramucci‚Äôs SkyBridge Capital to tokenize $300 million on Avalanche
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/08/19/anthony-scaramucci-skybridge-capital-tokenization-avalanche/

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another investment firm is putting funds on the blockchain. Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, announced Tuesday that his company plans to hold around $300 million from two funds in the form of tokenized assets. SkyBridge‚Äôs move comes amid a wave of enthusiasm for what the crypto industry calls tokenization. The process entails creating digital token versions of real-world assets like Treasury bills, which can be easily traded on a blockchain in the same way as Bitcoin or stablecoins. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm basically seeing 2026 into 2027 as the age of real-world tokenization,‚Äù Scaramucci, a former Goldman Sachs executive who had a brief stint at the White House during President Donald Trump‚Äôs first term, told Fortune. SkyBridge Capital plans to deploy its tokenized funds on Avalanche, a blockchain that boasts almost $2 billion in assets on its network, according to crypto analytics provider DefiLlama. The amount of money that SkyBridge will deploy is about 10% of his firm‚Äôs assets under management, Scaramucci told Fortune. One of the two funds he‚Äôs tokenizing specializes in investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have not been deemed securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to SkyBridge‚Äôs most recent investor disclosure. The other is a fund of funds composed of SkyBridge‚Äôs other investment vehicles, including both its venture and crypto funds. Advocates say issuing products like investment funds on decentralized networks can reduce transaction fees and cut out middlemen. Traditionally, there are a series of individuals between the buyers and sellers of financial assets, each of whom has to vet and evaluate the origin of, say, a stake in a fund‚Äîeven if that fund is made up of cryptocurrencies already on blockchains. Each of these middlemen can charge fees and slow the process down. Blockchains are decentralized databases, meaning that no one party can tamper with the information stored on the network. Hence, there theoretically does not need to be a middleman to verify the owner and authenticity of a financial asset issued on it. Users can look up the details themselves. While proponents have lauded the virtues of tokenization for some time, the business of putting real-world assets on blockchains is still nascent, though it appears to be gaining momentum. Financial heavyweights like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck have recently issued their own money-market funds onto a series of blockchains like Solana and Aptos. Eventually, advocates envision a world where investors can buy and transfer their stakes in various funds without having to wade through spreadsheets or repeated calls to banks to wire money. SkyBridge Capital plans to partner with Tokeny, a company that specializes in tokenization, to put its funds on Avalanche. ‚ÄúUltimately, we want to achieve two things,‚Äù said John Wu, the president of Ava Labs, one of the main developers behind the Avalanche network. ‚ÄúOne is to bring activity on chain from the traditional finance world and also show the world that this technology can benefit them in terms of cost savings.‚Äù ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Figure‚Äôs IPO filing marks Mike Cagney‚Äôs return to public markets

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Figure Technology, a 7-year-old blockchain-based lending company, on Monday filed for an IPO of its Class A common stock on Nasdaq, saying in its IPO paperwork that its revenue rose 22.4% to $191 million in the six months ended June 30, and that it reported a profit of $29 million in the same period, compared with a loss of $13 million a year earlier. The filing offers a chance at vindication for Figure co-founder Mike Cagney, who previously built SoFi before leaving the personal finance platform in 2017 following sexual harassment allegations. SoFi went public in 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger and has done pretty well as a public company ‚Äî its stock is up over 200% in the past year, and its revenue rose 44% in the second quarter of 2025. Since its founding in 2018, Figure has established itself as one of the bigger players in blockchain-based lending, claiming more than 160 partners for its loan origination system and capital marketplace. Figure claims to be the largest non-bank provider of home equity lines of credit. The company, which Cagney founded with his wife June Ou, uses blockchain technology through its Provenance blockchain to speed along approvals for home equity loans, mortgage refinancing, and student and personal loans. In May, Figure said it was also expanding into cryptocurrency lending, signing a financing agreement with Victory Park Capital for what Figure described as the industry‚Äôs first securitized pool of crypto-backed loans. That product allows asset owners to borrow against their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings with loan-to-value ratios up to 75%. Terms of that deal with Victory Park were not disclosed. Cagney has a history of ambitious regulatory moves. As TechCrunch reported in late 2020, during the last days of the first Trump administration, Figure applied for a U.S. national bank charter that would have let it accept uninsured deposits exceeding $250,000 from accredited investors while avoiding traditional FDIC and Federal Reserve oversight. The approach could have established a template for other fintech and retail companies to obtain non-traditional bank charters and offer lucrative financial products while avoiding such oversight, but Figure withdrew its application last year amid broader fintech industry challenges. The company has undergone major leadership and organizational changes in the meantime. In April 2024, Figure appointed Michael Tannenbaum, former COO of Brex, as CEO. Tannenbaum previously worked with Cagney as SoFi‚Äôs chief revenue officer. And in an unusual corporate maneuver, Cagney spun off Figure Markets in early 2024, creating a standalone digital asset exchange for crypto trading, crypto-backed loans, and stablecoins. But just over a year later, in July, Figure reversed course and smooshed the two entities back together. The company says the strategy positions it to capture a huge and growing opportunity in real-world asset tokenization. (Real-world asset tokenization involves converting traditional assets like mortgages, real estate, or loans ‚Äî even art ‚Äî into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain networks. Heavyweight financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are among those who have recently entered the space.) It‚Äôs worth noting that this is not Figure‚Äôs first attempt at going public. The company previously planned to list via a merger with a SPAC called Figure Acquisition Corp., but the deal got scrapped due to rising interest rates and redemption rates, among other challenges. The blank check company was later delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Figure, whose backers include Apollo Global Management and Ribbit Capital, also failed to complete a planned merger with mortgage lender Homebridge Financial Services in 2022, citing regulatory delays 10 months after the tie-up was announced. The IPO filing is no surprise to industry observers. For one, Figure ‚Äî which last raised $200 million in 2021 at a $3.2 billion valuation ‚Äî announced weeks ago that it had filed a confidential statement for an IPO. Further, the timing aligns with a growing wave of crypto-related companies seeking public listings, encouraged by the wildly successful debut of Circle Internet Group back in June, and the Trump administration‚Äôs full-bodied support for the cryptocurrency sector and related legislation. Circle‚Äôs shares soared more than 500% in their first two weeks on the public market. Crypto exchange Bullish has added to the momentum as its shares more than doubled on its first day of trading last week. On Friday, the Winklevoss twins‚Äô crypto exchange Gemini filed for an IPO despite reporting a $282.5 million net loss in the first half of 2025. Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and BofA Securities are serving as the lead bookrunners for Figure‚Äôs IPO. The number of shares to be offered and their price range have not yet been determined.

Title: Why yearslong bear market slumps may be a thing of the past

Probably no other term strikes the kind of fear into investors that "bear market" does. The phrase invokes imagery of the 2008 financial crisis, the dot-com bust in 2000, and the 1929 crash leading into the Great Depression. In all of those cases, wealth evaporated in months and wasn't rebuilt for years. But is there really that much to fear anymore when it comes to bear markets, or declines of at least 20%? Sure, no one likes a significant market pullback, but if you stay invested, there's evidence that they may not be all that painful ‚Äî and that the long, drawn-out, yearslong ruts in the market may be a thing of the past. That's according to Hank Smith, the director and head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust, which manages and consults on $15.3 billion of assets. In a recent interview with Business Insider, Smith laid out the main reason bear markets might be more short-lived going forward: A significant imbalance in the supply of shares on the market and demand for them. A few decades ago, the number of publicly listed firms in the US was over 7,000, he said. Now it's under 4,000. This number has also been shrinking relative to the US population. There are about 13 publicly listed companies per million people today, compared to 30 companies in 1996. At the same time, there is a record amount of cash ‚Äî $7 trillion in money market funds ‚Äî on the sidelines, he said. What's more, stock buybacks have been generally on the rise, lowering the supply of stocks available for investors to buy. In the first quarter of this year, there were $55.3 billion in stock buybacks. In the first quarter of 2019, by comparison, that number was $12.8 billion. In the first quarter of 2000, there were $7.9 billion. When there are fewer stocks available to be traded, prices tend to be more volatile. "There's been a real reduction in many companies of their shares outstanding," Smith said. "I think that's a big reason why you don't get these elongated periods of two to three years to recover from a bear market." He added: "It really is the result of supply and demand. I don't think it's much more complicated than that." Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said last week that this is the "best investing environment ever" partly due to this dynamic. "Technicals in equities are crazy," Rieder said in an interview with CNBC. "The demand versus supply is pretty extraordinary. " Alex Morris, the chief investment officer at F/M Investments, also recently discussed supply and demand dynamics with Business Insider. Despite a laundry list of risks to stocks ‚Äî including the impact of tariffs and high valuations ‚Äî the insatiable demand from investors for stocks likely means the market will continue marching higher, he said. "There's a lot of dollars floating around and they need to go somewhere," he said. "They're going to the equity market." While the sample size is small, there are a couple of pieces of evidence supporting Smith's theory, he said: the 2020 and 2022 market crashes, when the market fell 35% and 25%, respectively. In each instance, the market regained fresh all-time highs in a year or less. Of course, there were other factors at play, like unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in 2020 and the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. "This isn't like bear markets a generation or two ago that sometimes it took years to get back to the highwater mark," Smith said. "These bear markets are followed by very, very swift, powerful bull moves." Jump to

Russian president Vladimir Putin wants to hold as much territory as possible. Photo: AP Just imagine this scenario. An aggravated burglary has taken place and your children and belongings have been taken. The leader of the pack agrees to stop assaulting you ‚Äì if you let them keep what they have already taken. They may consider permitting you to install enhanced security measures in the future. Incidentally, life is hell for Ukrainians in Crimea. ‚ÄúSpecial measures‚Äù and tribunals have been set up to deal with any dissent. How did we get it so wrong? Daniel Smith, Blackrock, Co Dublin America is winning the war in Ukraine. Russia spends 7.1pc of its GDP on defence, double the US level. Russia has suffered a million casualties; the US arms industry is booming as Europe re-arms. Nato is buying US equipment to send to Ukraine. Russia has lost half its foreign income from oil and gas. The longer the war goes on, the more Russia is weakened and America is strengthened. John Doherty, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dh√∫n na nGall Reports of Donald Trump‚Äôs Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, conducted not over hard diplomacy but filet mignon, halibut Olympia and green salad, ought to chill Europe more than amuse it. What is at stake is not the menu, but the spectacle of two men deciding the fate of Ukraine without Ukraine present (‚ÄòAs Trump bows to Putin, Europe must prepare for the worst‚Äô, Irish Independent, August 18). The wider danger lies in the precedent. If borders and sovereignty can be redrawn in a dinner meeting, international law is reduced to table talk. The extrapolation is clear: once this becomes an acceptable mode of negotiation, other authoritarian leaders will be emboldened to test the same weakness. The prediction is bleaker still. A Ukraine carved up in Alaska may be only the first course. Moldova, the Baltics, even Taiwan, could follow as Moscow and Beijing take note of Washington‚Äôs willingness to appease under the guise of expedience. Europe, then, must prepare for the worst. To dine with Putin is one thing; to digest his terms is quite another. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Watching world politicians waffling reminds me of what the British parliamentarian Pitt the Elder said: ‚ÄúThere is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.‚Äù John Finegan, Bailieborough, Co Cavan The recent death of actor Terence Stamp reminds me of his wonderful performance in the movie Far From The Madding Crowd. Sad indeed that fellow actors in that movie, Peter Finch and Alan Bates are also since departed. It‚Äôs nice to note that the female lead, Julie Christie, is hale and hearty at 85. Indeed by his own admission, singer Tony Christie was so impressed by her, that he adopted her surname. Is there a greater compliment? Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Fionn√°n Sheahan writes that should former minister Heather Humphreys decide to enter the race for the √Åras, she might be called on to explain ‚Äúwhy she stepped away from politics‚Äù recently (‚ÄòHeather Humphreys is a better candidate but Simon Harris is a liability to campaign‚Äô, Irish Independent, August 18). One thing is certain, the response from the Monaghan woman will be straight and true. The office of president is ‚Äúabove politics‚Äù. And rightly so. Though there are those who have lost the run of themselves while holding high office, causing no end of concern for our ‚Äúordinary‚Äù political masters, as well as for the people they represent. Another contender, it‚Äôs been widely reported, has expressed ‚Äúdistrust‚Äù of the UK, France and Germany ¬≠recently. Not a great start for an aspiring head of State. The incumbent has been known to ‚Äúcross the constitutional boundary‚Äù more than once during his almost 14 years in the Phoenix Park. Let‚Äôs hope the next holder of the ‚Äúhighest office‚Äù maintains some apolitical equilibrium, save for those times that necessitate presidential intervention. Peter Declan O‚ÄôHalloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan It was worrying reading last week that a study found that for under-18s with eating disorders there was a 121pc rise in hospitalisations between 2018 and 2022 ‚Äì from 170 admissions in 2018 to 375 in 2022 ‚Äì with a sharp spike during the pandemic. Eating disorders are complex ¬≠medical conditions that not only affect the young person concerned but also their loved ones, family and friends. It strikes me that wraparound care is essential, requiring an increase in investment at a national level. Not every treatment will work successfully for every person that presents at a hospital, or is diagnosed with an eating disorder. If any reader, or professional working with young people, wants an insight into this issue, I strongly recommend Evanna Lynch‚Äôs memoir: The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting. It is a harrowing, haunting, honest and unflinching account, and yet a beautifully crafted read that reflects the author‚Äôs own journey with an eating disorder that she ultimately overcomes. Let us hope these figures do not continue to rise. Stephen O‚ÄôHara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo The recent attacks on members of the Indian community are abhorrent. They are also, as noted by many commentators, puzzling, as the ¬≠Indian community continues to ¬≠contribute so much to Irish society. The fact that they are puzzling does not make them more abhorrent. All racist attacks are abhorrent, regardless of whether the target community contributes economically or not. Chants of ‚ÄúGet them Out‚Äù at anti-immigration protests may legitimise and encourage these appalling attacks. We all need to be careful with our language and not tolerate any racism, taunts, slurs or ‚Äújokes‚Äù.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin Adoption Grows But Success Comes With Risks
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4335366/posts
Time Published: 2025-08-19T03:33:53Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/18/2025 8:33:53 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Quote of the week: ‚ÄúBitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.‚Äù - Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we‚Äôre going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it‚Äôs an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it‚Äôs sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let‚Äôs start with what‚Äôs changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here‚Äôs what has happened so far: üè¶ Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search General/Chat Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we‚Äôre going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it‚Äôs an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it‚Äôs sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let‚Äôs start with what‚Äôs changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here‚Äôs what has happened so far: üè¶ Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search General/Chat Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we‚Äôre going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it‚Äôs an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it‚Äôs sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let‚Äôs start with what‚Äôs changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here‚Äôs what has happened so far: üè¶ Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Let‚Äôs start with what‚Äôs changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here‚Äôs what has happened so far: üè¶ Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week!

Here‚Äôs what has happened so far: üè¶ Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they‚Äôre allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). üå¨Ô∏è Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. üìú Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ‚è≥ What‚Äôs pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was ‚Äúproceed with caution‚Äù . Today, with all the above changes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcome on in, the water‚Äôs fine.‚ÄùAnd investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things.

This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. üìà ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search General/Chat Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson According to Bloomberg‚Äôs ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp‚Äôs podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

Free Republic Browse ¬∑ Search General/Chat Topics ¬∑ Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson üë∂ IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it‚Äôs like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. üí∏ IBIT is BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it‚Äôs BlackRock‚Äôs most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. ü•à Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. üè¢ >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin‚Äôs accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ‚ö†Ô∏è The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of ‚Äúqualified custodians‚Äù to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight.

Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ‚ú® The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market‚Äôs bitcoin, you‚Äôve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn‚Äôt FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn‚Äôt be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn‚Äôt these custodians' first rodeo, and they‚Äôve taken many measures to minimise them, including: üîí Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. üè¶ Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‚Äëparty approval workflows, SOC‚Äëaudited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. üí° The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it‚Äôs ‚Äúmarket neutral‚Äù (Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they‚Äôre held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting.

Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios.

So if you‚Äôre also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile.

If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they‚Äôre wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1‚Äì3% position is not catastrophic.

Œî UBS strategists wrote this in a Monday (Aug. 18) note in which they said private credit lenders are becoming an important source of capital for the industry, Bloomberg reported Monday. Private debt loaned to the technology sector increased by $100 billion over the past 12 months, reaching a total of $450 billion, while business development companies‚Äô tech lending leapt from $80 billion to $150 billion, the UBS note said, per the report. The demand for this capital is driven by tech companies‚Äô spending on AI data center construction and other AI development costs, according to the report. ‚ÄúThis phenomenon could sustain significant growth plans for AI and other hyperscaler companies, sowing the seeds of an upside scenario and increasing overheating risk,‚Äù the UBS strategists led by Matthew Mish wrote in the note, per the report. Microsoft said in a July 30 earnings report that its capital expenditures are projected to exceed $30 billion in the first quarter to meet the rising infrastructure needs driven by strong demand for cloud and AI. During the fiscal year ended June 30, Microsoft opened new data centers across six continents and now has more than 400 facilities in 70 regions. ‚ÄúWe continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,‚Äù Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a July 30 earnings call. PYMNTS reported July 15 that Google, Meta, Blackstone and Coreweave are planning to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI data centers, as the arms race heats up to build the computing power needed by this advanced technology. A month earlier, AWS said it would spend at least $20 billion to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in Pennsylvania. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX. Microsoft and BlackRock launched the fund last year to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities.

August 18, 2025 16:50 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (Nasdaq: FFAI) (‚ÄúFF‚Äù, ‚ÄúFaraday Future‚Äù, or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced its financial results for its second quarter 2025. The Company highlighted several key metrics that underscore both the operational execution and financial position, as well as its significant progress in its FX brand and product development. The Company also provided an update on subsequent events, FX Super One MPV reveal, ‚ÄúEAI + Crypto‚Äù Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy, and its outlook for the remainder of 2025. SUMMARY The Company made meaningful progress in operations, strengthened its business and financial fundamentals, and advanced the strategic execution of its AI-driven mobility roadmap. FF held its first FX vehicle launch event by unveiling two groundbreaking global-first products, the FX Super One EAI-MPV and the FF Super EAI F.A.C.E. System, alongside the FF EAI Embodied AI Agent 6x4 Architecture, in Los Angeles on July 17, 2025. The non-binding reservations for the FX Super One topped 4,000 units by the end of the quarter, and increased to over 10,000 units as of July 31, 2025, suggesting strong potential demand for this vehicle, underscoring the effectiveness of the B2B2C co-creation sales model, and reaffirming FF‚Äôs mass-market strategy. FF also received recognition from Mariah Carey, the best-selling female artist of all time, by including both the FF 91 2.0 and the FFZERO1 concept car in her latest music video, and who will become a new owner of the FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance. FF‚Äôs Hanford plant has completed production and delivery of the FF91 P20 model and continues with subsequent vehicle production. Additionally, FX Super One has officially entered the parts procurement and production preparation phase at the Hanford factory, moving into trial production. Additionally, the Company officially released version 2.00.58 of FF 91 via OTA, completed FMVSS testing for FX, and submitted a patent registration for the Super One EAI-Face product. The Company looks to supercharge its workforce by adding additional jobs in the coming years, as it plans to ramp up its new FX vehicle program, which is targeted to begin assembly in Hanford by the end of 2025. This development will enable the delivery of high-quality career opportunities. Additionally, Faraday Future plans to invest an additional approximately $100 million into its U.S. operations in the next 9-12 months, with commitments to research and development, and infrastructure, subject to securing the necessary financing. In capital and investor relations, FF was added to the Russell 3000 Index‚Äîa key milestone that enhances FF‚Äôs visibility and credibility among institutional investors, analysts, and the broader market. Top-tier international fund managers, Vanguard and BlackRock, continued to increase their holdings in FFAI, with both firms growing their positions by over 500% by June 30, 2025, compared to Q4 2024. Internally, FF launched and started executing its 10b5-1 executive stock purchase plans, reflecting FF executives‚Äô personal commitment to the company‚Äôs future and aim to align management‚Äôs interests with stockholders. FF also secured approximately $105 million in new cash financing commitments, subject to certain closing conditions, which will support the launch of FX Super One, and accelerate development and distribution efforts for the FF and FX brands and AI-related technologies. FF also achieved a key milestone in the Middle East during the second quarter by completing the handover ceremony for FF‚Äôs new facility in Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, further advancing FF‚Äôs presence across the Middle East and North Africa region. On the operational side, FF strengthened its execution by welcoming back its Founder, YT Jia, who rejoined the Company this past quarter as Co-CEO. His leadership will further drive both operational and capital fundamentals while reinforcing market confidence. In addition, FF implemented continuous improvement measures across the Company, which have already delivered significant results in cost reduction, efficiency gains, and streamlined operations. RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2025 In summary, the quarter reflects measured progress in advancing financial discipline and operational execution. FF continues to allocate resources to its most critical priorities, while managing capital effectively and maintaining flexibility for long-term growth. Efforts to better align expenses with current business needs have strengthened the foundation for future stability and financial stability. Additionally, the global unveiling of the FX Super One on July 17, 2025, is an important step in advancing FF‚Äôs strategic roadmap. The Company held an event in Pebble Beach on August 16, where it introduced its Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. A central component of this strategy is the Company‚Äôs new C10 Treasury product, which establishes a direct connection between real-world business operations and on-chain assets. As one of the first U.S.-listed companies to introduce this capability, FF is creating a new growth paradigm by bridging Web2 and Web3. The C10 Treasury product is expected to strengthen the Company‚Äôs financial and technological foundation while reinforcing its ability to drive innovation across both ecosystems. Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer, spoke highly of the event by delivering the opening speech. 2025 OUTLOOK For the second half of 2025, FF will continue to focus on driving technological innovation, maintaining financial discipline, and driving long-term growth and success in the EV market. The Company expects to hit the FX year-end off-line target in the U.S. and anticipate the first FX Super One will roll off the production line in the Middle East by the end of the year as well. FF will continue to execute on the Company‚Äôs seven tier-one strategic goals and pillars, from S1 to S7, and uphold the ‚ÄúShareholders First‚Äù philosophy by putting all its efforts towards building trust with investors and fully regaining their confidence. ‚ÄúIn the second quarter, we achieved several notable capital markets milestones and also continued to strengthen our operating efficiencies and cost control measures,‚Äù said Matthias Aydt, Global Co-CEO of Faraday Future. ‚ÄúWe are excited for many of our recent developments as well, including the recent FX Super One unveiling in LA on July 17 as well as the success of our recent Pebble Beach event on August 16, where we introduced our Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. FX continues to build strong momentum with its innovative B2B and B2C sales model, and we are encouraged by the early pre-order numbers for the FX Super One.‚Äù EARNINGS WEBCAST Faraday Future management will host a webcast today, August 18, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time (5:00 p.m. Pacific time).

(Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." Even before President Donald Trump‚Äôs reelection, investors were leaving the woke environmental, social, and governance agenda like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Yet, those rats appear to have a few life rafts remaining, and the World Economic Forum seems intent on shoring up the ESG agenda. The World Economic Forum is a conspiracy theorist‚Äôs wet dream. The forum hosts the annual Davos gathering of world leaders in Switzerland. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the forum‚Äôs founder and chairman, Klaus Schwab, wrote ‚ÄúCOVID-19: The Great Reset,‚Äù a manual for using the pandemic crisis to upend all of society. The forum also promoted the prediction ‚ÄúYou will own nothing and be happy.‚Äù This nonprofit organization, supported by 1,000 member multinational companies, represents the woke managerial elite. The World Economic Forum supports the claims that climate change poses a catastrophic threat to humanity, that institutions must be altered to root out ‚Äúsystemic racism,‚Äù and that society must be upended to kowtow to the demands of men who claim to identify as women and vice versa. It uses the notion of ‚Äústakeholder capitalism‚Äù to say that a company‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt just to provide a return on investment for shareholders, but to make the world a better‚Äîread ‚Äúmore woke‚Äù‚Äîplace. Meat will be a special treat. Read more: https://t.co/RiQP6tpkfp pic.twitter.com/7BcRHgnWTx The elites pushing these agendas brand those who disagree as ‚Äúreactionary‚Äù or ‚Äúhateful.‚Äù Yet, the World Economic Forum faced its own problems. Whistleblowers filed a complaint after The Wall Street Journal published an investigation claiming the Forum‚Äôs culture was hostile to female and black employees. Schwab, the founder, stepped down in April amid an investigation into claims he had misused Forum funds. This turmoil may have represented an opportunity for the World Economic Forum to chart a new course, rejecting its woke bureaucratic mentality and listening to the worldwide populist movement. It‚Äôs not just Trump: Populism is growing in France, Germany, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands, and beyond. Businesses are also rejecting ESG. A host of companies have pulled out of the Corporate Equality Index maintained by the Human Rights Campaign, which has acted like a kind of LGBTQ+ mafia. Corporate America is outwardly rejecting the language of ‚Äúdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äù after Trump rightly issued executive orders interpreting racial quotas as a form of illegal discrimination. Yet the World Economic Forum is rejecting the anti-woke trend. Not only did the forum give its founder an outgoing commendation, but it also tapped the man who has long been the face of the ESG movement to help steer the ship. In a statement Friday, the forum said it concluded ‚Äúthere is no substantial evidence of material wrongdoing‚Äù from Schwab or his wife, Hilde Schwab. ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment, rather than intent of misconduct,‚Äù the World Economic Forum concluded. It also announced that Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a former chief executive of Nestle who served as the interim chairman of the board, would be stepping down. Two men replaced him as co-chairs of the board: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Swiss billionaire Andr√© Hoffmann. Fink has long been the face of ESG. Under his leadership, BlackRock committed to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in March 2021, pledging to offset its greenhouse gas emissions completely by 2050. His 2021 letter praised as ‚Äúprotests for racial justice‚Äù the Black Lives Matter protests that had devolved into riots in the summer of 2020. He said, ‚ÄúNo organization is immune from the challenges posed by racial bias.‚Äù Fink has attempted to walk back some of this activism in recent years, as his firm faced backlash not just from conservatives, but from state treasurers who moved to withdraw state investment funds from BlackRock. As far back as 2023, Fink stopped using the term ESG, claiming it had been ‚Äúweaponized.‚Äù BlackRock deleted DEI statements in its latest annual report. The company exited the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition earlier this year, while claiming that the move would not alter ‚Äúthe way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.‚Äù BlackRock is not giving up on climate alarmism, however. It has shifted from ESG to ‚Äútransition investing,‚Äù directing funds to companies that aim to operate using smaller amounts of carbon-based fuel. Furthermore, BlackRock still has a 100% score with the Human Rights Campaign. If Fink were truly committed to leaving ESG in the past, BlackRock would separate from the Human Rights Campaign and abandon climate alarmism. Like Fink, Hoffmann has embraced the ‚Äústakeholder capitalism‚Äù model and combined it with climate alarmism. The drug company Roche Holding, where Hoffman serves as vice chairman, published an interview with Hoffman in 2022 titled ‚ÄúNo one can deny the existence of climate change.‚Äù In that interview, Hoffman said, ‚ÄúRoche employees have to know that we aren‚Äôt here just to make money; we are here to help people in a sustainable, lasting way,‚Äù such that the company grows ‚Äúin harmony with nature and society.‚Äù As the world increasingly moves on from ESG, the World Economic Forum is doubling down. The woke movement may be on the outs for now, but the threat it poses isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. Today, even with President Trump‚Äôs victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal‚Äôs own Tyler O‚ÄôNeil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O‚ÄôNeil reveals how the Left‚Äôs NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) ‚Äî CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ruled out the likelihood of the controversial sale of its global ports to a BlackRock Inc.-backed consortium being completed this year but stayed optimistic about the deal‚Äôs prospects after inviting a Chinese investor into the mix. A transaction wouldn‚Äôt be completed this year even if binding agreements are settled sooner, said CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt at an analysts briefing following the release of its interim earnings results on Thursday. He pointed out the complexity involved in the deal, which covers 43 of CK Hutchison‚Äôs ports including two in the strategic Panama Canal. If completed, the sale could net the conglomerate founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing more than $19 billion in cash. ‚ÄúWe are in a new stage of our deal and that includes, as we have said, discussions with a major strategic Chinese investor,‚Äù Sixt said. ‚ÄúI believe that there is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included, and most importantly, that will be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.‚Äù The comments came amid uncertainties over the fate of the geopolitically fraught deal, which has become a proxy for the rivalry between the US and China. While President Donald Trump hailed the sale as a win over the Panama waterway, Beijing has expressed strong displeasure over the sale, seeing it as a betrayal to the nation and kowtowing to American pressure. CK Hutchison shares swung between gains and losses in early trading on Friday, after first-half results released Thursday showed profit plunged 92% due to a one-time, non-cash loss from a merger. Through Thursday‚Äôs close, the shares had added 25% this year. The company has already missed a chance to ink a definitive agreement before a window for exclusive talks with the buying consortium expired in late July. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the buying consortium, which also includes Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte‚Äôs Terminal Investment Ltd., people familiar with the matter have said. While the discussions have taken longer than expected, the group doesn‚Äôt see it as particularly troublesome because the port operations have been performing well this year, Sixt said. The company reported a 9% increase in revenue at its ports and related services business for the first half of the year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 10%, mainly due to higher throughput and storage income in regions including mainland China, Asia, the Middle East, Mexico and Europe. ¬© 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

US market dominance and Ethereum's impressive gains highlight the evolving crypto investment landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products pulled in $3.75 billion in net inflows last week, marking one of the largest weekly gains in history, according to CoinShares latest weekly report. The renewed appetite follows several weeks of tepid market sentiment and coincides with a recent crypto price rally. Notably, these inflows lifted total assets under management (AuM) to a fresh record of $244 billion. Ethereum emerged as the clear leader in the market, drawing $2.87 billion in inflows, about 77% of the weekly total. James Butterfill, CoinShares‚Äô Head of Research, noted that most of last week‚Äôs inflows concentrated in BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum fund (ETHA), which accounted for over $2.3 billion of the fresh capital in the funds. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF and manages over $10 billion in assets, according to SoSo Value data. The BlackRock fund‚Äôs record performance has contributed significantly to ETH-focused funds‚Äô accumulation of a record $11 billion in new capital this year. Conversely, Bitcoin-focused funds have repeatedly seen smaller flows in recent weeks, highlighting the shift in investor interest toward Ethereum. This was unchanged last week when the BTC-focused funds registered $522 million in new capital. Notably, CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum‚Äôs YTD inflows now represent 29% of its AuM, far outpacing Bitcoin‚Äôs 11.6%. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the largest asset in terms of AuM, standing at $180.7 billion compared to Ethereum‚Äôs $37.7 billion. Meanwhile, short Bitcoin products saw $4 million in inflows as prices dipped below $120,000, triggering significant losses for leveraged long traders. Outside of the top two major cryptocurrencies, XRP and Solana continue to remain the top altcoin pick for institutional investors. Last week, funds focused on these digital assets registered over $300 million in combined fresh capital. This brings their year-to-date flows to over $2 billion, and their funds also manage more than $5 billion in assets. Regionally, the United States accounted for nearly all of the inflows, contributing $3.73 billion, around 99% of the total. Other markets recorded smaller gains, including Canada with $33.7 million, Hong Kong with $20.9 million, and Australia with $12.1 million. However, these gains were partially offset by outflows from Sweden and Brazil, which saw $49.9 million and $10.6 million withdrawn, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The TeX Factor For Traditional And Digital Asset Businesses
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuasmeltzer/2025/08/18/the-tex-factor-for-traditional-and-digital-asset-businesses/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T13:00:00Z

ByJoshua D. Smeltzer ByJoshua D. Smeltzer, Contributor. Full disclosure, I‚Äôm an adopted Texan. I wasn‚Äôt born or raised in Texas, but my family and I moved from Washington, D.C. in 2007 and I have called it home ever since. Although this fact may, reasonably, color my views, it has been a remarkable place to watch economic growth and the adoption of the digital asset economy. In general, Texas has always been a business-friendly environment. However, a series of recent moves by Texas lawmakers shows a deliberate effort to establish a business and, specifically, a digital asset business destination. Texas has embraced digital asset innovation - Bitcoin mining, financial services, and Web3, as well as blockchain and associated other companies in this new and growing industry. Most recently, Texas established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin reserve which allows the investment of public funds into digital assets. As expected, this will be managed by the Texas Comptroller. This creates a very conducive environment for digital asset and other traditional companies. Another significant step in making Texas a catalyst for economic growth is the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) that intends to open in 2026. Texas is proving that southern hospitality extends not only to the people who visit, but to businesses as well. Full disclosure, again, I‚Äôm a litigator handling corporate, tax, white-collar, and other financial disputes. Although inherently disruptive, litigation is sometimes the only way for parties to resolve disputes and be able to carry on their respective business. Even with the best. Texas has legislated a two-phase approach: creating laws that will reduce disputes and also creating specific courts. The intention is to allow for a more streamlined approach to resolving complex business disputes outside of the regular state court system. On May 14, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 into law that immediately became effective. The legislation codified the ‚Äúbusiness judgment rule‚Äù which created a presumption that the directors and officers of corporations acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in furtherance of the interests of the corporation, and in obedience to the law and the corporation‚Äôs governing documents when taking action on matters of the corporation‚Äôs business. In order to establish a cause of action the corporation or its shareholders must rebut these presumptions and prove a breach of their duties involving fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act (i.e. outside scope of powers), or a knowing violation of law. Senate Bill 29 also codified the right of a Texas entity to include a provision in its operating documents waiving a right to a jury for any ‚Äúinternal entity claims.‚Äù In a new and developing industry, especially one based on new technologies like Distributed Ledger Technology and other technology related to digital assets, directors and officer are more likely to exercise ‚Äúbusiness judgment‚Äù on how to operate and grow the company. If that judgment is subject to easy lawsuits second-guessing hard choices, or using hindsight analysis, it can hold back innovative decision-making or paralyze a growing company while it waits for lengthy litigation to conclude. The new law allows the governing documents to require that internal entity claims be brought in Texas courts, including the newly established Texas Business Courts. The Texas Business Court is a statewide, specialized trial court created to resolve certain complex business disputes. The Texas Business Courts opened on September 1, 2024 with the judges appointed by the governor for a two-year term (instead of elected). The law required that these judges must have had at least 10 years of practice in civil business litigation, business transaction law, or service as a civil judge. The new courts have limited jurisdiction (e.g. larger amounts in controversy, specific issues such as corporate governance, etc.) which means a smaller docket of cases and the presumption of faster resolution. Since the business courts are still relatively new, it will take time to determine exactly what types of business disputes benefit from this specialization. All eyes are on Texas to determine if time is saved by the smaller, more specialized, caseload. Backed by financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has the funding to create a pro-business, innovation-friendly alternative to traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. TXSE is, of course, focused on traditional financial products but has the opportunity to differentiate itself as a digital asset focused exchange. BlackRock runs popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the presumption that similar products will be offered on TXSE. Also, publicly traded companies involved in Bitcoin mining are already available on other exchanges. For examples, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global was recently added to the S&P 500. Circle Internet Group, a stablecoin market leader, recently applied to establish a national trust bank in anticipation of meeting requirements under recent stablecoin legislation to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system. Today, there is a lot of movement in traditional equity markets to incorporate digital asset financial products. This is happening just as a new national stock exchange, TXSE, is seeking to provide an alternative to traditional platforms. Thus, TXSE has the greatest opportunity to truly integrate both digital asset and traditional markets since it starts with a cleaner slate than the older established stock exchanges. Texas wasn‚Äôt the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but its version did go a little further than similar legislation. The first such law was incorporated in New Hampshire, but did not that state‚Äôs reserve to be funded by public dollars. However, on June 20, 2025, Senate Bill 21, created the state-managed Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This legislation outlines the intent to use the digital asset reserve as a financial buffer, hedging against inflation and economic volatility. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by airdrops, legislative appropriations, revenue dedicated by general law, cryptocurrencies acquired through forks, and investment earnings or rewards. This is a significant difference, since Texas has decided to put its own money at risk as a sign to digital asset companies that it is willing to take the same risks on this new asset and industry. At the federal level, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also indicated a willingness to potentially ‚Äúacquire more Bitcoin" to increase the United States‚Äô Bitcoin reserve. Texas is one of the largest economies in the world, and it has already committed to invest in Bitcoin as a method of protecting the finances for its citizens. That is unique among other government institutions - at least for now. When I first moved from Washington, D.C. to Texas, I was a bit concerned that my east coast personality might not mesh well with the local culture. However, the cliche‚Äô of southern hospitality has proven true, both personally and professionally. I‚Äôve watched the same welcoming attitude apply to many businesses that have decided to also make Texas their adopted homes. This has included many digital asset and blockchain based companies during a time when it was not as mainstream to be operating those types of ventures. In the best adopted Texan spirit I can muster - Y‚Äôall should come and check out Texas.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Full Content:
Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard's Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will "redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives." Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as "a blueprint for a hope-filled future," while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could "ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most." Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering‚Äîthe parent company of Gucci‚Äîhas created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, "Heroic Accounting," we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting's core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)‚Äîan organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water‚Äîa resource of growing global concern‚Äîfor each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an "extremely high" risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden‚Äîrated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk‚Äîis estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m¬≥) and South Sudan ($0.53/m¬≥), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI's methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world's poorest, while rich countries‚Äîeven those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada‚Äîare assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being‚Äîthe monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression‚Äîprice. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo ≈†laus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues "We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits." But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager's employees require proficiency in mathematics‚Äîand thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI's approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm's measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country's robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania's low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI's method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. "Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous," write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. "Institutions that lack inclusivity‚Äîwhere political and economic power are concentrated‚Äîtend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment." Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, "Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, 'It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.'" Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian's wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work‚Äîbut how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)‚Äîa method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system‚Äîthe International Comparison Program‚Äîcaution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects‚Äîthose that transcend national boundaries‚Äîsuch as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders‚Äîespecially between rich and poor nations‚Äîrisks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don't need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as BlackRock‚Äôs CEO Takes Helm at World Economic Forum

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, turned one of the world‚Äôs leading financial institutions into a crypto powerhouse. What Michael Saylor and (Micro)Strategy did for Bitcoin treasuries, Fink did for ETFs: And now that Fink has been appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) ‚Äì serving alongside Roche‚Äôs Andr√© Hoffmann ‚Äì what‚Äôs next? Will the WEF take a more explicitly pro-crypto stance? And if so, which are the cryptos best-positioned for explosive growth? Fink‚Äôs appointment arrives just as WEF closed an internal investigation that found no material wrongdoing by founder Klaus Schwab. The WEF framed the move as part of a reset to ‚Äòstrengthen the organization.‚Äô For their part, Fink and Hoffmann emphasized revitalizing public-private cooperation in a ‚Äòfragmented‚Äô world. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. ‚ÄîFink and Hoffman, Statement from Interim Co-Chairs of WEF For crypto, the headline isn‚Äôt just who chairs WEF ‚Äì it‚Äôs that the leading gatekeeper of institutional crypto exposure now has a formal hand on one of the world‚Äôs most influential finance convening platforms. Because BlackRock dominates spot crypto ETFs with iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ($ETHA), it controls real, regulated pipes through which pensions, RIAs, corporates and sovereigns can touch $BTC and $ETH at size. Just last week, Ether ETFs saw record single-day inflows (topping $1.02B), with BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA capturing $640M in one session. Earlier this summer, IBIT‚Äôs held coins crossed 700K BTC, further illustrating its market heft. Its $BUIDL fund ‚Äì tokenized U.S. dollar liquidity issued on Ethereum ‚Äì launched in March 2024, surpassed $1B AUM by March 2025, and later expanded share classes across multiple chains. $BUIDL forms a practical bridge between on-chain finance and institutional balance sheets. Crucially, WEF already runs programs that touch digital assets, like the Digital Currency Governance Consortium (DCGC), and the Crypto Sustainability Coalition. The programs launched between 2021-2022, but have fallen quiet in recent days. What‚Äôs the likely outcome? Probably not a single policy edict ‚Äì Fink spoke in only general terms in his statement ‚Äì but a faster convergence around best practices for custody, market data, disclosures, and interoperability. Those are all areas where BlackRock possesses both operating experience and great success, and which can translate into global templates. And with Fink at the helm of the WEF, look for these three projects to quickly become some of the best crypto to buy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a faster-than-ever Bitcoin experience. How? By combining Bitcoin‚Äôs original Layer 1 with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The result is a lightning-fast Layer 2 that leverages the SVM‚Äôs transaction speeds and smart contract execution ‚Äì but keeps final transaction settlement on Bitcoin. When it comes to Bitcoin itself, $BTC tokens are deposited into the Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and emerge on the Hyper Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. There, your $BTC can be staked, deployed in liquidity pools, used in DeFi operations, and more as the case may be. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide, and don‚Äôt miss out on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction; we think $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of the year, up 2,415% from its current $0.012745. The presale is already well over $10.3M raised. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. Web3 wallets are rapidly becoming far more than simply places to store your crypto; they‚Äôre the gateways to a whole new world of DeFi and crypto tools. And non-custodial wallets ‚Äì where you control your own private keys ‚Äì are critical, as a new wave of crypto users learns the truth of one of crypto‚Äôs founding principles: Best Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with some truly innovative features. In addition to swapping, sending, and storing your crypto, Best Wallet users can access and purchase promising top presales. Find whitepapers and tokenomics, browse new meme coins, and purchase tokens ‚Äì all from within Best Wallet. And the $BEST token is key of this growing Best Wallet economy. Hold $BEST and gain lower trading fees and better staking rewards within Best Wallet. During the presale, you can stake $BEST for an additional 90% APY ‚Äî learn how to buy $BEST here. What is $BEST, if not the best utility token for the Best Wallet? Our price prediction is also bullish, seeing a chance for the token to reach $0.072 by the end of 2025, up 182% from its current level of $0.025495. Check out the Best Wallet Token presale now. The crypto ecosystem is, as Fink pointed out, fragmented. Chainlink ($LINK) helps bind it together. Blockchain oracles feed real-world-data into the blockchain, allowing smart contracts to execute correctly based on price points, timestamps, and more. But Chainlink has grown beyond a simple oracle network. It‚Äôs a web that binds blockchains and TradFi together. It also secures data, offers cross-chain interoperability and decentralized computations to enable finance to operate on-chain, and blockchains to access financial networks. Chainlink notable partners include: On the token side, $LINK is the network‚Äôs utility token. Revenue from on-chain and off-chain operations has provided a hefty reserve: $LINK‚Äôs performance has been impressive as well, up 143% in the past year. Implementing fundamental changes to the world economic order requires far more than simply an interim head of the WEF. Real change will still flow through the SEC, ESMA, FCA, MAS, and countless other agencies. But Fink‚Äôs appointment, combined with IBIT/ETHA‚Äôs scale, record ETF flows, and BlackRock‚Äôs tokenization push, could make him nudge the global conversation toward treating crypto as core market infrastructure, instead of a side bet. If that happens, look for $LINK (oracle networks), $BEST (non-custodial wallet token), and $HYPER (cutting-edge Bitcoin Layer 2) to be among the next crypto to explode.

Title: Tokenized assets near $300 billion as Wall Street quietly floods on chain

Stablecoins dominate at $267 billion while tokenized Treasuries climb past $7 billion. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized assets recorded on public blockchains have reached approximately $293 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. The figure, which includes stablecoins valued at about $266.7 billion, places tokenization near the $300 billion threshold, emphasizing its role as a structural layer in on-chain financial markets. Excluding stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets account for around $26.3 billion. The growth of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has emerged as a defining feature of this market. The segment surpassed $5 billion in March and now measures close to $7.3 billion in outstanding value. BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund represents the largest share, with roughly $2.4 billion, followed by Franklin Templeton‚Äôs BENJI, at about $700 million, while Ondo‚Äôs OUSG and other vehicles, including USYC, JTRSY, and USTB, round out the leading issuers. This movement of short-term debt on the chain has accelerated in a high-interest-rate environment, drawing capital toward tokenized money-market funds and Treasury products. Tokenized Treasury and money-market mutual fund assets rose nearly 80% year to date, reaching $7.4 billion by mid-summer. Market participants increasingly use these products for yield capture and settlement efficiency, with institutional issuers anchoring adoption. Integrating BlackRock and Franklin into on-chain infrastructure illustrates how traditional finance firms use tokenization for capital markets operations beyond pilot programs. These tokenized funds function as yield-bearing stablecoin alternatives, attracting capital that may otherwise remain in non-interest-bearing stablecoin formats. Stablecoins continue to dominate the landscape with nearly $267 billion in value and more than 189 million holders globally, according to RWA.xyz. The sector remains the entry point to tokenized finance while indirectly supporting the Treasury market through reserve allocations. The scale of stablecoin holdings has created a structural bid in short-term U.S. government securities, reinforcing their connection to traditional financial markets. This demand channel links on-chain activity to systemic funding markets and elevates the policy considerations surrounding stablecoin regulation. The diversification of tokenized assets beyond stablecoins highlights further adoption. Data shows smaller but steady issuance across private credit, institutional funds, commodities, and corporate debt instruments. While Ethereum holds more than half of the non-stablecoin RWA share, networks such as ZKsync, Solana, Stellar, and Aptos are capturing portions of issuance, reflecting the infrastructure spread. These developments suggest tokenization is functioning as both a settlement infrastructure and a means of structuring regulated financial products on public ledgers. Institutional entry has been accompanied by exploration from banks and custodians, with settlement portability and collateral efficiency identified as primary drivers. While not all initiatives occur on public blockchains, the continued development of tokenized rails illustrates how traditional finance and crypto-native products are converging around the same operational mechanisms. The distinction between stablecoins as transactional units and tokenized funds as yield-generating products will remain central to how investors allocate across these categories. Tokenized assets approaching $300 billion marks a transition from concept to operating infrastructure. The scale now reflects not only retail payments through stablecoins but also institutionally managed capital in regulated securities, suggesting that tokenization is already a live component of global financial plumbing rather than a speculative frontier.

What happens if Strategy is forced to sell? BlackRock‚Äôs growing influence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and a stake in Strategy raises fears of market manipulation. What was once ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs money‚Äù risks becoming another Wall Street asset. BlackRock‚Äôs growing influence in the crypto sector has sparked intense speculation, with reports suggesting the firm may be orchestrating one of the largest market shake-ups yet. After acquiring a 5% stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially to influence Michael Saylor‚Äôs massive Bitcoin [BTC] holdings, BlackRock has propelled both Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs to fresh highs. Ethereum took center stage on Wall Street as spot ETH ETFs logged a record $1.019 billion net inflow on the 11th of August, with BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) surpassing $10 billion. Meanwhile, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also clocked a milestone, crossing $91.06 billion in assets under management amid Bitcoin‚Äôs surge to a new all-time high of $124,500. This shows that BlackRock is no longer just holding Bitcoin; it‚Äôs moving to control it. It may look minor, but this move effectively connects the two largest Bitcoin whales, BlackRock and Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy. For those unaware, Strategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy depends on debt and stock issuance, making it vulnerable if its stock price drops, and BlackRock knows this. By pressuring MSTR shares, it could push Saylor into liquidating reserves, crashing BTC‚Äôs price, only to buy it back cheaply and tighten its grip on the market. This isn‚Äôt speculation without evidence. Additionally, in June, Strategy moved 7,382 BTC (around $850 million) to Coinbase Prime, not typical behavior for long-term holders, but a clear sign of preparation for potential liquidation. Around the same time, BlackRock sold over $500 million worth of Bitcoin in just 48 hours. For a firm of their size, that‚Äôs pocket change, but symbolically, it points toward a broader reset strategy. If BlackRock triggers this cascade, the fallout could be brutal and Bitcoin could plunge to $65K‚Äì$60K, Ethereum to $1.7K, while altcoins face losses of 80‚Äì90%. Derivatives markets would also implode, exchanges might freeze, and retail investors would capitulate at the worst possible moment. Meanwhile, institutions would be quietly accumulating the very assets retail abandoned in fear. The most dangerous part would be that BlackRock‚Äôs ETF, IBIT, already controls flows of hundreds of thousands of BTC. By adding influence over Strategy, they would dominate both direct Bitcoin supply and corporate reserves. What looks like a market strategy is actually a bid for a monopoly. If one entity can corner 70% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply, decentralization, the very foundation of crypto, collapses. For BlackRock, it‚Äôs not about short-term profits. It‚Äôs about accumulation, dominance, and rewriting the rules of the Bitcoin market. If such a strategy unfolds, it could mark a turning point for Bitcoin‚Äôs identity. What began as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance may risk being reshaped into yet another Wall Street instrument, traded, leveraged, and collateralized like gold or oil. The recent slip in Strategy‚Äôs stock price to $366.32, down 1.78% in the past 24 hours, underscores the fragility of this balance. Therefore, as institutional giants tighten their grip, the crypto community faces a pressing question. Will Bitcoin remain ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs money,‚Äù or evolve into a tool of centralized financial power?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appointed as WEF interim co-chair

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, alongside Roche‚Äôs Andr√© Hoffmann. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The World Economic Forum (WEF), the influential global convening force for policymakers and industry leaders, has appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as interim co-chair. The move comes hot on the heels of a high-profile internal review that cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing and set the stage for a temporary leadership overhaul as the organization recalibrates its governance model. With trillions in assets under management, BlackRock commands outsized influence across financial markets, ESG policy, and the investment strategies of governments and corporations. Fink‚Äôs interim appointment is a strategic move that could accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin within global policy forums and mainstream financial infrastructure. Fink‚Äôs appointment comes at a time when questions around institutional trust, sustainability, and cross-border cooperation are more acute than ever. Under Fink‚Äôs guidance, BlackRock has been a pioneer of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, pushing for a more climate-resilient global economy; a priority that has increasingly permeated WEF dialogues in Davos and beyond. BlackRock has also been a major institutional force in crypto markets, and its landmark Bitcoin spot ETF approval in early 2024 dramatically accelerated adoption and legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class for pensions, endowments, and retail investors globally. With Fink at the helm of the WEF, the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset economy blur even further. The Forum regularly shapes global regulatory, economic, and technology discussions, and Fink now holds considerable influence over both Wall Street and Davos. Fink‚Äôs appointment could usher in a more progressive stance on crypto within elite policy circles, potentially opening doors for greater integration of Bitcoin and blockchain solutions in global finance and among world decision-makers. The internal review that prompted these shifts centered on longstanding questions about Klaus Schwab‚Äôs role and the organizational structure of the Forum. Schwab, who founded the WEF in 1971, has long been a focal point for criticism and, lately, scrutiny regarding governance. After clearing Schwab of wrongdoing, the WEF announced its intention to install interim co-chairs in a bid to increase transparency and bring new perspectives to the leadership table. Fink‚Äôs appointment thereby serves a dual purpose: to reassure stakeholders by placing a respected industry leader in stewardship, and to reinforce the Forum‚Äôs commitment to institutional accountability and renewal. Fink will serve alongside other interim co-chair, Andr√© Hoffmann, vice chairman of Roche Holding AG, forming a joint leadership that reflects the WEF‚Äôs renewed mandate for broad-based, multi-sector collaboration. With geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties, and the accelerating pace of climate change occupying center stage, the incoming interims face a tall order: restore confidence, drive progress across key global issues, and prepare the Forum for its next chapter.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/17/2025 10:33:47 AM PDT by Roman_War_Criminal In April, at an extraordinary meeting of the World Economic Forum (‚ÄúWEF‚Äù) board, Klaus Schwab announced he was stepping down with immediate effect and bogeyman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was appointed the interim Chairman.

Title: The ‚ÄúLayer 1‚Äù Fight Is Not About Stablecoins But The Future Of Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/08/17/the-layer-1-fight-is-not-about-stablecoins-but-the-future-of-finance/
Time Published: 2025-08-17T16:46:41Z
Full Content:
ByDavid G.W. Birch ByDavid G.W. Birch, Contributor. With the GENIUS Act signed, stablecoins are on a tear. According to the management consultancy McKinsey, the total value of issued stablecoins has doubled to $250 billion today from $120 billion 18 months ago, and it is forecast to reach more than $400 billion by year-end (and $2 trillion by 2028). Wow. In addition to stablecoins tokens, a number of yield-bearing tokens are out there now. These tokens, typically an investment in short-duration government securities, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($2.9 billion) and the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund ($0.8 billion). Big money, and hence the reasons for the ‚ÄúLayer 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù discussions in decentralised finance (DeFi) circles. I am sure you are all familiar with the distinction, but for those who are new to this space, when DeFi people talk about Layer 1 they mean a distributed ledger of some kind (such as the Bitcoin blockchain) whereas Layer 2 networks run on top of the Layer 1 blockchains in order to delivered improved performance or additional functionality. The Layer 2 networks execute transactions off of the ledgers but use Layer 1 to provide the underlying security and finality. So, for example: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 protocol, but on top of this people have built Lightning, which is a Layer 2 service that uses off-chain ‚Äúpayment channels‚Äù to make Bitcoin transactions work at point-of-sale (POS). Similarly, Ethereum is a Layer 1 blockhain and Arbitrum is a Layer 2 service that uses a ‚Äúrollup‚Äù mechanism to anchor transactions. Well, so far, so technical. But there is escalating competition in this space and that has business implications. The news that major players, such as Circle and Stripe, are developing their own Layer 1 networks is rather interesting. Given their investments in the stablecoin space it seems logical for Stripe, for example, to create a new high performance Layer 1 blockchain specially designed to for payment processing. Their blockchain, known as ‚ÄúTempo‚Äù, is compatible with Ethereum‚Äôs programming language so developers will be able to easily migrate ‚Äúsmart" ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù to the new blockchain. Similarly, Circle announced its new Layer-1 blockchain ‚ÄúArc‚Äù (also compatible with the Ethereum programming language) which they say is optimised for stablecoin-based financial services. Arc has native support for the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and stablecoins including USDC, EURC and USYC1. It also has, rather interestingly from my point of view, an opt-in privacy schemes that offers selectively shielded transactions. Circle say that Arc is designed not only for stablecoins but for all forms of digital money and tokenized value in the future, a point I will return to later on. Now you might ask, since Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to work, why are serious players in the stablecoin space looking to build their own Layer 1 blockchains while others are already building Layer 2 rails (such as Robinhood‚Äôs chain on Arbitrum and Coinbase‚Äôs Base on the OP Stack) that also seem to work. There are, broadly speaking there are two business pressures: functionality and economics. Functionality first. A good reason to develop a Layer 1 is to ensure the development of features that are required by the ecosystem. Now that this infrastructure is no longer a technical detail but a defining factor in who leads the next phase of digital finance, business is paying attention and as stablecoins begin to be used in mainstream business applications, so operational pressures will increase and favour platforms that are secure, compliant and capable of high-throughput transactions. As the respected industry commentator Noelle Acheson noted in the case of both Circle and Stripe, these will be the priorities of most financial services players but they are not necessarily the priorities of blockchains such as the Bitcoin blockchain, which was optimised for censorship resistance. There is also the element of control: decentralisation sounds good but it would be annoying to find that your payroll payments to employees are held up because everyone is playing some sort of cryptokitties game or messing around with NFTs. Then there are the economics. The fact is that running decentralised network is expensive. If you want the censorship resistance of Bitcoin then you have to consume enormous amounts of energy and therefore charge significant fees. This is a key reason people started building Layer 2 networks in the first place. But if you don‚Äôt need the pseudonymity and censorship resistance (ie, you are running a regulated financial service) then you can redesign the infrastructure in a far more cost-effective way. You can imagine, then, that if Stripe offers stablecoin services to its global customer base, it will offer them its own stablecoins running over its own network and the transactions will never go anywhere near the world‚Äôs banking networks except for on- and off-ramps. Assuming, that is, that Stripe‚Äôs customers won‚Äôt want to hold stablecoin balances that are non-interest bearing. (Of course once the service is up and running then Stripe can offer their infrastructure to third-parties so that they can use the Stripe Layer 1 to provide stablecoin services to their own customers. Given that payments are such a huge, but vulnerable, profit pool for the TradFi incumbents they they will have to respond.) Where does this take us then? I suspect that the average consumer (eg, me) will have zero interest in Layer 1 or Layer 2 of indeed how any payments get anywhere. If I tell my accounting package to go ahead and pay a supplier in Canada, I really do not care how the money gets there: if Stripe uses open banking to take the money out of my UK account, take Canadian Dollar stablecoins from their Treasury and then send these stablecoins over to Canada where they are then paid out to the supplier using Interac e-Transfer, or whether they send the money from my bank account via SWIFT to a Canadian bank account, I do not care. Hence the winners and losers here will be determined by their cost-benefit performance for business. The battle for Layer 1, though, is not only about the battle to control payments, because it is about much more than stablecoins. As Circle indicated, it is about the future of value, a future in which the continuous exchange of ‚Äúreal world‚Äù digital assets replaces the traditional infrastructure (and associated overheads) of clearing and settlement vanish. In this world, the next-general financial market infrastructure of distributed ledgers, tokens and protocols (that is, ‚Äúdefi‚Äù) that will in essence become critical national infrastructure. Can this really be provided Circle or Stripe? Or will it ultimately need Big Tech or governments or someone else to deliver the platform for innovation?

The experts also spotted exploitable weaknesses in its infrastructure that defenders can exploit to disrupt campaigns. ‚ÄúIts earliest versions were built using the leaked Cerberus source code, and by late 2023, version 2.0 had incorporated large portions of the Hook botnet‚Äôs codebase. The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications.‚Äù reads the report published by Hunt.io. Researchers from ThreatFabric first discovered ERMAC in July 2021, the initial version was almost fully based on the popular banking trojan Cerberus. The source code of Cerberus was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction. According to the experts, ERMAC is operated by DukeEugene, the threat actor behind the BlackRock mobile malware. The leak of the ERMAC 3.0 code exposed flaws like hardcoded secrets, static tokens, and weak credentials. Version 3.0 supports new injection methods, a C2 panel, Android backdoor, and AES-CBC comms, confirming ERMAC as an active MaaS platform. ‚ÄúERMAC primarily leverages form injects for capturing sensitive data, which is done by serving custom form injects through the public/injects directory.‚Äù continues the post. ‚ÄúERMAC targets primarily financial applications with a large focus on mobile banking and cryptocurrency applications with it, capturing sensitive data such as login credentials or credit card data.‚Äù Hunt.io discovered the full ERMAC V3.0 source code on an open directory on 141[.]164[.]62[.]236. The leak includes backend (PHP/Laravel C2), frontend (React), Golang exfiltration server, Docker configs, and builder. Analysis showed extensive operator control via form injects targeting 700+ apps, mainly banking and crypto, exfiltrating credentials via Android callbacks. Researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, including a hardcoded JWT, default root credentials, and open registration. Panels and exfil servers remain active, confirming ERMAC as an evolving MaaS platform. ERMAC 3.0 relies on the Kotlin backdoor that supports 71 languages and encrypts traffic with AES-CBC. The malware does not target systems in CIS regions and avoid running in emulators. The malicious code requests elevated permissions for its execution, it can exfiltrate device data, and execute extensive commands, from stealing SMS and contacts to pushing fake overlays, call forwarding, Gmail theft, file access, and even taking photos. A web-based builder lets operators customize campaigns. Hunt.io mapped its live C2 panels, APIs, and exfil servers via HuntSQL queries, aiding defenders in tracking and disrupting ERMAC‚Äôs infrastructure. ‚ÄúERMAC targets users of banking, shopping, and other financial applications primarily through web injects. It relies on Android‚Äôs WebView API to place an overlay on top of legitimate apps, capturing credentials and payment information. Implementing secure Android permissions such as FLAG_SECURE and using code to detect or block overlays can reduce exposure to this technique.‚Äù concludes the report. ‚ÄúDefenders can also focus on identifying and disrupting ERMAC infrastructure. Regularly scan for active C2 and exfiltration servers, and block Android applications that reference known ERMAC IPs or domains.‚Äù Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini (SecurityAffairs ‚Äì hacking, ERMAC 3.0) Cyber Crime / August 20, 2025 Security / August 20, 2025 Data Breach / August 20, 2025 Cyber Crime / August 20, 2025 Security / August 20, 2025 To contact me write an email to: Pierluigi Paganini : [email protected] Copyright@securityaffairs 2024

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 12:03:12 PM PDT by DFG The World Economic Forum closed an investigation on its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday, clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's (ROG.S), opens new tab vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. -- snip -- In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honored to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from lives of ordinary people.

Title: Plastics Manufacturing At Crossroads: Pivot To Lead Or Lose
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/trondarneundheim/2025/08/16/plastics-manufacturing-at-crossroads-pivot-to-lead-or-lose/

ByTrond Arne Undheim ByTrond Arne Undheim, Contributor. The latest UN plastics treaty collapse underscored what markets already know: a $400 billion stranded asset risk that forward-thinking petrochemical leaders must now confront strategically. While legacy producers viewed blocking production caps as protecting industry interests, market forces don‚Äôt wait for diplomatic consensus. The transition window for plastics producers and pushers alike is narrowing, and who controls that transformation will determine market winners for the next three decades. The plastics industry faces mounting exposure across financial, regulatory, and reputational dimensions. The data reveals systemic vulnerabilities: only 9% of plastic waste is successfully recycled globally, microplastics now contaminate human blood as confirmed by groundbreaking research, and current projections show plastic production almost tripling by 2060. Meanwhile, oil majors increasingly depend on petrochemicals as their primary growth hedge against transport electrification. This isn't environmental ideology‚Äîit's risk management. Carbon Tracker has identified $400 billion in planned petrochemical expansions built on assumptions of infinite demand growth, while regulatory reality tells a different story. The EU's PPWR mandates 30% recycled content by 2030, California's SB 54 bans non-recyclable packaging, and consumer sentiment has shifted decisively toward sustainability metrics in purchasing decisions. The strategic question isn‚Äôt whether to change course, but how to optimize portfolio transition while preserving long-term revenue streams. Legacy models that expose firms to mounting financial, reputational, and regulatory risk need managed evolution, not overnight abandonment. Global investors are increasingly differentiating between high-risk commodity plastics and resilient specialty applications. BlackRock and LGIM now vote against directors of firms failing to address plastic-related risks. Project financing for petrochemical expansions faces enhanced ESG scrutiny, as demonstrated by investor concerns around major Gulf Coast projects. Lloyd's of London's exclusion of microplastic liability coverage signals broader insurance market caution. Firms that move first in rebalancing portfolios toward higher-value, lower-risk applications will secure cheaper access to capital. The market is rewarding strategic repositioning while penalizing commodity exposure‚Äîa trend that will only accelerate as ESG integration deepens across global finance. Strategic manufacturers are already rebalancing based on regulatory exposure and long-term demand fundamentals. Rather than wholesale abandonment, smart money is shifting toward value-preservation strategies that target virgin plastic cuts of 20% by 2027 under emerging regulations: High-value durables: Automotive, aerospace, medical, and renewable energy infrastructure applications offer better regulatory protection and margin stability than commodity packaging. PVC and polystyrene exposure: These face accelerating regulatory pressure. IKEA's aggressive phaseout‚Äîplastic packaging eliminated for new ranges in 2025, complete elimination by 2028‚Äîsignals corporate buyer behavior. Strategic exit while assets retain value makes financial sense. Multi-layer films: Major brands are abandoning these recycling-incompatible formats. PepsiCo's 2025 backtrack reveals the credibility gap‚Äîslashing virgin plastic cut targets from 20% to 2% while claiming 97% recyclable packaging by 2030. Compare to Unilever's ‚Ç¨1 billion investment in reusable packaging systems, already showing 12% cost savings in pilot markets, proving circular models can be profit centers rather than compliance costs. Engineering plastics: Specialty applications provide longer runway and higher barriers to substitution, making them natural portfolio anchors during transition. Petrochemical majors possess unique advantages in commercializing next-generation technologies. While startups develop promising innovations, established players have the balance sheets and engineering capacity to scale them globally. The technology landscape offers adjacency opportunities rather than existential threats: Carbon utilization: CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals technologies transform waste streams into feedstock, leveraging existing infrastructure while improving carbon footprints. LanzaTech's UK expansion in 2025 demonstrates how major players can scale these faster than venture-backed newcomers. Advanced recycling: Chemical recycling and enzyme-based depolymerization require the kind of industrial-scale deployment that suits petrochemical engineering capabilities. Carbios' enzyme facility became operational despite 2025 restructuring, while Loop Industries launched Twist resin with a 70,000-ton facility planned. Microbial manufacturing: Cemvita Factory's breakthrough in using engineered microbes to produce industrial chemicals from CO‚ÇÇ and waste streams could reach commercial scale within the decade, offering petrochemical companies new bio-based production pathways. Feedstock diversification: Bio-based and captured-carbon feedstocks expand the resource base rather than threatening it, creating opportunities for companies with processing expertise and global distribution networks. UBQ Materials' 2025 masterbatch launch exemplifies how waste streams become valuable inputs. The question isn't whether these technologies will scale‚Äîit's who will control their commercialization. First-mover advantages in licensing, partnership, and deployment could define the next industrial cycle. Global policy fragmentation creates near-term arbitrage opportunities while markets converge toward sustainability standards. Petrochemical leaders are uniquely positioned to exploit these asymmetries while building transition capabilities: Europe's strict EPR rules reward recycled content expertise. California's packaging restrictions favor mono-material innovation. Emerging markets maintain growth potential for essential applications while developed markets focus on circularity. BP's own Energy Outlook acknowledges that declining oil use in road transport is being offset by increasing petrochemical demand, but smart players are preparing for the eventual policy convergence. This fragmentation won't last indefinitely, but it provides a transition window for companies that invest now in capabilities they'll need globally later. Building circular expertise in sympathetic markets creates competitive advantages when regulations harmonize. Companies that invest now in next-generation sorting systems like TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI for aluminum recovery will be positioned to capture value as feedstock quality requirements increase globally. BP's 2025 Energy Outlook confirms oil demand peaked in 2025 at 102 million barrels per day, with petrochemical demand offsetting transport decline but plateauing by decade's end. As global awareness of environmental justice rises, companies that proactively address community siting, health impacts, and international waste flows will preserve operating licenses and avoid costly litigation. The traditional export of difficult-to-recycle materials to developing nations creates mounting reputational and legal exposure. Forward-thinking companies are investing in domestic circular systems while partnering with international communities rather than simply relocating problems. This isn't just ethical positioning‚Äîit's risk mitigation against consumer boycotts, investor flight, and regulatory backlash as environmental justice movements gain political influence. ESG reporting has become performance theater designed to deflect rather than direct real change. The metrics that matter for survival cut through the noise: annual virgin plastic reduction percentages, microplastic leakage per product unit, and community impact assessments that resist superficial disclosure games. Companies serious about transformation are adopting cradle-to-cradle design principles, where materials flow in closed loops rather than linear waste streams. They're licensing breakthrough technologies rather than developing incrementally. They're building durable license-to-operate through genuine community partnerships. Most importantly, they're setting concrete targets: 20% virgin plastic reduction by 2027, zero microplastic leakage by 2030, and measurable community health improvements in production zones. The industry faces three plausible scenarios by 2030, each offering different positioning opportunities: Regulatory Acceleration: Rapid policy convergence around EPR and production limits favors companies with advanced circular capabilities and low-risk portfolio composition. Managed Transition: Gradual policy evolution allows time for technology deployment and market development, rewarding strategic partnerships between petrochemical leaders and innovation companies. Technology Breakthrough: CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals, advanced recycling, or bio-feedstock innovations achieve cost parity faster than expected, creating opportunities for early deployment partnerships. In each scenario, petrochemical majors who position themselves as energy-to-materials champions of the 21st century rather than defensive incumbents will capture the largest share of transition value. The companies that lead circular innovation rather than simply comply with it will define the next industrial era. The winning strategy combines managed portfolio evolution with aggressive technology deployment. Rather than abandoning core capabilities, leaders will redeploy them toward sustainable feedstocks, circular business models, and high-value applications that align with rather than fight against regulatory trends. Critically, circular feedstocks expand rather than shrink petrochemical demand pools‚Äîthey simply change the input sources while leveraging existing processing expertise. By 2030, expect three pivotal shifts that will reshape competitive dynamics: ‚Ä¢ Policy Convergence: The EU will implement a plastics border adjustment mechanism by the early 2030s, forcing global convergence on recycled content standards and inspiring similar measures in North America and Asia. ‚Ä¢ Petrostate Reinvention: At least one Gulf petrostate‚Äîlikely Saudi Arabia or the UAE‚Äîwill reposition as a global circular hub, investing heavily in CO‚ÇÇ-to-chemicals and advanced recycling to preserve export relevance in a carbon-constrained world. ‚Ä¢ Innovation Breakthroughs: TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI systems, Carbios' operational enzyme facility, LanzaTech's UK scale-up, and Cemvita's microbial manufacturing platform will achieve commercial scale within five years, redrawing competitive advantage across the value chain. Additionally, Loop Industries' Twist resin launch and UBQ Materials' masterbatch deployment signal industrial breakthrough timing. The transformation won't be driven by treaties alone‚Äîcapital markets, regulators, and technology innovators are reshaping the rules of industrial survival faster than diplomatic processes ever could. Expect at least one $10 billion petrochemical expansion to be mothballed or canceled under investor pressure before 2030, validating Carbon Tracker's stranded asset thesis. This isn't about corporate virtue signaling‚Äîit's about optimizing portfolios for long-term value creation under changing market conditions. The petrochemical industry's inflection point has arrived. Companies can defend obsolete positions, adapt portfolios reactively, or lead the transition and capture first-mover advantages in next-generation materials. The UN's failure created a transition window, not a reprieve. Carbon Tracker research shows the industry is betting its future on demand growth that regulatory and market forces will constrain. The smartest leaders aren't waiting for policy clarity‚Äîthey're building capabilities that will thrive under any plausible regulatory scenario. The choice is strategic: adapt portfolios now to secure relevance through 2050 and beyond, or risk portfolio stranding as markets evolve. The companies that redeploy petrochemical expertise toward circular systems, sustainable feedstocks, and high-value applications won't just survive the transition‚Äîthey'll define it. The question is not whether this pivot happens, but which companies seize it first‚Äîand which are left behind. The next industrial cycle will be built on resource optimization, not resource depletion. The question is not whether the plastics pivot happens, but which manufacturing companies seize it first‚Äîand which are left behind.

Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championships: Leinster 22 Munster 33 Munster put themselves in pole position for a shot at regaining the Vodafone Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championship title following a business-like 33-22 win over Leinster at Energia Park. Playing with a maturity beyond her years, 19-year-old outhalf Caitr√≠ona Finn turned in her second player-of-the-match performance in the space of a week as Munster handed the defending champions a rare home defeat. Chisom Ugwueru‚Äôs try just before half-time, adding to a quick-fire Chloe Pearse brace either side of the 20-minute mark, had Munster leading 19-10 as they proved clinical with ball in hand. Leinster debutant Vicky Elmes Kinlan‚Äôs dazzling opener had certainly raised the decibel level. Yellow cards for forwards Lisa Callan and Jane Neill hampered them, albeit that Kathy Baker was able to cross in the 28th minute. However, Matt Brown‚Äôs charges effectively sealed the result when Kate Flannery and Aoife Corey both touched down inside 12 minutes of the restart. Molly Boyne and Katie Whelan replied late on for Leinster, giving them their own bonus point. With back-to-back bonus point victories, and next Saturday‚Äôs trip to Ulster still to come, Munster look red-hot favourites for the final in Donnybrook in two weeks‚Äô time. To set up a rematch with their arch rivals, Leinster will need to beat Connacht in Galway next week. Scorers: Leinster: Tries: Vicky Elmes Kinlan, Kathy Baker, Molly Boyne, Katie Whelan; Con: Ellie O‚ÄôSullivan Sexton Munster: Tries: Chloe Pearse 2, Chisom Ugwueru, Kate Flannery, Aoife Corey; Cons: Caitr√≠ona Finn 4 LEINSTER: Ellie O‚ÄôSullivan Sexton (Old Belvedere RFC); Emma Brogan (MU Barnhall RFC), Kathy Baker (Blackrock College RFC), Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC), Maggie Boylan (Blackrock College RFC); Nikki Caughey (Railway Union RFC), Jade Gaffney (Old Belvedere RFC); Aoife Moore (Blackrock College RFC), Lisa Callan (Old Belvedere RFC), Katie Layde (Old Belvedere RFC), Cl√≠odhna N√≠ Chonchobhair (Blackrock College RFC), Kate Jordan (Blackrock College RFC), Ciara Short (Wicklow RFC), Molly Boyne (Railway Union RFC) (capt), Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC).

Referee: Siobh√°n Daly (IRFU) Connacht 12 Ulster 7 Second-half tries from replacement Faith Oviawe and Roisin Maher steered a young Connacht team to a gutsy 12-7 win over Ulster at Dexcom Stadium. With 21-year-old captain and player-of-the-match √âabha Nic Dhonnacha leading by example, Emer O‚ÄôDowd‚Äôs charges recovered from an early deficit to open their win account in this year‚Äôs Vodafone Women‚Äôs Interprovincial Championship. Ulster‚Äôs new centre Siobh√°n Sheerin thundered over in the ninth minute, raising her side‚Äôs hopes of a first victory at this level in two years. They still led 7-0 after half-time, emerging unscathed from Brenda Barr‚Äôs sinbinning. Nonetheless, with Connacht‚Äôs bench having the desired impact, forwards Oviawe and Maher scored within seven minutes of each other. In addition, Nic Dhonnacha clipped over the first conversion. The hosts, who wore their club socks on their State of Origin day, remained on the front foot and saw out a rousing triumph, putting last week‚Äôs disappointing display against Munster to bed. Unfortunately the hard-earned four points came at a cost for Connacht as the luckless Kayla Waldron was stretchered off in her first game since a horrific leg break in April 2024. There was a lot of concern too for Emily Foley who was taken off with an injury late on. Ulster picked up a losing bonus point for their efforts, and will have home advantage against table toppers Munster at Affidea Stadium next Saturday. Connacht remain in Galway, with a place in the final to play for against Leinster, who are two points better off. Scorers: Connacht: Tries: Faith Oviawe, Roisin Maher; Con: √âabha Nic Dhonnacha.

Title: Nothing to See Here: World Economic Forum Internal Investigation Clears Founder Klaus Schwab of Wrongdoing

An internal investigation conducted by the World Economic Forum has determined that there was no evidence that founder and former chairman Klaus Schwab committed wrongdoing during his time at the helm of the top globalist institution. Amid stepping down as chairman of the WEF in April, Great Reset architect Klaus Schwab faced accusations from whistleblowers of misconduct, including using World Economic Forum funds to pay for in-room massages in hotels, having staff withdraw WEF money from ATMs for his personal use, and using the organisation‚Äôs global competitivesness report to ‚Äúcurry favour‚Äù with certain governments. The 87-year-old German-born economist denied all allegations and reportedly launched a lawsuit against the whistleblowers. In response, the WEF hired the Swiss law firm Homburger as well as the American Covington & Burling firm to carry out an internal investigation into Schwab. Announcing the findings of the probe on Friday, the organisation said, according to the Financial Times: ‚ÄúMinor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct.‚Äù The WEF board went on to say that it sought to ‚Äúaddress all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general‚Äù. For his part, the former chairman said he was ‚Äúpleased that today‚Äôs decision lays the foundation for the WEF to continue contributing to the positive development of our society in the future, mindful of its more than 50-year history‚Äù. Meanwhile, the WEF named U.S. billionaire BlackRock ceo Larry Fink and Hoffmann-La Roche vice-chairman Andr√© Hoffmann as interim chairmen of the board as it seeks a permanent replacement for Schwab. The pair said that they plan on ‚Äúreinventing and strengthening the forum as an indispensable institution for public-private co-operation‚Äù. Originally founded as the European Management Forum in 1971 by then relatively unknown Geneva professor Schwab, with just $6,000 in startup funds, the World Economic Forum has gone on to become one of the most influential NGOs on the planet, with world leaders and heads of industry flocking every year to its annual conference in the Swiss ski town of Davos. Under Schwab‚Äôs leadership, the WEF became a leading promoter of an array of globalist projects, including carbon taxes, central bank digital currencies, global governance, tech censorship, transhumanism, and veganism, among others. Schwab also famously coined the concept of a ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù of global capitalism in which so-called ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù would shape decision-making about the world‚Äôs economy rather than simple market forces.
