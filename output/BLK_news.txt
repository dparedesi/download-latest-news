More Info The Panama Canal is considering an idea to build a pipeline to ship liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the key trade chokepoint to potentially bring gas from the U.S. to Japan, according to the canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez. “We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger,” Vasquez told Reuters. The canal authorities see moving gas through Panama as a top priority, but it’s also highly complex, according to Vasquez. The canal administrator cited initial studies pointing out that the possible capacity of LPG traffic through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd in a decade. The administration of the Panama Canal expects to decide over the next year whether it would proceed with the plan, Vasquez told Reuters. The idea to move gas through the canal comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. Administration and Panama, after President Donald Trump said America should take back the canal it had helped build. Earlier this month, a consortium led by BlackRock bought two ports on either side of the Panama Canal just a few weeks after President Trump threatened to use force to restore U.S. control over the energy chokepoint. The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing. Along with the Panama ports, CK Hutchinson will also sell its controlling stakes in 43 other ports in 23 countries. President Trump hailed the deal, saying last week in a speech in the U.S Congress that “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.” By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Kazakhstan in Talks With Big Oil to Cut Output Next Post U.S. LNG Developers Seek Higher Delivery Prices as Costs Surge Tsvetana is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing for news outlets such as iNVEZZ and SeeNews.

Title: BlackRock’s Takeover of Panama Canal Is First Major Victory for Trump’s “Americas First” Policy

But what could it mean for China’s trade relations with Latin America, in particular the US’ largest trade partner Mexico? Midway through last week, as the economic reverberations from Trump’s latest round of tariffs spread around the world, the Hong Kong-based (and Cayman Islands-registered) conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings caught global markets off guard. Straight out of the blue, the company announced that it was selling 80% of its subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, including its 90% stake in the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” In a speech to the US Congress on March 4, Donald Trump bragged: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals. CK Hutchison’s decision to sell up its port holdings company in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, gives the BlackRock consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries. They include the Panamanian ports of Balboa and Cristobal, four ports in Mexico, 13 in Europe, 12 in the Middle East and Africa, and 11 in East Asia and the Pacific. Unsurprisingly, Hutchison will retain control of its 10 docks in China, including two in Hong Kong. It is debatable just how good a financial deal this was for the BlackRock-led consortium. As Yves points out in the comments below, participation in the Panama Canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). The decision to sell the canal was driven primarily by geopolitical concerns, as reports the South China Morning Post: CK Hutchison Holdings’ decision to sell its port operations in the Panama Canal and elsewhere is to mitigate against geopolitical risks even though it framed it as a purely commercial move, analysts and sources said, urging Hong Kong’s other major companies to also prepare for unparalleled global uncertainties. From a geopolitical perspective, the deal represents a victory for the Trump administration and a setback for China’s belt-and-road ambitions given that some 6% of global trade passes through the Panama Canal. There could be alternative express trade routes connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans some time in the not-too-distant future, however. Nicaragua, a close ally of China and Russia, has recently revived plans to build its own canal, though it will take years to complete, assuming it ever is. There is also Mexico’s Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), a multibillion-dollar project that connects the port of Salina Cruz, on Oaxaca’s Pacific coast, with Coatzacoalcos, on the Gulf of Mexico with both freight and passenger rail travel (h/t upstater). As we reported in 2023, the project, if well-executed, could hold the key to hedging the global economy’s dependence on the drought-hit Panama Canal. And the good news is that the project is relatively close to completion. Money has been pouring in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. The south-eastern region of Mexico across which the CIIT will eventually criss-cross is one of Mexico’s poorest, but both the AMLO and Sheinbaum governments have prioritised its economic development. The region has also been receiving significant Chinese investments over the past decade while US companies have largely neglected it, preferring to focus on Mexico’s northern border regions, according to a 2023 report by Mexico Business News. Whether that trend continues time will soon tell. Back in Panama, China will presumably continue to have sway over the economy. But there’s no denying that the BlackRock-led consortium’s takeover of the canal’s two main ports signifies a clear shift toward closer realignment of Panama with Washington’s interests. It also represents a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions, as Benjamin Norton notes in his Geopolitical Economy Report: BlackRock is the world’s biggest investment company. It managed a record high of $11.6 trillion in assets in the fourth quarter of 2024. (The top 500 investment managers on Earth together held $128 trillion in assets at the end of 2023.) The Associated Press reported that the BlackRock-led consortium now controls at least 43 ports in 23 countries. The Wall Street giant’s subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners was central to the US government-sponsored Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), which was launched by the Joe Biden administration and the G7. BlackRock’s billionaire CEO Larry Fink was invited to sit with Western heads of state at the G7 summit in Italy in 2024, where he called for “public-private partnerships” to help Wall Street firms buy up global infrastructure, especially in poor, formerly colonized countries. BlackRock has enjoyed a very close relationship with the US government, under both Democrats and Republicans. Fink said before the US presidential election in November 2024 that it “really doesn’t matter” who wins, because both parties would benefit Wall Street. Bloomberg reported that Fink personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The financial media outlet noted that the billionaire CEO bragged of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. Trying to Halt a 25-year Trend As we have documented in numerous posts since the summer of 2021, the US’ apex strategic rival, China, has not only gained a foothold in the US’ backyard in the past three decades but has even begun to win the race for economic supremacy in the region. China is already South America’s largest trade partner, and as we saw with the recent opening of the Chinese-funded and controlled mega-port in Chancay, Peru, its Belt and Road Initiative promises to further cement that position. Besides Hutchinson’s controlling stake of Panama’s two main ports since 2015, the Trump administration’s main bone of contention with the Central American nation was the fact that its government, like most governments in Latin America, had signed the Belt and Road Initiative. In fact, Panama was the first Latin America country to do so, in 2017. Since then, 20 other countries in the region have signed the initiative, including Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Perú, Nicaragua and Argentina. To placate Washington’s demands, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino said he would not renew Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review, becoming the first country in the region to leave Beijing’s global infrastructure initiative. He also mentioned the possibility of his government reconsidering the concession granted to Hutchinson Ports. The move sparked an unusually sharp rebuke from Beijing slamming Washington’s “Cold War mentality” in Latin America. From Al Jazeera: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China on Friday hit out at the United States for sabotaging the global infrastructure programme. Beijing “firmly opposes the United States using pressure and coercion to smear and undermine Belt and Road cooperation,” said Lin Jian in a statement. “The US side’s attacks … once again expose its hegemonic nature.” Referring to a visit this week to the region by Marco Rubio, Lin said the US Secretary of State’s comments “unjustly accuse China, deliberately sow discord between China and relevant Latin American countries, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests”. A Different Vision of Multipolarity With Trump back in power, the US may have finally accepted the multipolar reality of today’s world but, as Conor noted in his recent post, The Empire Rebrands: Foreign Policy Under Trump 2.0, the Washington’s vision of multipolarity differs markedly from the one envisioned by China, Russia and other countries in the so-called “Global South”: As many have pointed out, the US seeks win-lose transactions, and this is nothing new under Trump. As Glenn Diesen states: In a multipolar world, security is enhanced by reducing the security competition between the great powers, while a mutually beneficial peace can exist under a balance of power and acceptance of the status quo. Even small- and medium-sized states can obtain more political autonomy from the great powers by cooperating with all great powers to diversify their economic connectivity. However, the US appears to be attempting to defeat China as its main rival, and coerce small and medium states into spheres of influence to ensure political and economic obedience. This is now playing out in Latin America. It is no coincidence that the US’ new Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first international tour was to the five Central American countries of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. Officially speaking, Rubio was visiting these countries for three main reasons: to stop mass illegal immigration to the US; to fight the “scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers”; and “to counter China, and deepen economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere.” As a trading power, the US continues to holds significant sway over Central America. Pound for pound, it is still Latin America and the Caribbean’s largest trading partner. But that is predominantly due to its huge trade flows with Mexico, which account for a whopping 71% of all US-LatAm trade. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico out of the equation, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trading partner. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Mexico, as with most parts of Central America, is growing fast, or at least was. And it is this trend that the Trump administration wants to halt, or even reverse. In order to achieve that, Trump 2.0 is, according to the Washington Post, “reviving” the two-centuries old Monroe Doctrine: Long-attuned to U.S. slights both perceived and real, few [policy makers in the region] missed Trump’s throwaway line during his signing of executive orders just hours after his inauguration. Relations with Latin America “should be great,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “They need us much more than we need them. We don’t need them.” “What is the point of saying that?” asked the senior South American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid drawing unwanted attention to his country. “It’s destroying trust. … Instead of inviting us to a new vision, he doesn’t invite anybody. There are only threats.” Of course, the Monroe Doctrine never went away, it has just waxed and waned. During the first two decades of this century, it took a back seat as Washington focused on executing its War on Terror in the Middle East. As it squandered trillions of dollars spreading mayhem and death and breeding a whole new generation of terrorists, China began snapping up Latin American resources, in particular food, petroleum and strategic minerals like lithium. But even during this time Washington was able to organise a failed coup d’état against Hugo Chavez’s government in Venezuela (2002) and a successful coup against Manuel Zelaya’s government in Honduras (2009). There was another unsuccessful coup against Venezuela’s Chavista government in 2019 as well as a successful one in Bolivia. The partly self-inflicted downfall of Peru’s socialist leader Pedro Castillo in 2022 also got the prior blessing from Washington’s ambassador in Lima and former CIA agent, Lisa Kenna . By the early 2020s, it was clear that Washington had begun rejigging the Monroe Doctrine, a 202-year old US foreign policy position that opposed European colonialism on the American continent, in order to apply it to its most important strategic rivals of today, including China, Russia, Iran and even Hezbollah. Just this past week, a bipartisan bill titled the “No Hezbollah in Our Hemisphere Act” was introduced to the US Congress seeking to counter the Lebanese terrorist group’s influence in the region. But it is China’s rapid rise in the US’ own “backyard” that is of greatest concern in Washington. Unlike the US, Beijing offers win-win trade and investment deals to national governments in the region. It also does not tend to meddle in internal politics, or at least hasn’t until now, preferring to let the money do the talking. As the former US Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers once admitted, “When a Latin American head of state asked me for something, I lectured them. While I was preaching, the Chinese were building airports.” When it comes to international trade, win-win strategies tend to work far better than the zero sum games pursued by Washington. As China’s influence in the region has grown, it is the US military that has done a lot of the talking. In January 2023, General Laura Richardson, the then-Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), reminded the Atlantic Council of just how important Latin America’s resources are as well as the need to “box out” China and Russia from them. In other words, despite what the Washington Post may claim, the Trump Administration’s attempted shakedown of small and mid-sized Latin American countries does not represent the revival of the Monroe Doctrine. That said, it does represent a significant escalation in that trend, and one that many countries in the region and beyond will be keeping a close eye on — including, of course, China. This time around, China’s government is taking a much harder line against Trump’s aggressive foreign and trade policy, including on the American continent. Last month, the country’s foreign minister Wang Yi warned that Latin America is not the “backyard” of any country amid attempts by the Trump administration to browbeat reengage with countries in the region. “Latin America is the home of the Latin American people, not the backyard of any country,” Wang told Sosa, according to a statement released by Beijing. “China supports Latin American countries in defending their sovereignty, independence, and national dignity.” If anything, China is seeking to intensify its strategic relations with countries in the region, particularly in South America. As the Mexican expert in international relations Brenda Estefan recently wrote last month for American Quarterly, the US may have notched up an early victory in Panama but convincing other countries, particularly in South America, to leave China’s orbit is likely to be more challenging: Beijing currently maintains “strategic partnerships” with 10 of the 11 South American nations it engages with, with Guyana being the only exception, as it maintains only standard bilateral relations… In January, during a visit to Beijing, I met with Chinese business leaders whose inclination to deepen their investments in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, was unmistakable. Our discussions revealed China no longer perceives Latin America as a resource supplier but as a pivotal part of its ambitious global economic agenda… … Brazil—Latin America’s largest economy—is largely a lost cause for Washington, as it has significantly deepened its ties with Beijing. Chinese firms have invested in major infrastructure projects ranging from ports and railways to power grids. China is now Brazil’s largest trading partner, absorbing most of its exports, including soy, beef, coffee, and iron. In 2023, bilateral trade reached a record $181 billion. Moreover, Brazil and China have strengthened their geopolitical ties through BRICS, further complicating Washington’s ability to exert influence. Of all the countries in the region, Peru draws the highest level of Chinese investment relative to GDP. The most significant of these investments was the recently inaugurated deep-water port at Chancay, which is intended to serve as a direct trade link between China and South America. After Trump’s electoral triumph, one of his advisors even proposed imposing tariffs on goods passing through Chancay. Argentina is another interesting case. Before coming to power in late 2023, President Javier Milei talked openly about cutting all ties with China’s “murderous” dictatorship, only to backtrack once in office. There was a simple reason for this: since 2009 Argentina has had a currency swap arrangement with Beijing which has helped to ensure some degree of exchange rate stability for Argentina while also deepening trade between the two countries. Given the sorry state of Argentina’s finances, Milei was in no position to turn his nose up at any outside financing. Indeed, by October 2024, almost exactly a year after telling Tucker Carlson that he would never trade with China due to its government’s left-wing, authoritarian proclivities, Javier Milei had nothing but fond words for the US’ main strategic rival today. “China is a very interesting trading partner,” said Javier Milei, who just a year earlier had described the Chinese government as as “assassin.” They “do not make demands, the only thing they ask is that they not be bothered.” Mexico, Between a Rock and a Hard Place There can be no doubt that the US’s main priority is to drive a very large wedge between Mexico, its largest trade partner, and China, its second largest. According to Norwegian logistics firm Xeneta, the Mexico-China trade route is now the fastest-growing in the world, as China has sought to use Mexico’s fast-growing industrial base as a stepping stone for the US market. Given the extent of economic integration between the US and Mexico, Washington is determined to put an end to this trend. And so far, Mexico has buckled each time the US has applied pressure. Last April, the AMLO government announced hundreds of “temporary” tariffs on imports from countries with whom it does not have a trade agreement. The tariffs were imposed on 544 imported products, including footwear, wood, plastic, electrical material, musical instruments, furniture, and steel, and ranged from 5% to 50% in size. They had one clear target in mind: imports from China though the word “China” was not mentioned once in the decree. While the growing deployment of protectionist measures in Mexico, largely at the behest of the US, has elicited rare criticism in the Mexican business press, it seems that the Claudia Sheinbaum government is poised to continue this policy. From Bloomberg: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would review tariffs on Chinese shipments, a move that could give the Trump administration a win in its push to build a “Fortress North America” that blocks shipments from the Asian nation. “We have to review the tariffs that we have with China,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference Thursday. She pointed to Mexico’s problems in textile and shoe production, saying: “Much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country.” The comments come after President Donald Trump offered major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners, by exempting goods from those nations that are covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25% tariffs. There’s a clear logic behind this. For a start, the economies of Mexico and the US are already so intertwined that trying to disentangle them will be an ungodly task. A staggering 83% of Mexico’s exports, many of which are goods assembled by US manufacturers in Mexican maquiladoras, go to the US. If a large part of those supply chains was threatened, the result for Mexico would be a deep economic crisis with millions losing their jobs, which in turn would endanger the ruling party MORENA’s entire economic project. As I’ve noted in previous pieces, Mexico is caught in the middle of a titanic duel between the world’s two rival economic superpowers. While Brazil’s Lula may have invited Claudia Sheinbaum to the next BRICS meeting, the chances of Mexico becoming a BRICS nation any time soon is still razor thin, even as the Trump administration does everything it can to dynamite the USMCA trade deal, and its constituent economies. For one thing, it will take years for Mexico to pivot its economy away from the US. Also, as AMLO said last year, Mexico’s geographic reality simply means it has little choice in the matter: We cannot shut ourselves off, we cannot break up, we cannot isolate ourselves. It is a fact that we have 3,800 kilometres of shared border, for reasons of geopolitics (presumably in reference to the US’ invasion, occupation and appropriation of more than half of Mexico’s territory in the mid-19th century). With all due respect, we are not a European country, nor are we Brazil. We have this neighbourhood and, furthermore, if we agree on things, as we have done, we can help each other out… However, helping out the US essentially means hitching Mexico’s economy to a declining superpower that appears to be on the verge of inflicting upon itself — and by extension, large parts of the world — a severe economic crisis while at the same time adopting an increasingly belligerent approach to adversaries and allies alike. This time around, however, China is adopting a tougher response to US and broader Western provocations. Just a few days ago, Beijing imposed a 100% tariff on Canadian rapeseed oil, oilcake and peas and a 25% tariff on aquatic products and pork from Canada as a retaliation for Ottawa’s escalating tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars and other products. While Mexico’s exports to China are negligible, representing just over 2% of the total, a chill on diplomatic and commercial relations with China will mean even greater dependence on the big neighbour to the North as well as loss of influence in the Global South, which is just how Washington wants it. BlackRock’s Takeover of Panama Canal Is First Major Victory for Trump’s “Americas First” Policy, It is also a major victory for Wall Street. So the obvious, to me, is to ask the question victory for whom? “America First” you say, Wall Street? Are the two the same or divergent? That There can be no denying it: the deal is a major geopolitical victory for the Trump administration… I’m ready to concede if it is the U.S. flexing its military/financial/ political influence in this hemisphere viz-a-viz China. A victory for those Americans on Soc. Sec. and under a insufferable burden of debt, living precariously from day-to-day, victory? ah…not so much. Woodrow Wison wrote: “Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, the flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed against him must be battered down. Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted, in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused.” It is, in much the same terms, Lenin’s theory of imperialism. In whatever terms, both Trump and Xi understand this. Yes, and of course the most notorious period of Latin American intervention was the post WW2 Cold War when our FP elites were allegedly fighting communism–a mere idea–rather than a trading rival. Many of us thought back then that Reagan was doing in Latin America what he and the MIC would do in this country if they could get away with it. Perhaps one explanation for today’s world wide elite tolerance of massacres in the ME and Africa is that they keep the colonialist dream alive in the spirit of Pizarro and Cortes and even Columbus. As Madeleine Albright said, “why do we have this giant military if we aren’t going to use it?” Why indeed. Trump of course is waxing nostalgic for the even older McKinley period when the Philippines gained our benevolent attention. But American imperialism was always a mere me too version of what Europe had been doing. After all it was Spain and Portugal who created all those Latin American countries. With luck buying a few ports will satisfy Trump’s urge for territorial glory. Multipolarity is a rational and desirable thing but it is not the historical trend. We couldn’t hardly wait to grant independence to the Philippines just after WW2, that’s how important it was to us, Puerto Rico (‘Rich Door’ in Spanish) is somewhat of a basket case, Cuba has been our sworn enemy going on 65 years now, leaving us with Guam for the win, of our circa 1898 territorial conquests. We weren’t very good at colonialism as it turns out. Europe, on the other hand… Not for nothing has Woodrow Wilson been called one of America’s most evil Presidents. Right down there with Clinton, Cheney (bush) and Obama. Yes, but give Wilson his due. Wisdom resides in changing the things we can change, accepting the things we can’t change, and making money off of the rest. While reading this post, one line stuck out which said ‘the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries.’ I have read this before but I am now wondering how far back that Blackrock has been acquiring ports. Thing is, as soon as Trump got in he was talking about the US seizing places that had shipping lanes go through them (Panama) or had vital shipping lanes go by them (Greenland) and of course the US is setting up bases on places like the Galapagos Islands which also have trade routes go by them. So when you think about it, if you have the government trying to seize control of the world’s shipping routes while at the same time you had US Blackrock buying up strategic ports, it seems that the new strategy of the deep state government is to control the world’s shipping routes to strangle any country that they did not like. So this must be one of those public-private partnerships that you keep on hearing about. /sarc Please stop the hyperventilating. China has been buying up ports. So now the US is catching up? The only difference it is the Trump noisemaking. CK Hutchison Holding is probably laughing all the way to the bank. Panama is in the midst of a crisis over water. Not enough for the canal and local farms, to the degree that it was causing local unrest. So now America which I believe also has a base there gets to be the bad guy water hog. Sure China is buying up ports if not building them and perhaps that reflects the number of engineers in their National People’s Congress. They are all about infrastructure after all. But the point I was trying to make was the combination of controlling trade routes and controlling the ports that they stop off at. Trump wants Greenland for control of shipping routes coming out of the Arctic. All those mineral resources to be mined there would be just to pay for it all. I doubt that this is all a Trump idea but somebody for years now has been feeding him such plans about controlling the world’s shipping routes and ports. If global warming turns the Panama Canal into a dry empty ditch, it won’t even be a shipping route anymore. A railway, perhaps? control as in managing or actual ownership. The ownership can be much murkier and less transparent than this. Read somewhere that from the 11 Trill managed by BlackRock only a fraction is in fact owned by the company. Is it true? CK Hutchinson Holdings is owned by the influential Li family. The patriarch, Li Ka-Shing, who is now retired was once known as the Superman of Asia and had deep links to the Communist Party of China. The Holdings company also still has a very substantial presence in Hong Kong (for example the ubiquitous Watsons shops) and Mainland China. I have a hard time reading this one, because the family knows that it has to stay on the right side of the Communist Party and if the later really wanted these ports, they could have one of the State Owned Companies gobble them ports up, so I think this sale was actually approved by the Chinese government and the next obvious question is to what purpose? To make some money before global warming makes the Panama Canal dry and worthless? ( Dumm Trump doesn’t ” believe in global warming ” so Dumm Trump could never imagine the Panama Canal running out of water). The headline is acrid male bovine faeces of the ilk agent orange loves spouting. BlackRock has not taken over the Panama Canal(s), it only purchased two out of the five port terminals in the country In order to do this BlackRock had to purchase 43 port terminals in a score of countries and seems to have overpaid for a package it cannot even operate because it lacks the expertise. Swiss based MSC will operate these terminals. BTW 38.000 US citizens did not die building the first Panama Canal, only a few hundred. Most were probably mormons who refused to live pissed on gin tonic. Point taken, Mangy Cat, and it’s an important one. Title has been changed. Thanks for the eloquent feedback. Thank you! Yellow fever – the major killer in Panama – is not listed as a disease treated by quinine at drugs.com. I don’t know if it has any such efficacy equivalent to that of malaria. Unlike its effect on plasmodium malariae, the parasite causing malaria, you are correct that quinine is not a treatment for yellow fever. However, like caffeine, quinine is a mosquito repellent, these critters being the vectors of both diseases. I have no data on the epidemiology while the US built the canal but during the De Lesseps venture both malaria and yellow fever were severe problems. In the generation between the French and US ventures the mosquito was found to be the vector. Together with the decision to build lacks rather than at sea level contributed to the success of the canal. Thank you, Nick. The Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) link caught my attention. Some, but not all, of the private sector attendees are involved with the British government’s attempt to reboot, really privatise, the UK. Sometimes, a storied UK firm is invited as a token, like Schroders a fortnight or so ago, but these US giants are in the driving seat. This is why I think the UK will continue to triangulate between the EU and US. In addition, with an election defeat not unlikely in 2029, Labour politicians will need a golden parachute. They have to suck up to US big finance. There is no doubt in my mind that CK Hutchinson believe the have sold Blackrock a pig in a poke. I doubt they would have been allowed to make the sale by the CCP if the latter believed it was AT WORST geopolitically neutral. As Yves pointed out above, Panama is hurting badly for water, and China is better positioned to operate without the Canal. Expect to see more >Panamax ships sliding out of Chinese shipyards soon. Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service Trains More recently Sheinbaum dramatically increased funding: The story was different, however, for the Isthmus of Tehuantepec rail project, which seeks to develop an overland rail alternative to the Panama Canal [see “Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service,” Trains News Wire, Dec. 23, 2023]. Reflecting that project’s potential economic and logistic benefits, its funding saw a 703.5% increase, from 3.9 billion pesos ($190 million) to more than 31.5 billion pesos ($1.53 billion). Double tracking the line and running double stack container trains could easily handle several million containers a year with efficient sorting at either end. With Panama’s water problems, increased transit tolls and Blackstone running the ports, this project may have promise for Mexico. Thanks for bringing this up, upstater. We actually covered this story back in 2023. Have added a couple of additional paragraphs to this piece on the issue as well as a wee hat-tip in your direction. Since it is acknowledged that most of the fenanyl comes in by ship, does this mean Blackrock will face 25% tariffs unless they get it under control? In the medium and long run, if Chinese ships use the North East Route to reach the North Atlantic and then go down the eastern seabord of Americas, do theyyy even need the Panama Canal. What are the distances involved, and the dangers for chocking for one traditional route (passing the island chains around China into Pacific and then the Pacific into Panama and Atlantic) compared to the other (NER under Russian security umbrella then down to North Atlantic and so on? I have the feeling that Yves is quite right and Hutchinson Holdings is laughing on their way to the bank… Your email address will not be published.

Title: BlackRock First: How the World’s Largest Asset Manager is Gaining More Control Over America Under Trump

Editor Economy Bryan Lutz, Dollar Collapse “I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and to bid defiance to the laws of their country.” ~ Thomas Jefferson Written by Bryan Lutz, Editor at Dollarcollapse.com: The corporate world is a fascinating one. Contrast it with the political one and you can find a new, curious perspective. Much of the political world pretends to own corporations, but in reality corporations tend to run the world. Here’s how it works: Governments like to regulate industries, make claims on natural resources, and force the ownership of certain operations. But in the end, it is the corporations that are producing the work. Governments do not produce. However, there is one trick governments use to claim some part in the production of real things… It is to claim ownership over the currency. Once the government becomes the person defining trade and the value of a currency they have much more control over what private corporations can and cannot do. They essentially make any demand they want because corporations must operate using their currency. But things change if one of these two things happen: Imagine if corporations started buying gold and then they put that gold on their balance sheet. Eventually, corporations would have a valid reason to start trading outside of the State currency. And then there’s the other radical alternative… Some corporations, Blackrock for example, are buying Bitcoin and other crypto to place it on their balance sheet. Recently, BlackRock made some interesting changes to their portfolio buying up a lot of Bitcoin for themselves, and investing in their own iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF during Bitcoin’s latest dip. BNN Bloomberg reports: BlackRock Adds Its Bitcoin ETF to Model Portfolio for First Time “The world’s biggest asset manager is finally allowing Bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio universe. BlackRock Inc. is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, according to an investment outlook viewed by Bloomberg… …The move by BlackRock comes as Bitcoin prices crater alongside stocks, with a toxic brew of economic concerns and trade tensions weighing on risk appetite. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $83,000, after reaching nearly $110,000 last month. Bitcoin’s famed volatility is a core reason why the asset manager mapped out a 1% to 2% weighting as a “reasonable range” in a December paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute. At the time it added that anything beyond 2% would sharply increase crypto’s share of overall portfolio risk.” Only a few days later, Trump announces a “Strategic Crypto Reserve.” And that launched Bitcoin back up another 10%. That is not only a favor for American freedom (as marketed to the public)… It is an effort on the US federal government’s part to control emerging currencies and therefore, the corporations that operate with them, but… Who really benefits from Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve? CNBC reports: Trump announces strategic crypto reserve including bitcoin, Solana, XRP and more “Cryptocurrencies rallied on Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the creation of a strategic crypto reserve for the United States that will include bitcoin and ether, as well as XRP, Solana’s SOL token and Cardano’s ADA. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” he said in a post on Truth Social. “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.” “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he said in a follow-up post. “I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” XRP surged 33% after the announcement while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano’s coin soared more than 60%. Bitcoin rose 10% to $94,343.82, after dipping to a three-month low under $80,000 on Friday. Ether, which has suffered some of the biggest losses in crypto year-to-date, gained 13%.” So who benefited from the Strategic Crypto Reserve the most? Those corporations that hold Bitcoin, and other cryptos… And those corporations that are also big enough to own a whole lot of real things. For example, Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock’s power, wealth, and control continue to grow to staggering heights. Here’s their most recent purchase… Bloomberg reports: BlackRock’s Ports Deal Marks New Reach, Hands Win to Trump “BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for US President Donald Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. The world’s biggest asset manager led a consortium that will buy a controlling stake in Panama ports that had become a political lightning rod and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. CK Hutchison, the conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said it would receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale. CK Hutchinson shares jumped as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the most in 27 years. The deal is a major victory for Trump, who had argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US.” Can you see now? Trump’s “America First” policies and business like administrative style are putting corporations, especially BlackRock First. If you’re still not seeing what’s happening here… Bloomberg exposes: Fink Phoned Trump Directly to Pitch BlackRock’s Panama Deal “Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades.” Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Equator closes $55M fund to bring more private capital to African climate tech | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us African venture capital firm Equator has raised $55 million for its first fund, which will back climate tech startups through one of the most difficult and often overlooked phases in their journey: the early stage. Climate tech startups in African countries have to navigate a tougher funding landscape than their counterparts in more developed economies, where governments often subsidize companies working on greener technologies. They have to instead rely heavily on development finance institutions (DFIs), foundations, and endowments, making them especially vulnerable to shifts in global capital flows. As aid and development finance budgets shrink, DFIs deploy less capital, which adds to the pressure on African startups. The situation is worse for climate tech companies, which require more capital than traditional tech startups. With its fund, Equator feels it can bridge this gap and back scalable solutions that can attract private capital. “We are needed more than ever to invest in technology and scalable ventures tackling fundamental climate challenges,” said the firm’s managing partner, Nijhad Jamal. “These investments will help reduce dependence on aid and instead bring more global private capital into the region.” That’s a lofty goal to aim for, but like many Africa-focused funds, Equator’s base of limited partners still is composed of the very institutions it aims to wean startups off. Its backers include DFIs such as British International Investment (BII), Proparco, and IFC, as well as foundations and endowments like the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (funded by IKEA, Rockefeller, and Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund) and the Shell Foundation. Equator plans to invest the fund in 15 to 18 startups, writing $750,000 to $1 million checks for companies at the seed stage and $2 million for those at Series A. Aside from capital, the firm wants to help founders figure out unit economics, governance, and regional expansion. The fund wants to also reserve capital for follow-on investments and later-stage rounds, and aims to mobilize its LPs as co-investors to bring in equity, debt, or blended financing. “In several of our portfolio companies, we’re the only Africa-focused investor on the cap table — that’s the role we see ourselves playing in this ecosystem,” Jamal said. “Until our most recent investments, we had a 100% success rate in bringing our investors directly into the ventures we backed.” Africa accounts for less than 3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions but bears some of the harshest climate impacts. Equator wants to address that, saying it invests in ventures “addressing economic and sustainability challenges emerging from these impacts.” When we covered the firm in 2023 after it had reached the first close for this fund, Jamal stressed the importance of backing technical founders building in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors. At the time, investments in climate tech had surged, making it Africa’s No. 2 VC sector after fintech. The market has changed since then, however, and investor conversations have evolved alongside those changes. Initially, founders and investors mainly focused on impact; now, Jamal says, the emphasis is shifting to sales — climate solutions must deliver clear economic value to customers with purchasing power. Listing examples of such solutions, Jamal pointed to electric vehicles that cost less than fuel-powered ones; climate insurance that accurately covers extreme weather; or AI-powered logistics optimization for businesses. Some of Equator’s portfolio companies, Roam Electric, Ibisa, and Leta, are building these solutions. “The narrative has shifted,” Jamal said. “It’s no longer just about development and impact. It’s about mobilizing private capital for scalable ventures that solve problems. The focus today is even more on things like unit economics and the path to profitability, because people know there isn’t just [enough] capital to throw at ventures to scale without thinking about monetization, real economics, profitability, or exits.” Jamal feels climate tech startups today are different from their first-generation clean tech counterparts like Sun King, M-KOPA, and d.light, which raised billions and are now looking ready for IPOs. These new startups, he said, operate in a more mature ecosystem, allowing them to use capital and time more efficiently — key factors in becoming attractive acquisition targets. Rather than billion-dollar IPOs, Jamal anticipates $100 million exits, saying that can still deliver strong returns for investors. The space is already seeing some consolidation, though most of it is undisclosed. We did see notable M&A, like Bboxx’s acquisition of PEG Africa in 2022, and more recently, Equator-backed SteamaCo merged with Shyft Power Solutions last year. As the sector hopes to see more exits, Jamal stressed the importance of capital structuring. Climate tech attracted the most debt financing last year, and he argues startups need the right mix to avoid excessive equity dilution. “If equity is used for everything, including working capital, dilution will be too high for investors or founders to see meaningful returns. But as debt and other financial instruments become more available, we’ll start seeing commercial exits, even if they’re more bite-sized,” he said. Jamal previously held roles at BlackRock and impact investor Acumen Fund, where he led the clean tech group. He later founded Moja Capital, a personal fund through which he made early-stage investments aligned with Equator’s current strategy. He runs Equator alongside partner Morgan DeFoort. One of Jamal’s early bets was SunCulture, a Kenya-based, off-grid solar company backed by the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Equator has since supported. Equator has also invested in other growth-stage startups like SoftBank-backed Apollo Agriculture and Odyssey Energy Solutions.

One of these was a solar module manufacturer named Solarium Green Energy, and the other a battery maker—Maxvolt Energy Industries—with the combined valuation at a modest $18 million. For context, 2024 saw a total of 14 listings in transition sectors. In the second half of the year alone, the Indian market saw transition IPOs worth over $2.3 billion. Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources as saying the immediate outlook for transition IPOs was not too bright, with bankers recommending valuations up to 30% lower than the numbers sought by company executives. “Growth is slowing,” Edward Lees, co-manager of BNP Paribas’ Emerging Markets Environmental Solutions fund, told Bloomberg. “People are just less tolerant of this idea of having to pay a green premium.” Also, Lees said, investors are paying more attention to the profitability of such companies now than they used to. In India specifically, there are also other problems that are turning into obstacles to IPO activity. One of these is failure on the part of alternative energy developers to secure long-term deals with buyers. Bloomberg again reported earlier this month that a growing number of wind and solar installations were having trouble securing offtake agreements with regional grid operators, as established by climate change outlet the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As much as 35 GW worth of new projects were waiting to sign such offtake agreements with grid operators amid bureaucratic delays and expectations that wind and solar power prices would be on a consistent downward curve. Even so, the outlook, at least per BloombergNEF, is bright, with new installations this year expected to break a record.

Title: Eric Schmidt named CEO of a rocket startup. It could put him in competition with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

Another billionaire has entered the rocket race. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has provided "substantial financial backing" and has become the CEO of rocket startup Relativity Space, its outgoing leader Tim Ellis said Monday. The company, which was the first to send 3D printed rockets into space, is building reusable flight hardware and has a long-term goal of building an industrial base on Mars. Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 until 2011 and was Alphabet's executive chairman until 2017, joins as the company aims to launch its Terran R launch vehicle in the next couple of years. The company said in a YouTube video posted Monday the vehicle is now in the design process. It launched its Terran 1 rocket in 2023, but it failed to reach orbit. Relativity Space declined to comment further when reached by Business Insider. "I know there's no one more tenacious or passionate to propel this dream forward," Ellis, also the cofounder of the company, said in an X post on Monday, adding that he'll transition to the company's board. Some of the company's eventual ambitions run parallel to those of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. Under Schmidt's leadership, Relativity Space's rockets could compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Blue Origin's New Glenn and New Shepherd rockets, as Relativity Space aims to create reusable rockets. The company, which was founded about a decade ago, is also known for using 3D printing to produce its rockets. In 2023, Relativity Space made history by sending the first rocket that was mostly 3D printed into space, though it did not reach orbit. The company has since expanded its focus beyond 3D printing and is also incorporating more traditional methods to produce its rockets. Relativity Space was valued at more than $4 billion in 2021, with investors that included BlackRock, Fidelity, and Mark Cuban. Jump to

Title: Panama Canal weighs pipeline to move gas, with eye on Asian clients

Business FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun//File Photo (C) By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY : The Panama Canal is exploring the construction of a pipeline to move liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the trade passage, canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez said on Monday, with Japan seen as a top potential client for gas coming from the U.S. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The canal, one of the world's busiest maritime trade passages, is looking to diversify its operations after getting the greenlight in a court ruling last year. A drought limited crossings and canal officials are planning to build a reservoir nearby. Japan is one of the world's largest LPG customers, using the fuel for domestic and industrial use. KEY QUOTE "We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger," Vasquez told Reuters following a press conference. "Meeting the needs for growing volumes (of gas) through Panama is of the highest priority, but also of the highest complexity," Vasquez said. CONTEXT The move comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Panama, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's claims about reclaiming the Panama Canal. Despite pushback from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino against Trump's claims, the U.S. leader and officials have hailed a recent deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its assets near the Panama Canal. BY THE NUMBERS Initial studies show that "possible traffic capacity through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd (of LPG) in a decade," Vasquez added. WHAT'S NEXT The canal expects to make a decision about the pipeline in the next 12 months, Vasquez said. Investments of $8 billion in infrastructure and sustainability projects are already earmarked for the canal, spread out over the next decade.

Title: ‘Worst-Case Scenario’: Canada Trades Trudeau For Another … Trudeau

Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:26:53Z

Mark Carney, the newly elected Canadian Liberal Party leader positioned to succeed Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister, may impose familiar far-left policies to the nation already burdened by inflation and regulation, some critics warn. Carney, ex-central banker of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England as well as the former UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, won his party’s support in a landslide victory Sunday. The new Liberal Party leader was recently appointed to head a Liberal task force on economic growth, with support from Trudeau, who resigned in January following years of economic trouble and a public dispute with President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Liberal Party Chooses Mark Carney As New Canadian PM As Trudeau Era Closes) “This is about a worst-case scenario for Canadians,” Marc Morano, the head of Climate Depot and author of “The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown” told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Morano cited concerns over how a Carney-led government would oppose the latest political and economic trends seen in Argentina, the United States and most recently, Germany, to instead “hammer consumers” and “double down on the green agenda.” “It’s as if he’s looked at the world the last five years and completely ignored reality,” Morano continued. Morano described Carney as “Justin Trudeau 2.0” and a “power player” that supports “corporate government collusion,” even comparing him to “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in terms of his power, expertise, connections and ability.” Canada’s Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre now faces a reinvigorated Liberal Party, though he’s led in the polls since October, according to CBC News. “Liberals are trying to trick Canadians into electing them for a fourth term by replacing Trudeau with his economic advisor, Mark Carney,” Poilievre said on X in response to Carney’s victory. Carney is a staunch supporter of green energy policies and has vowed to “reward Canadians for making greener choices, such as purchasing an energy efficient appliance, electric vehicle, or improved home insulation,” though he also promises to cut the country’s carbon tax, which has been described as “very unpopular,” according to a campaign press release. The Liberal Party leader has a long record of supporting green energy policies, even if they conflict with the flow of the free market. “Achieving net zero emissions will require a whole economy transition – every company, every bank, every insurer and investor will have to adjust their business models,” Carney said at the COP26 UN climate talks in 2020. “This could turn an existential risk into the greatest commercial opportunity of our time,” he claimed. “Canada’s current climate policy has become too divisive,” a press release from Mark Carney’s campaign also reads. “We need a climate policy that is unifying, credible, and predictable—to reduce emissions, drive investment, and build an economy for the future.” During his victory speech in Ottawa, Carney also said that “Donald Trump is trying to weaken [Canada’s] economy. But there’s someone else who, if he succeeds, will weaken our economy. It’s Pierre Poilievre. … A lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.” “Pierre Poilievre’s plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,” Carney continued. “Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him.” Carney has spoken out against Trump’s tariffs on Canadian imports, writing on X that they are “unjustified” on Thursday. The Trump administration argues that these tariffs are in response to the “flow of fentanyl” into the U.S. from Canada, further adding, “the situations at our Northern and Southern borders continue to require appropriate action from the Governments of Canada and Mexico.” Canada’s strong response to the unjustified US tariffs is having an impact. I am proud of the united front of workers, labour, businesses, federal and provincial governments that is helping Canada to navigate through this crisis. Today’s announcement is not enough. All tariffs… — Mark Carney (@MarkJCarney) March 6, 2025 “The world is absolutely going in the opposite direction from everything Carney stands for,” Morano said. He noted that Carney is “poised now to wreak this hellscape on Canadians,” potentially forwarding policies that will cause prices and restrictions to soar. “It’s easier to transition your gender than it is our energy supply,” Morano said. He asserted that clean energy power supply comes at a “higher cost, and it’s not green.” The author pointed to the fact that it takes 45 tons of non-renewable plastic to make one wind turbine. Morano also questioned green energy’s profitability, suggesting that if clean energy alternatives were profitable, green energy policies wouldn’t need to be mandated or subsidized. “Why do they have to ban the competition? … Why did you have to mandate them? Why did you have to subsidize them? Why are they the weakest points of energy output?” Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in January after nine years in office and a sharp decline in approval ratings. Since 2015, Canada’s national debt has nearly doubled, Bloomberg reported, prompting citizens’ increased discontent with the state of the economy. Canadians cited the cost of living as their biggest concern that they wanted members of Parliament in the next session to focus on, according to an Ipsos poll taken in September.

Title: Eric Schmidt joins Relativity Space as CEO | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt’s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago. On Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that he made a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported. Schmidt is succeeding the startup’s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In a post on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company’s board. Schmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up for the 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R’s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported. Schmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google’s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins. Now, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company’s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches. Relativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan to launch the first private space mission to Mars by 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones. In 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R. The Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 and struggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity. While running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry — from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin — it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.

Shandong Yulong Petrochemical started up its first crude processing unit of 200,000 bpd in September 2024. This unit has kept crude processing rates at 90% of capacity since November. Now the refiner, whose refining and chemicals complex is worth $20 billion, is set to begin trial runs at the second crude unit of another 200,000 bpd at the end of March, according to the trading sources who spoke to Reuters. The new refining unit could raise crude oil imports in the world’s top crude buyer after recent slumps due to tepid domestic fuel demand. But more fuel production could also depress already weak refining margins in China and the region. Faced with a hectic reorganization of the crude trade following the U.S. sanctions on Russia, Shandong Yulong Petrochemical has reportedly boosted purchases of West African and Brazilian crude in recent weeks. The Chinese refiner last month bought four shipments of crude from Angola and Nigeria a trade source familiar with the deals told Reuters in February. Shandong Yulong Petrochemical booked a cargo each of Angola’s Dalia, Plutonio, and Girassol crude and one cargo of Nigeria’s Nemba, all for delivery in March. The Chinese refiner has also bought two shipments of crude from Brazil for delivery in April, according to the source. At the same time, China’s crude oil imports over the first two months of the year fell by 5% compared to the same period of 2024 as the parting round of sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Russian energy affected international flows.

Sarah Healy Age: 24 Club: UCD Athletics Club The first time Sarah Healy heard Amhrán na bhFiann play out after her victory on the track, the assumption was she wouldn’t be waiting too long to hear it again. And she wasn’t, as two days after winning the 3,000m at the European Under-18 Championships in Gyor, Hungary in July 2018, Healy also won the 1,500m. Then came a series of near misses after running from the front – second in the 1,500m at the under-20 championships in 2019, second again at the under-23 championships in 2023, narrowly beaten by Sophie O’Sullivan – before some seven years later, Healy did get to hear Amhrán na bhFiann again after she won the 3,000m at the European Indoor Championships on Sunday. 🇮🇪☘️ Sarah Healy’s gold medal-winning moment in the 3000m. 🥹#Apeldoorn2025 pic.twitter.com/hy6pZy0nI4 It was a historic win for Irish athletics, Healy the first Irish woman to win gold at these championships which have been running since 1970, but it was deeply satisfying in a personal sense, given some of the setbacks she has endured. Healy choose to stay home rather than pursue a US scholarship, studying law at UCD while also adjusting to competing in the senior grade. Equally committed to her academics, graduating in 2023 with honours, she was by her own admission often prone to losing concentration in her races. In May 2022, she ran a world-class time of 4:02.86 for 1,500m at the at the World Athletics Continental Tour gold meeting in Ostrava, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record of 4:05.81 set 31 years previously in Monaco. But at the 2022 European Cross-Country Championships she suffered a bone stress fracture in her foot, requiring a lengthy lay-off. Still, Healy never lost her focus on where she wanted to go. After being carefully nurtured by her coach Eoghan Marnell at Blackrock AC, they realised the need to go beyond the big fish in the small pond scenario, and Healy moved to the husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, based in Wigan, whose group included Keely Hodgkinson, who won gold in the 800m at the Paris Olympics. There’s a newfound confidence and consistency about Healy’s running since, and nowhere was that more evident than in Apeldoorn on Sunday, where she held her nerve to hit the front for the first time inside the last 50m, right when it matters most. Mark English Age: 31 Club: Finn Valley AC They sometimes say your sport chooses you, not the other way around, and things might have been different had Mark English not been spotted winning the egg and spoon race at his school sports day in Letterkenny. For a while after English continued to focus on Gaelic football, playing with Letterkenny Gaels, encouraged by Colm McFadden – former All Star, current Donegal selector and one of English’s teachers at St Eunan’s College. English however soon realised his true potential was in athletics, particularly the 800m which requires that delicate combination of speed and endurance. Still he stayed close to Donegal football, standing in Hill 16 when they won the All-Ireland in 2012. That was the same year English lowered his 800m best to 1:45.77, the fastest under-20 time in Europe in 2012, just .17 shy of the Olympic A-standard for the London Olympics. Athletics Ireland choose not to nominate him on the B-standard, and at the time that hurt. Despite several enticing offers to take up a US scholarship, including at Villanova, English choose to stay at home, opting for UCD. Originally enrolling in physiotherapy, he later transferred to medicine, studying alongside Jack McCaffrey, where the talk was who might be the fastest in that class (Note: there would only be one winner). He won his first Irish senior title indoors in 2011, aged 17, and now, 14 years later and a qualified doctor, English has repeatedly broken the Irish 800m record indoors and out, and is still running stronger, faster, and more determined than ever. His bronze medal in the 800m on Sunday was his fifth European medal in all, making him the most decorated male athlete in the history of Irish athletics. Kate O’Connor Age: 24 Club: Dundalk St Gerards AC It was at the time seen as one small step for Irish athletics, and one giant leap for Kate O’Connor, who in winning the heptathlon silver medal at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships in Boras, Sweden back in 2019, first wrote her own little piece of history. No Irish woman had ever won a championship medal at any level in the heptathlon, the seven-event disciple demanding all-round talent and athleticism, and O’Connor had already made sure of it going into the final event, the 800m. The then 18-year-old from Dundalk St Gerard’s Athletics Club, coached by her father Michael, was racing to determine which colour, and in the end was rewarded with silver, her total of 6,093 points also smashing the existing Irish senior record, the first time any Irish woman had surpassed 6,000 points. O’Connor later won silver at the Commonwealth Games in 2022, representing Northern Ireland, and last summer in Paris became Ireland’s first representative in the Olympic heptathlon, finishing 14th. Still, Sunday’s bronze in the pentathlon – the indoor, five-event version of the women’s heptathlon – was another giant leap, given O’Connor jumped from fourth to third in the last event winning the 800m outright in 2:11.42. It was the first medal won by any Irish athlete in a senior multi-event. Her 800m time at was enough to bring the 24-year-old’s total to 4781 points, improving again on her previous Irish indoor record of 4683 set last month. Her father still oversees much of her training along with Tom Reynolds, and she’s currently dividing her time between Dundalk and Belfast, where she’s completing a Masters in Communications and Public Relations at Ulster University. The outdoor season and her return to the heptathlon now promises even more.

Title: Wall Street Is Quietly Hinting At Major Ideological Shift Toward Bitcoin This Year

ByDan Runkevicius ByDan Runkevicius , Senior Contributor. President Trump Trump with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House crypto czar David Sacks. On his first day in office, Trump made a bold promise: Bitcoin will have regulatory clarity by midyear. Soon after, the Jan. 23 executive order followed, directing the nation’s top policymakers — from the Treasury secretary and SEC chair to the CFTC chair and attorney general — to find a way to integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. Even ruling out edge cases like a full-fledged “national bitcoin reserve,” Trump’s wishlist, detailed in the order, marks the most aggressive pro-crypto push in Bitcoin’s history. And there’s already progress. Right after taking office, Trump’s appointed acting SEC chair, Mark Uyeda, revoked SAB 121, an accounting rule that forced banks to put crypto on their balance sheets, making custody impractical. What actually comes out of Trump’s pro-crypto push is still unclear, but Wall Street looks eager to call it a done deal. From financial advisor surveys and money flows to Wall Street’s recent investments, a mounting pile of data points to a major ideological shift about Bitcoin at an institutional level—one that goes beyond empty talk. On Jan. 14, 2024, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, giving institutional investors a backdoor into Bitcoin. These funds solved three key problems that had kept big money on the sidelines: compliance, tax inefficiencies, and custody. For the first time, institutions could buy Bitcoin as easily as the S&P 500. The result is nearly $113 billion in inflows in under a year—representing about 10% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Demand was so off the charts that Bitcoin outpaced every other asset class — including its ideological rival gold — becoming the fastest-growing ETF debut ever. In the first three trading days, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $10 billion. For perspective, gold took nearly three years to hit that mark in the early 2000s. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called it “insane.” Since its launch, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust — the first spot Bitcoin ETF — has collected $53 billion in assets, making it the fastest ETF to hit the $50 billion mark. “I wasn’t sure we’d ever see it, but I’ve never seen anything like it in my career, something going from $0 to $50 billion in basically six months,” BlackRock CFO Martin Small said earlier this month at the Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference. Within their first year, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up more than $100 billion in assets. Considering that gold ETFs ended last month with $306 billion in assets, Bitcoin is already a third of the way toward matching gold in terms of ETF safe-haven demand. This isn’t just a retail-driven frenzy. According to SEC fillings, institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs has tripled over the last quarter from $12.4 billion to $38.7 billion. That’s in stark contrast to a 69% rise from retail investors, according to Fintel. Ironically, “institutions are perhaps the only investors that remain excited about cryptocurrency right now,” Nic Puckrin, founder of Coin Bureau, told me. And there may be good reason why. Not long ago, Wall Street slammed Bitcoin as the biggest fad in history. Warren Buffett famously called it “rat poison squared,” and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon dismissed it as “worse than tulip bulbs.” But many fund managers who once wrote off Bitcoin have changed their tune. BlackRock and Fidelity have both issued Bitcoin ETFs. Goldman Sachs quietly bought up $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs in 2014. In April 2022, Fidelity became the first firm to let employees add Bitcoin to their 401(k) accounts. Last year, Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street bank to allow its advisors to offer Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Yet, most money managers still scoff at Bitcoin due to its volatility and regulatory uncertainty. A 2024 CoinShares survey found that nearly two-thirds (62%) of financial advisors believe recommending Bitcoin conflicts with their fiduciary duty. That may soon change because Bitcoin is becoming too significant to ignore. On a recent webinar, Cathie Wood called Bitcoin a promising new asset class that money managers now have “some fiduciary responsibility” to understand, even in its early stages. While the number of advisors actually allocating crypto to client portfolios remains small, it’s growing fast. The latest Bitwise and VettaFi survey found that 22% of financial advisors started allocating crypto in client accounts in the past year—twice the rate in 2023 and a record high for the poll. For context, that’s not far from gold. A recent Bank of America study found that 71% of U.S. financial advisors have little to no gold allocation, often keeping it below 1% of portfolios. Even BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — is making a case for Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier akin to gold as the traditional stock-bond correlation continues to break down. “The erratic correlation between stock and bond returns has defined the new regime — and government bonds have become a less reliable cushion against equity selloffs as a result,” BlackRock analysts wrote. “We see the potential for other diversifiers — old like gold and new like Bitcoin — to step in.” As of today, all crypto held by institutional investors — including Bitcoin in ETFs and brokers that allow digital asset trading — is stored with crypto-native firms rather than traditional banks. Coinbase dominates this space. Of the 11 SEC-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024, Coinbase serves as custodian for nine funds, controlling 86.4% of total ETF assets under management. That raises concentration risk, not to mention the fact that institutional investors remain wary of crypto-native firms, regardless of their size, given high-profile collapses like FTX and security breaches at firms like Bybit. To address this, Wall Street banks are stepping in to pick up the baton. Citi and State Street — the world’s second- and fourth-largest custodians — announced they will offer crypto custody services next year. This isn’t just another sign of crypto’s maturation. It’s also one of the biggest wins from recent regulatory shifts, including the revocation of SAB 121, a rule that forced banks to put digital assets on their balance sheets. Keeping assets off the balance sheet is what makes traditional asset custody safer and also more cost-effective. It reduces reserve requirements for custodians and lowers liquidation risk for asset owners if a custodian goes bust. “Asset managers have to put their assets with some sort of custodian, but with crypto, they do not currently have the ability to place large amounts in banks because of limitations like SAB 121,” according to a legal executive at a bank interviewed in an article by John Crabb for Institutional Investor. “If these limitations go away, asset managers will have more options — they could still use a non-bank custodian for crypto assets, but they would also have the choice of a chartered bank.” Another telltale sign of crypto’s evolution as an institutional asset is Wall Street’s willingness to become liquidity providers. Rumor has it that Citadel — the largest market maker on Wall Street — is preparing to enter the digital asset market. If true, it would be the first traditional market maker to provide liquidity in crypto. According to sources familiar with the matter, as first reported by Bloomberg, Citadel wants to join major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Crypto.com. This move follows Citadel’s 2023 initiative to bypass mainstream crypto exchanges — still deemed too risky for institutional investors due to regulatory uncertainty — and create its own institutional-grade crypto exchange. “Citadel Securities teamed up with brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investments, to form an institution-only crypto exchange that mirrors how assets are held and settled in stock and bond markets. That venue, EDX Markets, went live in 2023 and offers crypto trading exclusively for institutional investors,” wrote Katherine Doherty of Bloomberg. Out of fear of missing out, even the most conservative institutional investors are following suit. “Interestingly, several U.S. states are taking significant steps toward Bitcoin adoption, with pension funds in Michigan and Wisconsin already holding crypto, and Pennsylvania approving legislation to allocate up to 10% into Bitcoin,” Jason Yanowitz, a founder of Blockworks, told me. Wisconsin’s state pension fund recently doubled its Bitcoin ETF position to $320 million. Then there’s Michigan, with a $6.6 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs within its $143.9 million pension fund for state employees. Both allocations mark a significant share of their portfolios, substantially higher than BlackRock’s recommendation of a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. Endowments are also hopping on board. Last month, University of Austin announced a $5 million Bitcoin allocation within its $200 million endowment, marking the first dedicated crypto endowment fund in U.S. higher education. Sovereign wealth funds are hopping on the bandwagon, too. Just weeks ago, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, revealed a massive $437 million stake in Bitcoin. It’s now the seventh-largest investor in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF by assets. Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) indirectly owned 2,446 BTC worth around $250 million at the end of the first half of 2024, more than double its holdings from the end of 2023. Then there’s the speculation about Trump’s Bitcoin national reserve. What Trump is proposing is similar to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has already introduced a bill suggesting the U.S. acquire 1,000,000 BTC over five years. It’s a long shot because buying Bitcoin means borrowing, which Trump is trying to avoid. What’s more likely is that he builds a de facto reserve out of the 200,000 BTC confiscated by the federal government, for which Trump signed an executive order last week. Any additional Bitcoin purchases would likely require congressional approval. Even a symbolic move — relabeling seized Bitcoin as a “reserve” — could spark what some economists call a global Bitcoin arms race, triggering another wave of institutional buying, only this time at the state level. No matter how big the push, Trump’s executive powers may not be enough to enact whatever he envisions, even if it’s as simple as reclassifying seized Bitcoin. Moish Peltz, a partner at Falcon Rappaport & Berkman, told CoinDesk after Trump’s victory that the rules surrounding seized Bitcoin might change on a department-by-department basis, depending on how it was confiscated. “Some portion of the seized Bitcoin might need an act of Congress, but not necessarily,” he said. “Trump’s pro-crypto stance has the potential to be a catalyst for transformation, but we need to separate the signal from the noise,” Yanowitz told me. “What the market needs to see moving forward is the administration continuing to push on the policy front.” Despite the uncertainty, the FOMO factor is already evident at the state level. There are already reports — though anecdotal — that other developed nations, including Japan, Russia and China, are actively considering to acquire Bitcoin ahead of a potential U.S. national reserve announcement. Meanwhile, while the Trump administration works on a federal Bitcoin reserve, 15 states — including Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida — are considering or have already introduced bills to add Bitcoin to their treasuries. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming believes states will lead the way. “My bet is that you’ll see a state establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government,” she said at a recent conference hosted by crypto personality Anthony Pompliano in New York, as reported by Bloomberg. At the end of the day, it’s uncertain whether institutions will hold their ground in the face of a broader market sell-off. But one thing is clear: Big money is throwing its weight behind Bitcoin as something that’s here to stay.

businessPersonal Finance By Javier E. DavidBusiness Editor Business Editor A growing number of Texans fear their golden years could turn to lead, with many feeling financially unprepared as retirement draws closer, BlackRock reported on Monday. In a new survey, the world’s largest asset manager found retirement security fears “consume” many in the Lone Star State. Out of about 500 respondents surveyed, BlackRock found that 78% are concerned that the system is leaving too many Americans without sufficient savings to live in old age. About 62% of Texans reported having under $150,000 in retirement savings, BlackRock said. Meanwhile, a slim 22% of employed Texans felt “very confident” in having enough money to last through retirement, the data showed, while nearly half are more concerned about going broke during their golden years than they are dying. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy BlackRock’s findings are consistent with a body of evidence showing widespread retirement insecurity, especially with the solvency of Social Security a big question mark as more depart the workforce. Costlier living expenses driven by inflation have exacerbated the problems. In a 2021 report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that Texas “has a high share of population groups that tend to struggle with retirement savings,” including low-wage workers, people of color (specifically Hispanics) and rural residents. The data suggests that Americans in general — and Texans in particular — “are not as prepared as they need to be for retirement,” the Dallas Fed’s researchers wrote. For those over 45, available figures show that average retirement account balances lag far behind levels considered comfortable enough to retire. BlackRock’s survey respondents felt $2.1 million was the magic number they’d need to live comfortably after retiring; however, not even 30% have personally stocked away enough to do so. The problem is growing more acute, as more Baby Boomers retire and the first wave of Generation X turns 60 in 2025 — with retirement not far off. According to Fidelity data, Baby Boomers are considered the most financially secure, with the average 401K balance at $249,000, with the average individual retirement account carrying a balance of about $257,000. But for Gen X, reality is starting to bite. The average 401K for that cohort is just over $192,000, according to Fidelity, with the average IRA barely over $100,000. BlackRock found that among the Texans they surveyed, Gen Xers were indeed the most anxious, with 60% having under $150K in retirement savings. Half of voters in Texas between the ages of 55 and 64 have under $50,000 saved for retirement, the firm noted.

“Everything is bad and will get worse” – Ukraine Serviceman to British Media By Ahmed Adel, March 09, 2025 Ukraine’s Armed Forces have lost the initiative on the battlefield, and even with the resumption of US military aid, the Ukrainians would have little chance of stopping the Russian army’s advances. More Guns, Less Butter: Starmer’s Defence Spending Splash By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, March 09, 2025 Spend, spend, spend is the theme, and the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has shown himself willing to join this wasteful indulgence. On February 25, just prior to his visit to Washington, Starmer announced that spending on defence would reach 2.5% of GDP from April 2027.

Recycling ‘Russiagate’ in Romania By Drago Bosnic, March 09, 2025 Romania has been going through unprecedented instability in the last several months, with the Brussels-run neoliberal dictatorship effectively taking over the country. It could even be described as a “soft coup” orchestrated to nullify the will of the Romanian people. Hamas, Palestine, and Israel By Dr. Vladislav B. Sotirović, March 09, 2025 In essence, any economic prosperity of Palestine directly depends on political relations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities. The Israeli general embargoes are more or less constant and, therefore, limit the available natural resources and economic potentials to be properly used, causing starvation and dehumanization of the Palestinians. Agent Zelensky, Ukraine on Sale. Manlio Dinucci By Manlio Dinucci, March 09, 2025 In 2021 Zelensky, overwhelmed by huge economic problems, changed the law preventing the sale of Ukrainian land and resources to foreign companies.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”

See original: Germany Voted a New Government – What Will Change? By Peter Koenig, February 24, 2025 . On 23 February 2025 advanced elections were held in Germany towards a new Government, as the old Government coalition, the so-called “Traffic Light” – red (Social Democrats), yellow (Free Democratic Party), green (The Greens) – collapsed in early November 2024. This had been expected for some time. The advanced snap elections were no surprise. What came across for many – but not for all — as a surprise was the result of these snap elections. As was expected, the center-right CDU/CSU came out ahead with 28%, considerably less than they expected – they hoped for more than 30%. Second was the relatively new party (founded in 2013) Alternative for Germany (AfD – German acronym) with about 21%. Exit polls apparently indicated that about two-thirds of Germans prefer the values AfD stands for, as compared to those of the broken “traffic light” coalition. Former East Germany voted almost exclusively AfD. AfD is said to be a right-wing party. However, all things considered with reason, AfD is a common sense party, standing for national sovereignty, controlled immigration, anti-war, thus anti-NATO, and possibly considering DEXIT – meaning leaving the European Union, as well as the Euro, for more monetary sovereignty. AfD vouches also for renewed cooperation with Russia, which is a MUST, not just to revive Germany’s economy but to make Europe independent again, with a sovereign track, being able to freely choose her partners not just following the shifting dictate of the United States, and worldwide appearing as a weak vassal of Washington’s. In terms of parliamentary seats (total 630), the result was even stronger for AfD. The winning party CDU/CSU (symbolic color black) will have 208 seats, and the runner up, AfD (blue) has 158 seats, together 360 seats. As a coalition, they would have more than secure absolute majority which is 316. However, and this is where German Un-Reason comes to play, under the mandate of Olaf Scholz, the defunct chancellor, all parties pledged, they would not enter a coalition with AfD under any circumstances because they considered AfD a neo-Nazi party. AfD has been “stonewalled”, as they call it. Germany also pledged they would continue supporting Ukraine’s war against Russia, no matter what Presidents Trump-Putin negotiations come up with. They feel offended and side-kicked for not having been invited to the negotiations. Chancellor Scholz even attempted to forbid the AfD as a party. It did not fly. But how undemocratic! As JD Vance, US Vice President, pointedly said at the Munich Security Conference on 14 February. Prohibiting the second largest party would be an absolute nonsense; just because AfD does not follow the then US President Biden (US neoliberal globalist Democrats) mandate. As if the US would have to set the tone to which Europe may dance. As an anecdote, President Trump congratulated Alice Weidel, co-founder and front person of the AfD party, for her party’s excellent election results. So, the Washington wind has shifted perhaps by as much as 180 degrees. How do “puppets”, 27 of them dis-united under the EU, react? It is an unspoken and unwritten fact that at least half of the EU members would want to share AfD values, however they do not dare say so, except for Viktor Orban from Hungary. They feel too weak to express their opinions, lest they might be punished or sanctioned by the ever-more tyrannical EU leadership. * The likely Chancellor to be, Friedrich Merz, a former executive of BlackRock Germany, leader of the CDU/CSU party, must therefore avoid the “stonewalled” party and start coalition negotiations with the third party, the Social Democrats, Scholz’s party. This may be extremely difficult as ideologically they are far apart. CDU/CSU are much closer to AfD in strategic thinking. In a CDU/CSU-SP alliance, lots on concessions might be needed on both sides. Even if they are willing to make these concessions for the sake of the coalition, nobody knows how long the compromise will last before there will be rifts appearing – and the coalition may fall apart again. Many analysts predict a repeat early election, as they may not even come to an agreement within the next couple of months during which time a new Government should be in place. The target for Mr. Merz is early April, the deadline is more likely early May 2025. For example, one key issue between the two coalition partners-to-be is immigration. Throughout the campaign, Merz and his party talked about controlled immigration. Whereas the Socialists want to keep the doors wide open, à la Joe Biden USA, not even thinking of adjusting it to the new US Administration. In a recent speech, Merz said and repeated, “Here nobody speaks of “controlled Immigration. Our borders are and remain open.” Here we go: first concession! Will it last? Mr. Merz said already in strong terms that he wants an independent Germany and Europe, distancing the bloc from the Trump-USA. This would parallel the fiercely anti-US drive of the unelected EU leadership; the typical deceptive game of the other side of the same coin, a rather primitive approach of Klaus Schwab’s WEF which itself is just a puppet for the forces behind it. Rumors have it, though informally and insinuating confirmed by President Trump’s brilliant State of the Union Address tonight, that he will invite Chancellor-to-be Merz to the White House in the not-too-distant future as he did with France’s Macron ten days ago. Macron may still be nominally pro-Europe, pro-Ukraine war and pro-NATO but since his surreptitious visit to the White Hose, he remains just a lame duck leader of the Big Ones in Europe. Mr. Trump had a conciliatory tone for Europe, calling them friends. Although this may be purely strategic, since Trump wants Europe on his side for rebuilding ties with Russia. Europe will eventually go along because “alone” between the Atlantic Ocean and the great contiguous Eurasian Continent, life might become mighty hard. Conciliatory also in more ways than one. When Mr. Trump was talking about tariffs during his State of the Union speech, he was no longer throwing around these insane rates of 25%, 50% or 100%, but assured the world that tariffs will be reciprocal which sounds like a fair deal. That must be a relief for Europe’s struggling economies. A couple of days ago, Trump also hinted at completing the second phase Nord Stream pipeline [the one that was not blown up, but was never finished], so that Russian gas could again flow to economically wrecked Europe, especially Germany which badly needs cheap energy to revamp her economy. At first, the German Government childishly under false loyalty to the dying Biden-globalists may refuse. But business and industrial pressure will either overturn a resisting government or bring them to reason. On another breaking news, President Trump announced tonight that just before his State of the Union message, he had received a conciliatory letter from Ukraine President Zelensky, telling him he wants Peace and that he wants him, President Trump, to negotiate Peace. This adds a new dimension in the European defiant resistance to Peace. Once Germany calls the tune, the rest of Europe, including the bloc, if by then it had survived, will follow the new trend of a new US of A – which very likely will want a more sovereign Europe, or sovereign European countries, as partners. With Ukraine declaring they want Peace, no longer war, ambitious Merz, rather than risk a re-election and losing, especially after his visit to Washington, where Trump will receive him probably with positive words for AfD, may reconsider breaking the “stonewall” and may be seeking, after all, a coalition with AfD. These predictions are just that, speculations blowing in the wind. In these chaotic days, we must be prepared that our ideas and forward-looking wishes might be overthrown in the glimpse of a second – as counter-chaos may enter the stage anytime. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Agent Zelensky, Ukraine on Sale. Manlio Dinucci

Time Published: 2025-03-09T20:28:27Z

In 2021 Zelensky, overwhelmed by huge economic problems, changed the law preventing the sale of Ukrainian land and resources to foreign companies. So it was that half of Ukraine’s precious black earths and mineral resources ended up in the hands of Monsanto, Cargill, Dupont, controlled by big US funds including BlackRock, Vanguard and Blackstone. We talked about this a year ago on Grandangolo about Scott Ritter’s investigation “Agent Zelensky?”. Scott Ritter, a career US Marine and intelligence specialist, demonstrated intellectual honesty and courage when, as the head of UN inspectors in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, he concluded that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and publicly opposed the 2003 war. His investigative documentary shows the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens. “His puppet masters provided him with a financial cushion” with an initial payment of $41 million. He shows the luxurious villas Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), Israel, Italy in Forte dei Marmi, London, Georgia, Greece and even Crimea (the only bad investment because now Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also demolishes the false narrative that Russia is destroying Ukrainian grain and thus starving Africa. The reality is that Cargill and other multinational agribusinesses are seizing the best Ukrainian land and using the grain produced here for their own strategies. This is part of the US plan to reduce Europe’s food security in order to better control the allied countries themselves. Ukraine – the investigation shows – is not only being robbed of its land, sold by Zelensky and Co. to the multi-nationals, but is also becoming increasingly indebted. The huge military supplies it receives from the US and European superpowers are not given away, but on credit. Ukraine has already accumulated a foreign debt that would take centuries to repay. This debt will grow with the ‘reconstruction’ that Zelensky has put in the hands of the US-based BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. Investigation – not only is it being robbed of its land, sold off to multinationals by Zelensky and his associates, but it is also being plunged further and further into debt. The huge military supplies it receives from the US and the European superpowers are not given away, but given on credit. Ukraine has already accumulated a foreign debt that would take centuries to pay off. This debt will grow with the ‘reconstruction’ that Zelensky has entrusted to the US-based BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: IBIT Vs. FBTC: Which Bitcoin ETF Is The Better Buy?

Time Published: 2025-03-09T19:00:00Z

ByNicolas Straut ByNicolas Straut , Contributor. Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio. Bitcoin Spot ETFs have emerged as a leading way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, which has delivered tremendous returns since its launch in 2009. In 2024, the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allowing retail and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency on stock exchanges alongside other assets like the best stocks for 2025. In this article, you’ll learn the key differences between the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), how they compare in terms of fees, performance, management and security. While these bitcoin ETFs may not be right for some investors like the risk-averse or those who wish to hold bitcoin directly, they can provide exposure to an exciting asset which is rapidly gaining mainstream adoption. Investors may wish to invest in bitcoin in the first place, because of its strong performance, returning 47,116.2%% over the last 10 years and 997.9%% over the last 5 years. Depending on who you ask, bitcoin can serve as a promising speculative asset, an alternative store of value to the fiat currency like gold or a currency as it can serve as a means of exchange. A bitcoin ETF is most suitable for investors who wish to gain exposure to bitcoin as a speculative asset, earning a potential return from the asset’s growth. Bitcoin Spot ETFs like IBIT and FBTC allow investors to invest in bitcoin’s price movements through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to store bitcoin assets themselves. These ETFs provide liquidity, regulatory oversight, and simple trading alongside stocks, bonds and other funds in your portfolio. For investors who only wish to invest in bitcoin and not in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Solana from their existing brokerage account, bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are a good solution, rather than a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase. IBIT and FBTC both track the price movements of bitcoin but with differences in fees, how they’re structured, and their providers. Both of these bitcoin ETFs trade on the major stock exchanges like NYSE, allowing broad access to retail investors and institutional investors. IBIT is a bitcoin ETF managed by BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with $11.6 trillion under management. This ETF provides direct exposure to bitcoin price movements by holding bitcoin against its shares. BlackRock has a strong reputation of successful fund management with many established relationships across the global financial world, lending credibility to its bitcoin ETF. FBTC is a bitcoin ETF managed by Fidelity, another major asset manager with $5.8 trillion under management. Like IBIT, FBTC directly holds bitcoin against its shares, ensuring close price tracking of bitcoin. Fidelity is a commonly used asset manager by retail investors while BlackRock attracts more institutional investors. Fidelity has a long track record of engagement with cryptocurrency tracing back to 2014 when the firm began researching digital assets like bitcoin and blockchain technology. Both IBIT and FBTC closely track the price of bitcoin as they hold bitcoin against shares. FBTC’s 1-year return slightly outperformed IBIT with FBTC returning 137.65% vs 137.32% but investors will likely earn comparable returns going forward. Future performance is dependent on the price movements of bitcoin and effective custody of bitcoin for both ETFs by their managers. Both IBIT and FBTC hold bitcoin against their shares and closely track the price movements of bitcoin. The core holdings of IBIT and FBTC are identical as both are entirely invested in bitcoin. Slight differences may emerge based on fund management and liquidity. Bitcoin is not an income generating asset like a bond or dividend-earning stock and neither IBIT or FBTC offer dividend yield to investors. Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC are best suited to investors who wish to gain a return from capital appreciation rather than dividend yield. Bitcoin is a speculative asset which can experience wild swings in price that retail investors may not be used to from traditional investing. For example, in February 2025, bitcoin experienced a 17% drop in value, followed by a 10% rally in March spurred on by speculation regarding a U.S. strategic cryptocurrency reserve. If the U.S. government invested in bitcoin through a strategic reserve, it would further shore up institutional adoption of the asset. The launch of bitcoin ETFs like IBIT and FBTC in 2024 increased adoption of bitcoin by allowing retail and institutional investors to more easily invest in the cryptocurrency alongside major assets like the best ETFs on exchanges. Public companies can also add bitcoin to their balance sheet as Microstrategy notably has as well as asset managers who wish to add bitcoin to their portfolio. With increased regulatory clarity by the SEC, more investors may feel comfortable investing in bitcoin, increasing its market cap and price. As mentioned, bitcoin is a volatile asset and both IBIT and FBTC can swing in price based on breaking news or market sentiment. Although regulatory clarity regarding bitcoin seems to be increasing, there is always the risk of adverse regulatory decisions affecting the price or availability of the asset in different markets. A risk which could potentially affect an ETF like IBIT or FBTC is a custody issue of bitcoin, like a hack or mismanagement of assets. As with any investment, investors should weigh their risk tolerance before investing in a bitcoin ETF like IBIT or FBTC. A good rule of thumb for bitcoin ETFs and bitcoin generally is to not invest an amount you would lose sleep over losing the entirety of. Bitcoin ETFs are subject to both short and long-term capital gains tax just like direct holding of bitcoin. One difference from a tax perspective is that bitcoin ETFs can be easily invested in through a traditional or Roth IRA, unlike direct holding of bitcoin. This can increase the tax efficiency of bitcoin investment as you may be able to defer taxes on bitcoin gains with a traditional IRA or not pay tax on these gains at all with a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax professional with cryptocurrency expertise if you’re concerned with the tax implications of investing in bitcoin ETFs. While IBIT and FBTC offer comparable bitcoin Spot ETFs, these ETFs differ based on expense ratios, asset manager strengths, and custody strategies. IBIT may be better suited for investors who wish to track the price movements of bitcoin with a lower expense ratio of 0.12%, all managed by the largest asset manager in the world with strong institutional support. FBTC may be preferred by investors who don’t mind a slightly higher expense ratio in exchange for Fidelity’s self-custody model and a decade-long track record of cryptocurrency expertise. Investors should further research both firm’s security protocols for custody as well as considering alternative bitcoin Spot ETFs and holding cryptocurrency directly as an alternative. Bottom Line IBIT and FBTC are very similar ETFs. They track the same asset and both are effective means for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin at low expense ratios from established asset managers. The ultimate decision of which ETF to choose for your portfolio comes down to reputation, minor expense ratio and performance differences, and the approach by which each firm custodies their bitcoin. Bitcoin via a Spot ETF is an exciting asset to add to one's portfolio. Rapid spikes and falls in price are an inevitability but since its inception, it has outperformed major indexes like the S&P 500. The launch of IBIT and FBTC through BlackRock and Fidelity respectively demonstrates mainstream interest and adoption by the financial services, providing the possibility for stellar returns to a greater number of investors.

Title: ‘Maximize The Value’—Trump’s Price Plan For Bitcoin, XRP, ETH, SOL And ADA Revealed

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”

Published: March 07, 2025 Yet companies keep using them over and over. In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center upended American travel, layoffs rippled through the airline industry. By late September, ~81k jobs had been cut industry-wide. Nearly everyone made cuts, from bargain carriers like Frontier and Spirit to heavyweights like American, US Airways, and United, which each laid off between 15%-23% of their workers. The lone holdout was Southwest Airlines. It delayed purchases of new planes and nixed a renovation of its corporate headquarters, but it didn’t enact layoffs. Co-founder and former CEO Herb Kelleher saw them as anathema for a successful company. “Nothing kills your company’s culture like layoffs,” Kelleher once said. If that’s true, then company culture has experienced an economy-wide massacre in recent years: Even Southwest joined the club, announcing mass layoffs for the first time in over 50 years in February. Kelleher wasn’t around to see them. He died in 2019. Herb Kelleher addresses stockholders. (David Woo/Corbis via Getty Images) Research has consistently shown he was right about layoffs: They’re damaging to companies — especially when done for cost-cutting purposes; they’re damaging to laid off employees, who’ve seen higher rates of suicide in the aftermath of layoffs; and they’re damaging to the employees who keep their jobs. So why do companies keep doing them? Once upon a time, US businesses had far more people who thought like Herb Kelleher. In the middle of the 20th century, as America entered an era of unprecedented prosperity, influential companies practiced a form of capitalism that balanced profits with employee welfare and the public good. Seasonal employees got axed at times, but mass layoffs were relatively rare, as workers routinely stayed at a single company for much of their career. Things changed starting around the 1980s. As companies sought to rebound from a nationwide economic funk, they began practicing a more rough-and-tumble capitalism that prized shareholder value and ushered in a “free agent” model of employment. Celebrity CEOs like “Neutron” Jack Welch and “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap popularized a style of management predicated on reducing costs to produce short-term profits. Clockwise from left: Chainsaw Al Dunlap, Elon Musk with chainsaw, Neutron Jack Welch. (John Pineda/Hulton Archive via Getty Images, Valerie Plesch/Washington Post via Getty Images, Thomas Lohne/DDP/AFP via Getty Images) One of their favorite tools was mass layoffs. Welch, who ran General Electric, laid off more than 100k employees during his 20-year tenure. Every fiscal year, he’d rank workers and slash the bottom 10%. Dunlap’s strategy was to cut quickly and deeply — and ask questions later. “My philosophy is to err on the side of too much,” Dunlap wrote in his memoir, Mean Business. “Too many asset sales. Too many layoffs.” Plenty of corporations followed their example: Olivia Heller/The Hustle “All of a sudden,” David Gelles, author of the Welch biography The Man Who Broke Capitalism, told NPR, “other CEOs saw that…if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that.” That ethos remains today. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 1.5m-2m Americans are typically laid off or discharged every month, a number that increases during recessions. But the belief that company earnings and stock prices increase through layoffs typically doesn’t match reality. At best, research indicates that companies that lay off employees, on average, don’t see a better financial payoff in the long term compared to companies with a stable employment base. And they often fare worse. There are findings that suggest layoffs lead to both short-term and long term issues, including: Even during bad economies, when layoffs are rampant and often more justified, the results are similar — and that’s according to Bain & Company, which, ironically, consults for firms that make cuts. After the early-2000s dotcom bust, Bain researchers found that stock prices for S&P 500 companies that had no layoffs or laid off less than 3% of their workforce increased an average of 9% in the next year. Meanwhile, stock prices were flat in companies that laid off between 3%-10% of their workers, and prices plummeted 38% for companies that laid off more than 10%. Laid off tech workers network at a “Pink Slip Party” in San Francisco after the dotcom bust in 2001. (David McNew/Newsmakers via Getty Images) Some of these issues stem from the fact that a company that does layoffs is typically in distressed shape already. But experts have found several other reasons for why layoffs lead to negative results: As they recruit, these companies often find their reputation has been damaged among potential applicants, says Wayne Cascio, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who’s researched layoffs for decades. “If they have two offers and one is with a company that just had layoffs last year and another one is with a company that hasn’t had layoffs, which one are you going to pick?” Plus, the employees who survive layoffs grow discontent with the company and burn out faster as they handle more tasks, Cascio adds, leading to expensive voluntary worker exits. Layoffs don’t always portend future problems: Companies who enact them as part of a broader change in strategy, Cascio says, fare better than those who enact them simply to cut costs. It’s also true that recent layoffs among some tech brands have been accompanied by positive reactions from investors: Some tech layoffs fit into a category that Cascio describes as proactive downsizing. The companies were relatively healthy but realized they’d hired too much during the pandemic or saw signs of struggles down the road that they believed they could avoid with restructuring. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, says Jeffrey Pfeffer, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor and expert on organizational behavior, “the tech layoffs make no sense to me.” He attributes some of them to a contagion effect that led to companies enacting layoffs simply because everyone else did it. And if overhiring or underperformance was the true problem, Pfeffer says the companies should question their leaders, who green-lit the overhiring and may have failed to develop productive roles for their employees. “You could blame the workforce,” he says, “or the managers and leaders who are leading that workforce.” Some companies clearly trust management over the workforce. After a layoffs announcement last month, Meta doubled the potential amount of bonuses its executives can receive this year. So, what are the best alternatives to layoffs? As Southwest Airlines showed in 2001, companies can reduce expenses by delaying purchases and investments, cutting in places that don’t lead to job losses. If that’s not enough, Wayne Cascio says companies should attempt to reduce hours or initiate furloughs (a temporary unpaid leave of absence) rather than layoffs. His research has shown that, even if layoffs occur, companies that try these alternatives perform better than those who instantly lay off employees when faced with financial problems. At least during the pandemic, many companies showed a willingness to delay or resist layoffs. Cascio says that a survey from the Society for Human Resources Management found that a majority of firms enacted furloughs or cut travel and employee perks before laying off workers. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, as the last few years have shown, layoffs are happening — and often without any signs that they’re indicative of larger strategic moves. The problem, Cascio says, is that there are only two ways to make money in business: growing revenues or cutting costs. Slashing costs is a far more predictable way to ensure future growth than finding new ways to generate revenue. And, too often, companies do the predictable thing. Pfeffer was reminded of this impulse on a recent flight when he got upgraded to first class and ended up next to an airline executive. The industry had used buyouts and layoffs to shrink staff sizes during the pandemic and faced difficulties in refilling positions when demand picked up. Pfeffer told the executive the layoffs had been a terrible idea. Then he asked him if his airline had gotten rid of any airplanes when business was down. The executive said it had not. “So why,” Pfeffer says, “get rid of employees?” Get the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop. Want even more business resources?

She has a Master’s in International Development from the University of Birmingham, UK. More Info United States President Donald Trump has vowed to make it easier to develop oil and gas projects in Alaska, despite concerns about environmental degradation. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to “unleash Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential”, effectively undoing former President Biden’s climate protections for the state. However, it is uncertain whether oil and gas companies will invest in a region with such strict regulations and high project development costs. In addition, many fear potential lawsuits from environmental and indigenous organisations against new developments, as well as what a change in U.S. administration could mean for projects in the future. President Trump’s order aims to expedite the permitting and leasing of energy projects in Alaska, undo resource development restrictions on state and federal lands including crucial areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), overturn the cancellation of leases within the ANWR, and prioritise the development of LNG. Alaska’s oil production decreased from around 2 million bpd in 1988 to just 426,000 bpd in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At present, just two major projects are under development, ConocoPhillips’s $8 billion Willow and Santos’ Pikka, which are expected to increase the state’s output to 650,000 bpd. Many oil and gas companies are wary of developing projects in Alaska due to the high costs involved with operations, the lack of regulatory stability, and litigation risks. Much of the state’s oil and gas reserves are within federally protected lands such as ANWR and NPR-A, which make project development risky, as a change in administration could mean more policy changes. In addition, several environmental groups have launched lawsuits against oil and gas developers in Alaska in recent years, citing environmental and climate concerns. “We’ve seen this before… where this administration breaks the law we will fight and we will enforce the environmental laws in Alaska,” the managing attorney at Earthjustice Carole Holley stated. Referring to the areas Trump is aiming to reopen for oil and gas exploration, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute Dustin Meyers stated, “Many of these areas have been closed for a good long while.” Meyers added, “There is always the risk that these areas could be reclosed after the next election cycle.” This view reflects the concerns of several oil majors. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency expects global demand for oil to slow over the next decade, while many oil and gas companies are moving to easier-to-develop areas where they can implement “low-carbon oil” operations. The Trump administration aims to attract investment for the $44 billion Alaska LNG project on Alaska’s North Slope, originally proposed by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) around a decade ago. The project was authorized by President Trump’s administration in 2020 and was reauthorized by the Biden administration in 2022. If developed, it could provide 20 million tonnes of LNG per year. “[Alaska] is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far. We’re talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and [the US] having to do with Alaska oil and gas,” Trump said at a joint press conference. However, over the last decade, several big players, including BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, have pulled out of the project. While it is unlikely that oil majors will flock to Alaska, given the plethora of challenges involved with managing oil and gas operations in the state, the threat of tariffs from the Trump administration could reinvigorate interest. On 4th March, Trump introduced 25 percent tariffs on the import of Mexican and Canadian products and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods. This has made other countries fear a similar move on their products. Trump has threatened tariffs on various countries and regions, such as the EU, if they do not increase the purchase of energy from the U.S. in the coming months. In early February, Japanese trading giant Mitsui announced it may consider investing in the Alaska LNG project, although no decisions had been made. Japan is the second-largest LNG importer globally and the government has stated that it may be open to purchasing more LNG and other energy products from the U.S., most likely in a bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on Japanese products. A few days later, Taiwan’s Economy Ministry expressed interest in purchasing more LNG from the U.S., particularly from Alaska. Taiwan’s state energy company CPC is “indeed quite interested in Alaska's natural gas and will continue to assess the feasibility and is also willing to make additional purchases,” the Ministry said in a statement. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and several EU member states have expressed interest in buying more U.S. oil and gas to reduce trade gaps that put them at risk of U.S. tariffs. However, with record highs being seen in U.S. gas production over the last year, it is not clear whether this will attract the interest and investment needed to develop new fossil fuel operations in Alaska.

Title: BlackRock And Grayscale Urged to Consider A Shiba Inu (SHIB) ETF For These Reasons
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-and-grayscale-urged-to-consider-a-shiba-inu-shib-etf-for-these-reasons/

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action. Momentum behind the initiative has been growing rapidly, with a Change.org petition directed at Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein surpassing 16,666 signatures as of press time. Meanwhile, influential SHIB group “Shibzens” have recently outlined compelling reasons why SHIB deserves ETF status, drawing parallels to the recent success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As per the group, one of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is the cryptocurrency’s massive and highly engaged community. With millions of holders actively participating in the SHIB ecosystem, it argued that the token enjoys a loyal user base that could drive demand, liquidity, and long-term price stability, key factors for a successful ETF. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, further strengthens its case. Since its launch in August 2023, the group emphasized that Shibarium has introduced real-world utility by powering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and payment solutions. The network also supports ecosystem tokens like BONE, used for gas fees, and TREAT, which could be incorporated into a diversified SHIB ETF, expanding its investment appeal. Another major factor is affordability. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be expensive for small investors, SHIB’s low price per token makes it an accessible entry point for retail traders. This inclusivity allows a broader investor base to gain crypto exposure, while SHIB’s high trading volume and strong liquidity provide a solid foundation for institutional ETF products. A SHIB ETF could also align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. The Shib Karma Foundation, a philanthropic initiative within the SHIB ecosystem, highlights the community’s commitment to social good. Additionally, SHIB’s growing adoption across industries, including gaming and payments, demonstrates its increasing real-world relevance and utility. This push comes amid significant political and institutional shifts that signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency, further strengthening the case for a SHIB ETF. Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently acknowledged major digital assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, fueling speculation that increased regulatory clarity could benefit altcoins like SHIB. On Friday, the President hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, bringing together key figures in the crypto industry. Among them was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, a well-known advocate for meme-based assets whose involvement has further bolstered optimism. The SHIB community led by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama have expressed optimism that Tenev could play a role in advocating for the inclusion of meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin in the discussions. That said, while BlackRock and Grayscale have yet to submit a formal application for a SHIB ETF, the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs proves that crypto-based investment products are viable. With strong community backing, increasing adoption, and favorable market trends, Shibizens believe SHIB is next in line.

Title: Avalanche’s daily sign-ups hit 6,000 – Identifying the reasons behind the boom

AVAX’s rapid user growth in 2025 highlights potential for a breakout. And yet, it’s largely overlooked. Avalanche [AVAX] has been quietly gaining momentum, with new user sign-ups surging in Q1 2025. While the market often fixates on Ethereum’s L2 boom and Bitcoin ETFs, Avalanche’s rapid adoption has been overlooked somewhat. In fact, history suggests that user growth often precedes major price shifts. With DeFi and GameFi activity accelerating, could Avalanche be positioning itself as the next breakout L1? Avalanche’s new user growth has seen clear fluctuations over the past two years, with periodic cycles of rapid expansion followed by cooling-off periods. In fact, the latest surge in early 2025 was one of the strongest spikes since mid-2023. It saw monthly new users exceeding 600,000 and average daily sign-ups surpassing 6,000 at its peak. This seemed to be in stark contrast to mid-to-late 2024, when user acquisition stagnated below 200,000 per month. Source: X The pattern suggested that Avalanche tends to experience bursts of adoption, likely triggered by key ecosystem developments or broader market conditions. If this trend continues, the Q1 2025 spike could signal renewed investor and developer interest, potentially setting the stage for sustained growth. Avalanche’s recent surge can be attributed to a $250 million investment in December 2024, led by Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital, aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Additionally, the Avalanche9000 upgrade, launched on 16 December, reduced transaction fees by 75% – Driving a 38% hike in daily transactions and further boosting network activity. Institutional adoption has been rising too, with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton leveraging Avalanche for tokenized funds. Despite its surge in new users, Avalanche remains largely absent from mainstream crypto discussions. Much of the market’s attention is focused on Ethereum’s L2 expansion and Bitcoin ETF inflows, leaving Avalanche’s growth relatively overlooked. Media coverage has also been skewed, with Ethereum roll-ups and Solana’s memecoin frenzy dominating headlines. Another factor contributing to its relative silence is the lack of high-profile endorsements. Unlike Solana, which benefits from outspoken backers like Visa and Jump Crypto, Avalanche is yet to secure a similarly visible champion. However, this under-the-radar momentum might create an opportunity for early adopters positioning themselves ahead of a broader market realization. Source: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock data indicated that AVAX’s price action has closely followed whale activity, with occasional spikes in large transactions aligning with price movements. This suggested that institutional and whale investors remain engaged, though sustained accumulation might be uncertain. Source: IntoTheBlock Finally, there is a correlation between active addresses in profit and AVAX’s price cycles. Historically, sharp increases in profitable addresses have often preceded local price tops, while periods of underwater holders have set the stage for recoveries. If these patterns hold, AVAX could see further upside in 2025, provided demand remains strong and broader market conditions are favorable.
