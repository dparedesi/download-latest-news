According to statements made on CNBC, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has topped $100 billion in assets under management less than two years after it launched. That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand. BlackRock’s move signals a larger reality: digital assets are now part of mainstream finance. Fink’s change in tone — from caution to active investment — reflects that shift. The presence of a major manager with hundreds of thousands of BTC and a growing set of tokenized offerings will influence how investors view crypto exposure.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 billion deal highlights the unstoppable AI data center gold rush, as CEO Larry Fink pushes back on AI bubble fears

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Today’s announcement that a group of investors led by BlackRock has agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal underscores the seemingly unstoppable flow of money into AI data centers—and comes as its CEO, Larry Fink, pushes back on AI bubble fears. The deal to buy Aligned, which is owned by Macquarie Asset Management, is being inked by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP)—a coalition formed in September 2024 by BlackRock, its infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as Microsoft, Nvidia, and MGX, an AI investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI, and Temasek joined as additional participants. The AIP was formed to invest up to $30 billion of equity capital in AI, data centers, and energy; this is its first deal, which ranks as one of BlackRock’s largest infrastructure investments to date. If completed, it would be among the largest data center transactions on record, and regardless it underscores how Wall Street is racing to claim a stake in the AI boom. Fink has rejected the idea that AI infrastructure spending represents a dangerous bubble, arguing that massive data center build-outs are essential if the U.S. is to remain the global leader. “Well, there’s a bubble in investing,” he said on CNBC Squawk Box yesterday. “But are we inferring a bubble means a bad thing? There is certainly a skyrocketing amount of capital being put to work. If you put it in a framework of geopolitical positioning, we as a country need these investments if we’re going to be the leader in AI technology.” Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Plano, Texas, was founded in 2013 to build and operate data centers for hyperscalers and cloud-computing companies. It has data centers across the U.S.—including in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City—as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile. The timing of the deal comes as Big Tech firms race to secure scarce land, power, and compute capacity—the foundational resources underpinning the AI race. For example, over the past few weeks, OpenAI has announced multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD in order to lock in the computing power the company needs. “We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” Altman told reporters during a media event at OpenAI and Oracle’s flagship 800-acre Stargate data center location in Abilene, Texas, last month, where he also announced the companies will build five massive new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. OpenAI is far from alone: Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals in the past two months with U.K.-based data center developer Nscale, including the announcement today of a new site in Texas that will have capacity of as much as 240 megawatts of power. Also today, Meta announced it would invest $1.5 billion in an AI data center in El Paso, Texas, that could scale to 1 gigawatt, making it one of the largest planned data center campuses in the U.S. The total numbers are staggering: On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. And McKinsey said U.S. data center demand, driven largely by AI, could triple by 2030, and require data centers to make nearly $7 trillion in investments to keep up. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset. The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%. VolShares filed for 5x single stock and crypto ETFs incl COIN, CRCL, GOOG, MSTR, NVDA, PLTR, TSLA, Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP... They haven't even approved 3x and VolShares is like let's try 5x.

The funds were launched by prestigious asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, and had the most successful launch in the history of ETFs, with Ethereum funds following in summer last year. Asset managers are now trying to get ETFs approved that give exposure to altcoins, including top assets like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin—though a couple have already started trading.

A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% in morning trading. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: The Protocol: Monad Airdrop Portal Opens as Token Launch Nears

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: MONAD AIRDROP COMES CLOSER AS PORTAL OPENS: Monad is gearing up for one of the most anticipated token launches of the year. The Layer-1 blockchain project has opened its MON airdrop portal, inviting eligible users to check their status ahead of the official token distribution. While the airdrop itself hasn’t gone live yet, the Monad Foundation said that users can now verify eligibility and connect their wallets, with the window remaining open until Nov. 3, 2025. “There is NO incentive to claiming really fast, so take your time. Triple check everything,” said Keone Hon, the co-founder of Monad, on X. The Monad Foundation shared in a blog post that it will target around 5,500 core community members and 225,000 broader crypto users, rewarding those who’ve helped grow the Monad ecosystem. Distribution will be done through a multi-track system spanning five categories: Monad Community, Onchain Users, Crypto Community, Crypto Contributors & Curious and Monad Builders. Those who qualify across multiple tracks can stack their allocations, giving more weight to active participants. The team also said it will be combining on-chain activity data (such as DEX volume and NFT ownership) with off-chain verification through platforms like Twitter, Discord and Telegram. The airdrop marks a step toward Monad’s upcoming mainnet launch, though the details of when that will happen and the number of tokens allocated towards these communities are still unknown. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. FUSAKA GOES LIVE ON ETHEREUM’S SEPOLIA TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched the second test of the upcoming Fusaka upgrade earlier this week on the Sepolia network, marking another step toward the upgrade’s mainnet debut. The test follows a successful rollout on the Holesky testnet two weeks ago. Developers plan one final rehearsal on the Hoodi network on Oct. 28, after which they’ll set a date to activate Fusaka on Ethereum’s main blockchain. Coming only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade, Fusaka is designed to lower costs for institutions using the network. One of its key features, PeerDAS, allows validators to verify only portions of data rather than entire “blobs.” This improvement reduces bandwidth demands and helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Testnets like Sepolia play a crucial role in Ethereum’s development cycle, giving developers a reliable environment to test upgrades under real-world conditions before they go live on the main network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. MONERO RELEASES PRIVACY BOOST AGAINST SNEAKY NETWORK NODES: Leading privacy blockchain Monero has released an important upgrade that significantly strengthens user protection against spy nodes. The blockchain announced CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' on X, calling it a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes. Monero relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network where nodes (computers) connect directly to each other to share and verify transactions and blocks. Privacy is ensured through several key technologies: each transaction uses unique stealth addresses so that the recipient’s actual address stays hidden; ring signatures mix a sender’s transaction with other decoy transactions, making it unclear who really sent the funds; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide the amount being transferred. Still, a paper published on the research sharing platform arXiv in September noted the growing presence of non-standard nodes in the network. These nodes pose as honest nodes but are likely intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes, thereby endangering privacy. The Fluorine Fermi update tackles this challenge by implementing an improved peer selection algorithm that reduces the chance users connect to multiple nodes within the same IP subnet, a common spy node tactic. It discourages connections to large clusters of suspicious IP addresses, steering users toward safer nodes. — Omkar Godbole Read more. EF MAKES PRIVACY A PILLAR OF ITS WORK: The Ethereum Foundation is making privacy a formal pillar of its roadmap, expanding research efforts into a dedicated cluster that now covers private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases. Ethereum has supported privacy research through its Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team since 2018, with experiments like Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail and zkTLS, and the Anon Aadhaar project. These have become reference points for developers across the ecosystem, spawning hundreds of forks and integrations. The new “privacy cluster,” coordinated by Igor Barinov, brings these experiments under a single umbrella alongside new initiatives, per a blog post. Those include private reads and writes for payments and interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID systems for selective disclosure, UX work to normalize privacy tools, and Kohaku, an SDK and wallet designed to make strong cryptography usable by default. An Institutional Privacy Task Force is also part of the cluster, translating compliance and operational requirements into specifications that larger enterprises can test. The Foundation framed privacy as essential to Ethereum’s credibility. Blockchains are transparent by design, but widespread adoption requires that users and institutions have the option to transact, govern, and build without exposing sensitive data. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

"Five years from now, there's not going to be a stock, there's not going to be an option, there's not going to be a mutual fund, ETF, anything that's not in effect tokenized," Moglia told CNBC on Tuesday, describing traditional finance professionals as still struggling to grasp the shift happening in Web3 and DeFi markets. “Going forward, real-world assets are going to be tokenized as the rest of the world is going to be,” he added, while adding he’s pursuing tokenization of its reinsurance company's risk as part of its strategy. His comments come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appeared on 60 Minutes advocating crypto ownership after previously dismissing Bitcoin in 2017 as an "index of money laundering,” a shift Moglia attributes to Fink becoming "a DeFi guy" who "appreciates the future." BlackRock is developing proprietary tokenization technology and "having conversations with all the major platforms" about digital wallet integration, according to Fink's recent earnings call. "We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries," Fink said, pointing to real estate, where tokenization could reduce fees and make home ownership more affordable by cutting out layers of middlemen. Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt that tokenization will now "work its way up that risk curve" toward less liquid assets. "I truly believe ultimately we will have almost every financial asset in a tokenized version because it just helps to automate the value chain, starting from issuance over the primary market, secondary market, the legal anchor, corporate actions, all of this. Musheer Ahmed, Founder & MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt, "while there is significant momentum for tokenization of financial products and I am also bullish on the use case, this timeline of 5 years to tokenize everything is highly optimistic." Ahmed noted that the timeline is plausible even as “most trading rails and infra will take many years” and that “the tokenization wave is led by the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE,” while most markets still “lack frameworks for digital assets.” The low trading volume in tokenized assets stems from “the nature of the underlying assets,” he said, noting “most RWAs are not liquid or in high demand for daily turnover.” “Current tokenized products (outside of bonds) are not being actively marketed by brokers, private banks, or investment funds,” he said, and that once they are offered more widely, “demand will pick up and help create a more dynamic secondary market.” Total real-world assets on-chain have reached $33.91 billion, up 6.6% from 30 days ago, with 483,892 total asset holders, according to RWA.xyz data.

Apple has topped Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands ranking for the 13th consecutive year—but AI giant Nvidia is closing in on its crown. Interbrand’s list ranks 100 companies based on their financial performance, the role their brand plays in purchase intent, and the brand’s competitive strength. The total value of this year’s Best Global Brands stands at $3.6 trillion, a 4.4% increase versus last year. 2025’s top five brands remained unchanged from 2024, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Samsung following Apple’s lead. However, further down the list, there’s been a historic surge for Nvidia and 12 new entrants across tech, finance, retail, and more, underlining shifting market dynamics. AI chipmaker Nvidia recorded the largest-ever brand value increase in Best Global Brands’ history, rising by 116% to reach $43.2bn—catapulting it from 36th place in 2024 to 15th in 2025. “Nvidia’s stellar product marketing and complete dominance in its ecosystem have spurred its meteoric rise,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand. However, he cautioned that the Silicon Valley company (which was founded in 1993, but has recently surged in prominence as its hardware drives the AI boom) shouldn’t get too comfortable. “The emergence of a disruptor could undo this brand if it does not invest in long-term brand storytelling,” Silverman said. “It has the scale, but that’s not a brand strategy. To maintain sustainable growth, this is imperative.” Despite their recent advertising blitzes, consumer-facing AI brands like OpenAI and Anthropic did not make this year’s list. Notable new entries included investment firm BlackRock, which landed at number 31, Booking.com (32), and Uniqlo (47). Instagram’s brand value grew 27%, leading it too enter the top 10 for the first time, too. When it came to brand tumbles, Nike—which is transforming to regain its marketing edge—dropped from the 14th to the 23rd spot after losing 26% of its value. Elon Musk’s Tesla also dropped 13 spots to 25th place, with a 35% decline in brand value. Interbrand’s Best Global Brands 2025 – Top 10 1. Apple 2. Microsoft 3. Amazon 4. Google 5. Samsung 6.

Crypto exchange Backpack said it is adding SEC-registered U.S. equities to its trading platform with Superstate, the blockchain finance startup led by Compound founder Robert Leshner. Announced on Wednesday, the deal embeds Superstate’s Opening Bell platform into Backpack, allowing non-U.S. users to trade tokenized shares of public companies onchain. With the addition, Backpack claimed the bragging rights of being the first centralized crypto exchange to list issuer-backed, SEC-registered equities natively onchain. Supported equities and rollout date will be announced in the coming weeks, the firms said. These offerings are not synthetic or wrapped derivative products, the firms said, but real equities issued under U.S. securities law with the same CUSIP identifiers as their traditional counterparts on Nasdaq or the NYSE. "For traders, that means more assets to buy, sell and use as collateral — with better margin opportunities than traditional markets," Robert Leshner said in a statement. "For issuers, it expands reach to millions of crypto-native investors, connecting them directly with modern capital markets infrastructure." The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments, such as equity shares, bonds, and funds, is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A wide range of tokenized equity offerings debuted over the past few months, including Robinhood, Gemini, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance, creating token versions of the largest publicly-traded companies and ETFs. Superstate's Opening Bell focuses on creating tokenized versions of publicly traded stocks by working through a registered transfer agent. The platform brings the structure of U.S. capital markets onto blockchain rails, offering direct ownership and future access to DeFi tools. Backpack was founded by crypto developer Armani Ferrante and is best known for its role in the Solana ecosystem and having acquired imploded crypto exchange FTX's European arm. It has since grown into a broader financial platform. It launched a centralized exchange in 2023 with a virtual asset service provider license in Dubai, while it opened last month its EU-focused derivatives venue based in Cyprus and regulated under the MiFID II framework.

Bitcoin BTC$108,827.68 mining firm Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR) jumped as much as 30% on Wednesday after announcing new steps to fast-track its expansion into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The Singapore-based company said it will directly manage development of its own AI data centers rather than rely on outside partners, starting with its facility in Clarington, Ohio. Bitdeer said the local utility confirmed that all 570 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity will be available by the end of the third quarter of 2026, nearly a year ahead of schedule. Two other sites — Tydal in Norway and Wenatchee, Washington in the U.S. — will also be converted, with Tydal expected to support 164 MW of AI computing by late next year, the firm said. The company said it sees a "sustained imbalance" between demand and supply of AI computing power. The firm expects to deploy over 200 MW for AI computing by the end of next year. In an optimistic scenario, Bitdeer said its AI operations could generate more than $2 billion in annualized revenue. "This push is driven by a marked increase in inbound interest in our power assets, which has become a strong catalyst for expanding our efforts," Matt Kong, chief business officer at Bitdeer, said in a statement. The company's shares rose as much as 30% in the early minutes in the Wednesday session, trading above $26 for the first time since early January. They were 26% higher at press time. Bitdeer's development fits into a broader trend of crypto mining firms pivoting to repurpose their computing power for the fast-growing AI demand.

Who knew they could all work together? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Asset management firm BlackRock has joined forces with Microsoft, Nvidia, and xAI to purchase Aligned Data Centers (Aligned) through an investment consortium called the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP). Aligned is one of the largest data center companies in the world, having a total of planned and operational capacity of 5GW spread across 50 campuses. According to the company, the data center operator is present globally, including sites in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Sao Paulo (Brazil), Queretaro (Mexico), and Santiago (Chile). Aside from AIP, other partners in the deal also included MGX, an AI investment firm owned and funded by the Abu Dhabi government in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the Kuwait Investment Authority, and Temasek, a state-owned investment company owned by the Singapore Minister for Finance. These investments show how state-owned funds are interested in diving into artificial intelligence, either through their own infrastructure, like the Stargate AI project in the UAE, or through monetary contributions to projects like these. Other companies, like Cisco Systems, GE Vernova, and Next Era Energy, are also part of the partnership as technology and power providers. But what’s more interesting is how some of the biggest names in AI joined together to form AIP. BlackRock, GIP, Microsoft, and MGX founded the partnership in September 2024, with Nvidia and xAI joining later. Even though it took more than a year for the group to make its first purchase, it’s a massive one — the deal is expected to cost $40 billion, making it one of the most expensive data center purchases in history. This combination of capital and technical expertise would help Aligned stay ahead in the global AI race. “Partnering with the Consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy,” Aligned Data Centers CEO Andrew Schaap said. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure.” AIP expects to complete the deal by the first half of 2026, provided it passes regulatory oversight.

Title: When it comes to private credit on Wall Street, one firm's win is another's fear

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hello there! If you're looking to get more intimate with ChatGPT, you're in luck. Sam Altman said OpenAI's chatbot will allow "erotica for verified adults." In today's big story, BlackRock's Larry Fink said he's never been more excited about the future. JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon is warning about a potential infestation of cockroaches. Welcome to the ongoing debate over private credit. What's on deck: Markets: Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI about the similarities he sees between 1929 and the current stock market. Tech: We've got the list of people who report directly to Nvidia's Jensen Huang. Business: The biggest trend working against Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's future marriage. But first, giving credit where it's due If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Two Wall Street titans. Two very different moods. In one corner, there's BlackRock and Larry Fink. The billionaire CEO was "giddy" on Tuesday's earnings call, per BI's Bradley Saacks, when describing the success of the firm's private markets business. That includes the red-hot private-credit sector, where investors lend directly to borrowers. Despite representing just a fraction of the $13.5 trillion firm's total assets, BlackRock's private markets business has been booming. The fees from the business unit are up 136% this year compared to the same time period last year. "I've never been more excited about the future of BlackRock," said Fink on the call. In the other corner, you have JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, who didn't mince words when talking about the recent auto industry bankruptcies that have reignited questions about the risks of non-bank lending. "When you see one cockroach, there's probably more," said Dimon on the bank's earnings call regarding the potential for more high-profile blowups. Fink and Dimon's thoughts illustrate the boom-or-bust argument that has accompanied the rise of private credit, or non-bank lending. And with Blackstone and Apollo, both big players in the space, reporting earnings in the coming weeks, the dialogue won't be ending anytime soon. Being able to borrow from someone besides the big banks has been a welcome change for some. And the investors willing to fill the void — and take the risk — have often been rewarded handsomely. But others, most notably Dimon, have continued to sound the alarm about the risks associated with the rise of lenders not held to the same tight standards as banks. The private-credit debate isn't as simple as pitting banks against non-bank lenders. There's a lot more nuance, including the fact that many large banks have launched their own private-credit arms. (JPMorgan set aside an additional $50 billion for private credit earlier this year.) "People are very focused on how banks and non-banks are going to go head-to-head and compete with each other in the space. The reality is, the real game will be the ones who figure out how to partner with each other," Troy Rohrbaugh, the co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, told me this January in Davos. One industry both sides will likely continue to pursue is artificial intelligence. Private credit's benefits — speed, creative financing, easy access — are exactly what tech companies are looking for as they spend big to build out their infrastructure empires. But another benefit of private credit — the lack of public disclosures compared to traditional loans — also represents one of its greatest risks. That secrecy benefits borrowers, but further complicates the already convoluted ways companies are financing their AI push. 1. Andrew Ross Sorkin has seen this stock-market play before … sort of. The CNBC host swears the timing of "1929", his new book that covers the infamous stock market crash, is a mere coincidence. Still, Sorkin told BI's William Edwards that he's concerned that some of those same elements are playing out in today's AI stock market frenzy. 2. A silver lining for another precious metal. Silver smashed a new record, hitting $53.55 in London. Investors have been flocking to precious metals as safe havens, but a short squeeze fueled its surge as silver has faced growing concerns over its inventory in London. 3. Goldman Sachs revamps its OneGS program, but there's a price to pay. The AI-driven overhaul, newly dubbed "OneGS 3.0" will "re-wire" the bank's operations and leverage AI to accelerate its efficiency goals. That comes with a headcount restraint and a "limited reduction" of some roles, though. Read the memo Goldman sent to staff. 1. A glimpse into Jensen Huang's inner circle. The Nvidia CEO has 36 direct reports as of this month, according to an internal list obtained by BI. Huang is known for having more direct reports than his peers to help with information flow. Last year, he said he had 55. Here's the list. 2. Spotify is adding parental controls. The new settings will block videos, podcasts, and explicit content for Family Accounts where parents can monitor what kids consume. It's about time, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 3. This AI bubble isn't feeling very bubbly. Some tech leaders and Wall Street execs keep saying we're in an AI bubble. But unless you're in a very specific industry or part of the world, it probably doesn't feel like it. That's because this bubble is not like the others, writes BI's Peter Kafka. 1. Plight of the trophy husband. Couples are more likely to divorce when the woman earns more than the man, a 2023 study found. A majority of the breadwinning women who spoke to BI said money negatively affected their relationships — but some have figured out how to make it work. 2. Former Miss USA says she feels "vindicated" after Miss Universe lawsuit. Noelia Voigt became the first Miss USA to resign after what her mother called "eight months of abuse and torture" by ex-CEO Laylah Rose. For Voigt, Miss Universe's lawsuit against Rose is a step in the right direction, though she said it covers only a "small percentage" of what she went through. 3. Disney's DEI approach that doesn't say DEI. The Mouse House kicks off its first-ever "Global Belonging Week" for employees, from October 20 to 24, according to an email viewed by BI. The event's itinerary notably includes less politically charged words like "belonging" instead of "diversity" and "equity." One workplace expert said the word choice is a sign of the times.

WSB Now A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Title: Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY CALLER Audrey StrebDCNF Energy Reporter Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda. In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.” “BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’) Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration. Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups. Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion. BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story. Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital. Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.” Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024. “Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.” Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.” “Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar. “What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said. (RELATED: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office) University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance Greg Brown told the AP that the reason behind these buyouts are “very simple. Because there’s a lot of money to be made.” Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases. “There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.” ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition. “BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.” Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.” Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May. The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

It was deliberate policy by the greens in Democratic administrations, who were also ignoring the reliability effects of doing so. BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America Quite literally, a power grab. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, met with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves at Downing Street. With $10 trillion under management, BlackRock is more than a financial institution—it’s a shadow government shaping economies and societies across the globe. … The message was clear: BlackRock is not just an investment firm; it’s a stakeholder in the UK’s political and economic future. https://labourheartlands.com/blackrocks-britain-how-corporate-giants-are-rewriting-the-social-contract/ BlackRock and Blackstone: Not building better worlds. And Larry Fink should not be allowed to take any stakes in any UK utility without leaving the USA, answering questions to the UK public, not their corrupted representatives. He is not a shadow government, he is a mafioso. He only cares about making money and his modus operandum is to make the majority pay far, far more. You can, sadly, count on Kier & Co to sell us all down the swannee… Kier Starmer decided a legal opinion was somehow binding (self-loathing, guilt etc) and is giving the Chagos islands – Diego Garcia and all – to Malaysia, a firm ally of Beijing; and it will cost us at least £30 odd billion for the privilege, but it does get worse – with Labour in charge it always does. UK and US security sources have confirmed to Guido local media reports and social media speculation that Mauritius has signed an agreement with India to allow New Delhi to set up a ‘satellite tracking station’ near Chagos. The facility will be on Mauritius territory – which now means the Chagos Islands – near the base area on Diego Garcia… Indian outlet The Economic Times describes the new base as a “strategic asset for monitoring the region”. It reported: “India and Mauritius also signed an agreement on hydrography to conduct joint surveys, prepare navigation charts and share hydrographic data of the Mauritius EEZ. Modi said India remained committed to enhancing maritime security and capacity of Mauritius.” – Guido Fawkes You completely miss the point. Larry Fink is not interested in money, but total power and control and pushing a transformative global Agenda with the aim to end national sovereignties . And for this he is willing to sacrifice billions, as many corporations already did by going woke. Blackrock is at the very center of green energy transition. Blackrock is also major stakeholder of the MIC companies (Raytheon etc). (now guess who is behind all those endless wars). And Larry Fink openly stated”We will force behavior ” Behavior is what you eat( the war on meat production), who you are allowed to criticize, that you must worship LGBT , love open borders(Fink is a huge fan of that) mandatory vaccination etc. It’s not only Keir Starmer and UK. ” Germanies” chancellor Merz is a Blackrock employee. And before Starmer , Sunak was a Goldman Sachs, Johnson had the same Goldman Sachs mentor, and Merkels bos…advisor was a Goldman Sachs. Blackrock is nothing more than the East India Company of the 21st century(even in a literal sense, while Vanguard is its branch of oligarchs that they established). Avi Yemeni asked the Blackrock CEO at Davos after a meeting with top politicians what he talked about with his employees rulers? Larry Fink did not answer. I wonder why? China has spent decades on its belt and road, worldwide. And now certain favours are being called in. The collapse of the spy trial is literally the tip of the iceberg. They don’t want to talk about that secret basement in the proposed Chinese Embassy. Only China would redact the architectural drawings. “Blackstone” and “BlackRock” are just different names for coal. When you electrify everything the oppoorunities for the utility to make money boggle the mind. Hmm. An asset manager taking over utility companies and doing things that raise prices while claiming that customers are better off for user hardships and asset manager profits. Seems unlikely. Green is the perfect scam. We need an independent source enabled to compete. (Enabling to compete has to be intentional/governmental, because the one you would compete against already has the advantage of intentional government enabling.) Or at least remove green’s rigged advantages? How is this different from what the current owners are doing? ‘Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda.’ Large utility holding companies have been gobbling up local utilities for decades. Even if they don’t own generating assets, they promote renewables due to the need to increase the amount of transmission assets they have in rate base. Frank, As you likely know there were problems with utility holding companies in the 1920s. Adding luxury assets to utility rate base was one abuse of their government granted monopoly that was finally reined-in with the “used and useful” doctrine. I think this doctrine can be employed again. How would it be possible that generating sources with an inherent capacity factor (a capital utility or utilization factor) of 25% or less would not trigger an adverse “used and useful” finding that would limit what could be added to the rate base? I pointed this out in a summary I put together after Wyoming Senate fact-finding hearing in February 2024, but I’m not sure that anyone quite followed my reasoning. At least no one responded to it. The biggest problem is that public service commissions lack sufficient engineering help, and are also, generally, pretty ignorant of the history of electric utilities. They are also afraid of becoming entangled in court with big entities like Blackrock. By the way, I think Warren Buffet is well aware of how this could go — abuse the rate payers sufficiently and your utility ends up being owned by the State; an outcome that no one should cheer. ‘How would it be possible that generating sources with an inherent capacity factor (a capital utility or utilization factor) of 25% or less would not trigger an adverse “used and useful” finding that would limit what could be added to the rate base?’ Excellent point / question, Kevin! If I recall, prior to U&U, ‘gold plating’ of utility rate base, particularly generation, not only ensured higher earnings, but also minimized the number of pesky calls utility executives received from the control room in the middle of the night (or while playing golf). This, of course, also had the adverse effect that these surplus assets need not be run particularly efficiently. What’s apparent today is that many of the utilities here in the North East, that have long since undergone ‘deregulation’ (divested themselves of their generation assets), are now in cahoots with their blue state regulators (i.e., energy Marxists) to encourage the buildout of renewables as a means of stuffing more transmission and demand-side management (DSM) assets into rate base. That is exactly what National Grid has been doing in the UK, passing themselves off as a “neutral” party. Now with the split, NESO hold the planning remit. All the solutions they go for are for more grid, because it’s the same people. I am now pushing a narrative about stranded grid and renewables assets as a counterweight. Not sure how far I’ll get, but I do have some important ears listening to me. I am in the throes of putting together some analysis on the plans for extensive grid investment in the UK. Offshore wind has perhaps slightly better capacity factors as potential, but by the time you start looking at likely curtailment as capacity grows those rates fall dramatically. The result is heavy underutilisation of grid assets, pushing up bills. I looked at wind curtailment in 2024 which peaked at 7GW. I found you would struggle to justify much more than 1GW of extra transmission to try to handle it, even assuming you could find a market for the output. With low values when output gets curtailed the economics get even harder. Energy companies providing public utilities are regulated heavily by the State bureaucracy. They are guaranteed a profit no matter how poorly they mis-manage their plant and resources. They can pass almost all costs on to their customers. They are overseen in the end by politicians whose main goal is getting and keeping power and money. If the electorate is not “woke”, meaning aware and living in reality, God help us as they will take us down the path of ruin and energy shortages. Wind and solar energy have negative value on open markets. It cannot be dispatched to meet demand. Utilities only pay for it if they are mandated too. On that level I can’t see where renewables and making profit are connected. I am not seeing where owning the utility is the place to be if you want to promote them. If they only take power from wind/solar on a PPA, then all the utility can do is pass the purchase price on to the customer. If they can own the wind/solar plant, however, they can not only charge for O&M, taxes, and depreciation, but add the value of the plant to their rate base and earn 7.5% easily — in fact earn maybe 10% on their own contributed capital if they borrow say 50% at 5% interest. Building wind/solar is much faster than building thermal plants, thus bulks up rate base more quickly. I see this as an opportunity, none of these deals can move forward without regulatory approval. All future projects must provide a 24/7 power supply less down time for maintenance and updates. No project will be approved that depends on government money to stay afloat. No source of generation will have preference over another to the grid. No source will be paid for not generating power. No source will be guaranteed a certain rate. All sources must have end of service plans and money. I’m sure there should be other requirements but these are enough to insure a bright future for clean, reliable, safe and affordable fossil fuel and nuclear power. Subsidy mining is where it’s at as the climate changers are stuck between the Blackrocks and a hard place- ‘Money train continues’: Absurd number of subsidies to make sustainable energy viable When the lights begin to flicker they know there’ll be more slushfunding to kiss it better. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Today’s top news: 🧭 Larry Fink on Crypto: ETFs now, tokenization next BlackRock’s Larry Fink had a lot to say about crypto yesterday. And the primary takeaway - we’re just getting started. On CNBC yesterday, Larry Fink praised how spot Bitcoin ETFs opened the door for mainstream investors. Then he got specific on how tokenization is the future. The world he envisions includes mutual funds, private credit, money markets, even real-world assets issued as tokens, settling near-instantly, with compliance baked into the token (who can hold it, where it can move, when it can trade). He said BlackRock is building the tech to drop these products directly into digital wallets, cut settlement frictions, slash transfer/record-keeping costs, and give clients 24/7 portability. He also stressed that Bitcoin still has a role, but sized responsibly. “We’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equity to bonds, across the board.” — Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, on CNBC CEO of world’s largest asset manager… “We're just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets.” Yes, includes ETFs. Larry Fink on his positively evolving attitude towards crypto: “I grow & learn.” Good lesson here. And some of you *still* think crypto is a scam. pic.twitter.com/GJ8oxWF3vK — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 15, 2025 ETFs are the on-ramp today; the bigger story is tokenizing pretty much everything tomorrow. This is the playbook from the world’s biggest asset manager: Overall, this means more people gaining access to these investment products, which is a win. And they’ll be able to trade more efficiently via blockchain with lower fees - win win. But it might not be a complete win. Ethereum was largely expected to be the home of RWA tokenization. If that happens on BlackRock’s own rails (and other banks / institutions follow suit), that does hurt one aspect of the Ethereum bull case. But there also may be a world where bringing that amount of assets and asset types onchain is more net bullish overall than it is bearish to the Ethereum tokenization bull case.

Business The S&P Global logo is seen in this illustration taken on January 29, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration S&P Global has agreed to buy private markets data provider With Intelligence, the company said on Wednesday, as it looks to expand its products for the fast-growing segment of financial services. Private markets are seeing increased investor interest as years of higher interest rates and muted exits have pressured private valuations at a time when industry executives are concerned about asset price bubbles in public markets. Insights into pricing and comparables for private assets have become valuable because of the historical opacity around such investments. The trend has drawn BlackRock, with the world's largest asset manager spending $12.5 billion to buy Global Infrastructure Partners last year.

Title: Hightower Launches New Branded RIA Channel
URL: https://www.wealthmanagement.com/ria-news/hightower-launches-ria-channel-called-hightower-signature-wealth
Time Published: 2025-10-15T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
The move is one of new CEO Larry Restieri’s first steps toward creating “Hightower 3.0,” which includes a branded RIA that will house both partnered and acquired firms. October 15, 2025 Hightower has launched a new registered investment advisor division called Hightower Signature Wealth as the firm’s new CEO seeks to compete more directly in the branded, large RIA space. Hightower Signature Wealth is seeded by Dallas-based Frontier Investment Management, a Hightower partner firm. CEO Larry Restieri said the division has more internal advisors in the pipeline for the first quarter and acquisition targets likely to join soon. “We saw an opportunity to more or less create a firm within a firm,” said Restieri, who joined Hightower in June from Goldman Sachs. “Hightower Signature Wealth is going to be a fully centralized, full-stack firm with centralized onboarding and centralized portfolio management. ... It will make us a better operator for every firm, because now we will own the whole client journey.” The creation of Hightower Signature Wealth signals the next stage of development for one of the sector’s first and largest RIA aggregators, which has grown to $326 billion in assets under management across more than 100 partner firms. Hightower and Focus Financial Partners were among the first RIA partnership aggregators drawing wirehouse advisors to a more independent, fiduciary-driven model. Unlike Focus, Hightower did not turn to the public markets and instead shifted to leveraging private equity capital to grow through acquisition under former CEO Bob Oros. Related:Choreo's Roger Ochs Steps Down as President of the $27B RIA Oros’ tenure led to Hightower going from $57 billion in client assets to $1.8 trillion when including assets under advisement. Restieri called that second period for Hightower “horizontal growth,” and said the firm is now turning to a more centralized, scaled structure he calls “Hightower 3.0.” “By adding a lot of firms, you add layers of complexity,” he said. “This next phase, really, is about [asking] how do we get scale in the business? How do we think about really professionalizing some of the middle and back office? ... How do we really operate the business more as one collective as opposed to lots of businesses?” While Restieri sees Hightower Signature as just one option within Hightower’s partnered network, he expects it to be a major one, representing 20% to 25% of the RIA’s assets “in a relatively short period of time.” The new channel will give advisors access to an investment platform headed by Stephanie Link, the firm’s chief investment strategist, portfolio manager and a long-time CNBC contributor. They will also get support from Randy Bullard, who Hightower recently hired from State Street to oversee a centralized investment management platform backed by institutional research and investment counsel from NEPC. Related:$6B RIA Alesco Advisors Acquired By Local Credit Union Hightower partner firms that join Signature Wealth will also have the chance for a cash payment and firm equity as part of the transition. Brandon Kawal, partner at Advisor Growth Strategies, said Hightower’s move is a further sign of the evolution of RIA partnership models. He noted that the more central RIA structure could address several different advisor stumbling blocks, including succession needs, fostering organic growth, and having a platform to acquire smaller teams. “This model is more well-suited for [Hightower] to build a more central, integrated RIA platform,” Kawal said. “You have more influence over the organic growth story because you can do all of the marketing, digital, print, events, all around one central structure versus adapting to 100 different firms; that will also be a new way to build value for Hightower shareholders.” Kawal said Hightower has thus far been able to buy and invest in partnered firms on the pitch of providing central resources to support them. Still, except for the most powerful individual brands, many partners may be losing ground in that structure. Related:Captrust Acquires $3.1B Upstate New York RIA “Now [Hightower] can offer firms the power of one brand and one growth machine without disrupting what they have spent years building,” he said. “That is the thing that Creative and Mercer and others can provide—they have a single brand growth machine.” Restieri emphasized that Hightower will remain a firm for the independent advisors by which it built its scale, and it is not seeking to move all of its business into the Signature Wealth channel. In September, the firm announced the hire of Patrick Dunne from BlackRock to head operations and service. According to Restieri, this includes creating a regional support network for partner firms to help them collaborate. Meanwhile, he wants the Hightower brand to be more central and showcase the talent he sees across the firm. “We have a great brand with advisors, but we’re not really that well-known a brand among clients,” he said. “Now we can create this brand; we can invest in the brand.” According to the CEO, Hightower Signature Wealth will also “widen the aperture” on deals and position Hightower to better compete with the models of RIAs such as Creative Planning, Mercer Advisors and Wealth Enhancement. “A lot of the acquisitions that have been happening in the space have been to firms that have more of a conforming model,” he said. “ If you’re an advisor joining those firms, you adopt the home team brand, and as of now, we haven’t really played in that space as aggressively. Now we can actually be in that space, and I feel like it just gives us so much more optionality.” Hightower was founded in 2007 by Elliot Weissbluth as a wirehouse breakaway firm with a partnership model. In 2018, private equity firm Thomas H. Lee P took a stake in Hightower. Soon after, Oros came on to lead an acquisition spree that included over 50 deals, with one of his final plays being to take a majority stake in NEPC, a large institutional consulting firm and outsourced chief investment officer. Frontier Investment, in which Hightower took an ownership stake in 2020, is one of its fastest-growing partners with a strong custodial referral network. The firm will join the new channel in a partnered, Schedule K-1 tax structure, by which it reports earnings and losses to the IRS. However, Restieri said that future firms will join as W-2 employee advisors. “When we joined Hightower, we wanted a partner who could fuel our growth while honoring who we are,” Brian Hattendorf, managing partner of Frontier, said in a statement. “Signature Wealth is a natural next step, amplifying our reach and delivering a more integrated client experience.” Focus Financial is also going through a process of centralizing its network of advisors. In 2024, it announced it was consolidating its 90 independent subsidiaries into a handful of “hub” firms, and in 2025 said it would be bringing those firms under the Focus brand umbrella. RIA consultant Kawal said Hightower’s model may take time to grow, but it will also allow the RIA to bring on smaller firms that wouldn’t have worked through the partnership model. “You still needed a way to make acquisitions that needed more brand, marketing, and infrastructure offering, because otherwise it’s going to be really hard to go do a deal with a really great $500 million RIA,” he said. CEO Restieri, who officially started the top job in June, has traveled extensively in the past year to meet with advisors and learn the business. He said there has been a shift in advisor sentiment from wanting to be “independent at every step” to being agnostic about where the middle- and back-office work comes from, as long as it’s the best solution. “What they care about is what I would call the ‘last mile to the client,’” he said. “Some firms want to control investments; for some it’s about planning. For some, it's about the total client experience—at the end of the day, that’s what they’re passionate about. It’s covering clients and delivering the best client experience.” Alex Ortolani Senior Reporter, WealthManagement.com Alex Ortolani is a New York-based senior reporter with WealthManagement.com with a focus on deals, moves and trends in the registered investment advisor space.

Title: Foreign exchange fintech firm Alt21 enlists former Global Shares chair
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/10/15/foreign-exchange-fintech-firm-alt21-enlists-former-global-shares-chair/

Alt21, a Dublin-based low-cost foreign exchange fintech, has appointed the former chairman of Global Shares to its board in a move that it seen as opening doors to strategic investment to accelerate its growth. Andy Stewart led an investment in 2018 by New York private equity firm Motive Partners, in which he is an industry partner, into Cork-based Global Shares, which administers employee share plans for companies. Motive Partners was the biggest winner when JP Morgan acquired Global Shares three years ago for $730 million (€632 million) to mark one of the most successful exits by an Irish fintech. Mr Stewart was Global Shares’s executive chairman at the time. Motive Partners had a 40 per cent stake. Alt21, once known as Assure Hedge, was founded almost a decade ago by former financial derivatives trader Barry McCarthy. It is chaired by Richard Hayes, also an early investor in – and former chairman of – Global Shares. Pritesh Ruparel, chief executive of Alt21, said that Mr Stewart’s “deep experience in designing capital structures for scalable global fintechs is invaluable” to the company. “I look forward to working closely with Andy to help us secure the optimal capital structure and the scale of financing that matches our ambition,” he said. Alt21 offers multi-currency solutions for small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) at a fraction of rates charged by banks and brokers, which dominate the market. It started providing services in the UK in 2021 under authorisation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It also recently secured authorisation in Malta, which will allow it to offer services across the EU, including Ireland. [ Dublin fintech firm Alt21 raises further $12.5m in fundingOpens in new window ] While fintechs Revolut and Wise have managed to prise a slice of foreign exchange business from banks in the micro-SME space over the past decade, Alt21 is aimed more at medium-sized firms, where its systems can be integrated into existing payroll and accounting systems. Half of the company’s 65 staff are understood to be engineers. The company raised $12.5 million earlier this year in a so-called series A funding round, bringing total investment to date to $44 million. “Alt21 is tackling one of the biggest inefficiencies still facing global mid-market businesses, the hidden costs and complexity of managing, moving, or earning interest on their money,” said Mr Stewart, who previously held senior roles at Blackrock, Credit Suisse and Man Investments. “I’m excited to join the board and support the company in its ambition to scale into a truly global disruptive brand.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
