Title: What happened in crypto this week?
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/what-happened-in-crypto-this-week-2/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T22:58:03Z
Full Content:
It’s been another busy week in crypto: Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is planning to launch a stablecoin, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hit $30 billion in assets in 293 days, ex-FTX executive Nishad Singh avoided prison, and Immutable received a Wells notice from the SEC. Let’s take a closer look at these and give you a recap on what happened this week in crypto. With the US election drawing closer, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial project plans on entering the crypto market by linking a stablecoin to the US dollar. The news of this comes as the project raised $14 million in initial funding; however, despite intentions to capitalize on the growing demand for stablecoins, the project saw limited success, falling short of its $300 million token sale. On top of that, shortly after the sale went live, the platform’s website crashed and even though 100,000 people signed up, only 6,832 unique wallets hold WLFI tokens, according to Etherscan. With only a few days until election day, if Trump does become the US President again, he would hold significant influence over the regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins, which could be a pivotal move for the future of WLFI. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has set a new record, reaching $30 billion in assets in 293 days. By doing so, it surpasses gold, which did it in 1,790 days and JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ($JEPI), which did it in 1,272 days. BlackRock holds more than 433,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.5 billion, according to iShares data. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million in shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. With the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs, they now have over one million in Bitcoin holdings and could soon pass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin. 12,000 btc a day keeps the doctor away lol. At this rate they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they? https://t.co/dLVNsjMlxK — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Earlier this week, Nishad Singh, the former engineering director of crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release in a federal court in New York. Judge Lewis Kaplan said, “this may have been one of the biggest crimes in American history.” Kaplan also noted that Singh’s involvement appeared limited compared to FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Due to “substantial assistance” from Singh, his lawyers argued for a lenient sentence. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and Ellison is expected to surrender by November 7 and was sentenced to 24 months in prison. As the crackdown on FTX executives continues, Singh is the fourth former executive to receive sentencing, with co-founder Gary Wang set to face court on November 20. Blockchain gaming platform Immutable has become the latest to receive a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging securities laws violations. According to Immutable, nothing was specified in the notice; however, it believes its “claims are targeting the listing and private sales of IMX in 2021.” Immutable has said they are confident that the IMX token is not a security. Immutable said the Wells notice before the US election illustrates why the “industry is so skeptical of any attempts from this SEC to argue it is attempting to provide clarity.” “Prior to the issuance of a Wells notice, there are often multiple months of interviews and conversations between company counsel and the SEC, so the SEC can fully understand the situation,” Immutable added. “Instead, in our very first interaction with the SEC, we were told a Wells notice would be issued to the company within the week. We then received it within hours.” Immutable joins a list of companies in the crypto industry that have faced or are facing lawsuits against the SEC. Other crypto organizations that have received a Wells notice from the SEC include Coinbase, Crypto.com, and OpenSea.

Title: Vivek Ramaswamy’s anti-DEI, pro-Bitcoin financial services company moving HQ to Dallas

businessBanking By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter Strive Enterprises, a financial services company co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced Friday that it will move its headquarters to Dallas. In a press release, the company said it expects most of its staff will move to Dallas from its current Columbus, Ohio headquarters by the end of Q1 2025. It is also launching a wealth management division — to be focused on “integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios” — to complement its existing asset management platform. Founded in 2022, Strive currently has $1.7 billion in assets under management and seeks to combat, “social and political agendas” in the financial world, according to its website. The site names DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and ESG (environmental, social and governance; sometimes called impact investing) initiatives as particular concerns. Major firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and the Dallas area’s own Charles Schwab, all with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, incorporate DEI and ESG strategies. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “When Strive launched in 2022, nearly every major corporation bent the knee to ESG,” Ramaswamy said in the release. “Just two short years later, the national environment has changed dramatically, in no small part due to Strive’s efforts. The moment is now ripe to launch a pro-capitalism Wealth Management business focused on true financial freedom, with a focus on integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios.” Governor Greg Abbott points to Strive’s relocation as the latest development in the growth of Y’all Street, the nickname given to Texas’ booming financial sector. “Texas has become the home of capital in the United States,” Abbott said in the release. “With the Best Business Climate in the nation and as the top state for corporate relocation and expansion projects, Texas is the future hub of capital markets that will help cement our economic power on the global stage.” Ramaswamy rose to national prominence during his run for the Republican presidential nomination throughout 2023. Having launched pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences in 2014, Ramaswamy billed himself as an “anti-woke” entrepreneur and drew attention for controversial pitches such as those to shut down the Department of Education, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After taking fourth in the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign in January 2024. He has since been on the campaign trail for former President Donald Trump, and has stated interest in Ohio’s governorship and Senate seat, as well as in a potential Trump cabinet seat. Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News. She has previously worked for the news department at Car and Driver magazine and served as the sports managing editor of The Duke Chronicle. She graduated from Duke in 2023 with a degree in Russian, a certificate in Policy, Journalism and Media Studies, and a minor in political science.

Title: The Regime Goes After Elon Musk

This is a lightly edited transcript of the accompanying video from professor Peter St. Onge. Recently, Elon Musk gave a talk detailing the government attacks on his companies since he came out as pro-free speech and, especially, since he came out as pro-Donald Trump. These include endless made-up environmental rules—including a study to see if falling rockets hit sharks. It includes curbs on SpaceX launches specifically because Elon tweets pro-Trump things. And it includes a $600,000 fine for spilling … drinking water in a desert. Not a joke. Attacking dissident companies, of course, is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. As Mussolini put it, “everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.” For a true authoritarian no citizen is allowed to dissent—and certainly no companies, which are sitting ducks. Of course, in theory, this sort of thing doesn’t happen in America. In theory, we jail bureaucrats who conduct Mussolini-style lawfare. Alas, it has been going on ever since the progressives imposed the administrative state about a hundred years ago. Saddling now every industry in America with a regime Big Brother, a library worth of regulations, mandates, licensing boards—a bureaucratic army that, like everything government does, is thoroughly corrupt. Still, before Donald Trump there was some independence. CEOs could still criticize regime shibboleths like mandatory racism—er, affirmative action—or transvestites in girls’ locker rooms if anybody had been dumb enough to propose that in 2015. Sadly, that all changed as authoritarian Borg went to war with Trump, culminating in the reign of terror during COVID-19 that snuffed out the slightest hint of disloyalty with an enthusiasm that would make North Korea blush. We saw it in living color during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots. Historically, about 70% of Fortune 500 CEOs vote Republican. Meaning that, statistically, at least 70% of them were probably horrified by BLM’s orgy of city-burning and murder. And yet not one Fortune 500 CEO spoke up. Now, you might say that’s because most are spineless cowards, and that’s true. But look at it from their perspective: You’re entrusted with tens of thousands of employees, and if you speak up, rioters will come beat them, burn their workplaces, and put them out of a job and your shareholders out of a retirement account. You could, like Elon, be targeted by hundreds of regulators—even prosecutors in blue cities—hunting with a fine-tooth comb for some way, any excuse, to destroy the entire company. For a CEO with a legal duty to protect the company—and a moral duty to protect employees—it’s simply too risky. So, they shut up. To be sure, many indulged, enthusiastically jumping on the institutionalized racism of DEI or cutting checks to the very rioters burning cities—in fact, BLM cashed more than $50 billion in corporate donations. Not since Genghis Khan has burning a city been quite so profitable. But others never drank the Kool-Aid. They may have opposed the Left with every fiber of their being. But they were held hostage by rioters, prosecutors, regulators, even financiers like BlackRock. So, what’s next? The solution is very easy: Get rid of the administrative state. Lay off the hundreds or thousands of little Mussolinis populating every regulatory agency from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Supreme Court laid the groundwork earlier this year with its Loper Bright decision clipping bureaucrats’ wings. And Musk himself has been floated by Trump for a blue-ribbon panel slashing government waste and corruption. The final step is Congress sitting down and actually defunding these agencies. Zero them out. Return the money to the people. Return the bureaucrats to jobs that don’t involve extortion. And let Americans get back to exercising our rights without being destroyed. We publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal. Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi’s holdings ‘in less than two weeks’ – Analyst

Spot BTC ETFs have amassed over 50% of the assets held by Gold ETFs in just 10 months. Less than a year post-launch, U.S. Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC. This is significant as just recently, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, had predicted that the ETFs could surpass the holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator – Satoshi Nakamoto. At the time, he had projected that this would happen by mid-December. However, BlackRock’s single-day purchase of 12,127 BTC, according to Lookonchain, has hastened the timeline. Balchunas reacted to this massive accumulation on X, stating, “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” At press time, BlackRock held 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $30.8 billion. Combined, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now manage assets totaling $70.86 billion, representing 5.12% of Bitcoin’s market cap. This, according to data from Soso Value. For context, Nakamoto holds an estimated 1.1 million BTC, currently worth $76 billion. Previously, AMBCrypto reported that on 30 October, BlackRock’s IBIT marked its largest single-day inflow since January. This surge in investment followed a trend of daily triple-digit total net inflows since 23 October. Source: Soso Value However, daily total net inflows dipped to $32.14 million on 31 October. Moreover, only IBIT and the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF (BRRR) brought in $318.80 million and $1.89 million, respectively. Other ETFs saw either outflows or no inflows at all. Interestingly, this drop coincided with the king coin losing its standing over the $70,000-level. Despite this decline, however, Balchunas revealed that IBIT managed to attract more cash than the total of 13,227 ETFs worldwide over the past week. He emphasized that this achievement is particularly significant for an ETF that is still under a year old. Source: Eric Balchunas/X IBIT’s remarkable performance didn’t go unnoticed by industry experts. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared his perspective on X: “This thing is turning into a $$$ vacuum cleaner.” Geraci highlighted that BTC ETFs’ $70 billion in assets was more than 50% of the $130 billion held by gold ETFs since 2004—All within just 10 months of their 2024 launch. Quinten Francois, Co-founder of WeRate, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Bitcoin ETFs had more inflows in the last 2 days than the Gold ETF took in during its entire first year.” Meanwhile, the Uptober rally came to an end with BTC’s 16th anniversary, marking the day Nakamoto released the nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This milestone laid the foundation for a decentralized digital currency and the cryptocurrency era. Interestingly, on its anniversary, Bitcoin dipped below the $70,000-mark. At press time, it was valued at $69,821, down by 3.33% over the last 24 hours. While the downturn may have disappointed some, it also poses an intriguing question – Could this be an opportunity for institutional investors to “buy the dip” and takeover Nakamoto sooner than expected? Such a move would accelerate the shift towards institutional dominance in a space Nakamoto originally envisioned as decentralized.

Title: Why Everyone’s Wrong About Stablecoins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2024/11/01/why-everyones-wrong-about-stablecoins/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T16:42:28Z
Full Content:
The Stripe Inc. headquarters in South San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, April 16, 2024. ... [+] Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Stripe’s recent acquisition of stablecoin orchestration startup Bridge sent shockwaves through the crypto world. For the first time, a major payments company committed over a billion dollars to accelerate its use of this technology. Though this isn’t Stripe’s first attempt at crypto, the timing feels different. Enthusiasm for stablecoins is at an all-time high, and Bridge’s co-founder, Zach Abrams, positioned the company masterfully: by branding it as the ‘Stripe of crypto,’ he ensured it would catch the attention of the Collison brothers. What most miss: Bridge might be worth $1.1 billion to Stripe, but on its own, it likely wouldn’t have hit that mark. This isn’t due to any lack of talent—Zach and his team assembled a top group of engineers—but rather because making money with stablecoins is extremely challenging. Whether through issuing, orchestrating (i.e., converting between stablecoins), or integrating them with legacy banking rails, achieving long-term profitability will be a significant challenge. But how can that be? After all, Circle and Tether have been raking in substantial profits following the interest rate hikes of the last two years, and with ongoing anticipation around a Circle IPO, the market appears primed for further growth and consolidation. The reality is that network effects in the stablecoin market are likely much weaker than most anticipate, and it’s far from a winner-take-all environment. In fact, stablecoins may well function as loss leaders, and without essential complementary assets, could even become a losing venture. While industry insiders often cite liquidity as the primary reason only a few stablecoins will dominate, the truth is far more complex. So what are the biggest misconceptions about stablecoins? Let’s take a closer look. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether Holdings Ltd. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg When we designed Libra, it was clear to us that stablecoins require a complementary business model to thrive. The Libra ecosystem was structured around a non-profit association that brought together wallets, merchants, and digital platforms to support both stablecoin issuance and the payment rails on which these assets would move. Relying solely on reserve interest isn’t a sustainable way to monetize a stablecoin. We learned this early on, as we were planning to issue stablecoins backed by currencies with minimal (Euro) or even negative (Yen) interest rates at the time. Stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether seem to overlook that today’s high-interest environment is an anomaly, and a sustainable business can’t be built on a foundation that’s likely to crumble when market conditions shift. Of course, it’s not just the ‘stock’ of stablecoins that can be monetized; their ‘flow’ can be too. Circle’s recent increase in redemption fees suggests they’re starting to realize this. However, this approach violates a fundamental principle in payments: to build user trust and retention, entry and exit must be seamless. While exit fees may be acceptable in gaming, they’re a poor fit for mainstream payments, as they undermine the basic expectation that money should feel unrestricted and readily available. This leaves transaction fees as a potential revenue source—but enforcing them on a blockchain is challenging without strict control over the protocol. Even then, it’s impossible to impose fees on transactions occurring between users within the same wallet provider. These are all scenarios we explored exhaustively with Libra, highlighting just how complex and uncertain the business model was for the non-profit association. So what options do stablecoin issuers have? Unless they’re relying on temporary regulatory loopholes—which are unlikely to hold long-term (more on that in the next section)—they’ll need to start competing with their own customers. Circle’s recent initiatives—including programmable wallets, a cross-chain protocol, and the Mint program—reveal exactly where the company is going. And that’s unwelcome news for many of its closest partners. This is nothing new in platform strategy: never allow a partner to come between you and your customers. Yet, many exchanges and payments companies are doing just that by letting Circle into their ecosystem. For Circle to survive, it must transition into a payments company, even if that means encroaching on its allies’ territory. It’s a familiar pattern—think of Amazon with third-party sellers, travel platforms with hotel chains, or Facebook with news publishers. As platforms succeed, they frequently bring in-house the functions they initially depended on partners to bootstrap and refine, adopting and monetizing what works. Developers within Apple’s and Google’s ecosystems are all too familiar with this. Stripe doesn’t face this dilemma. As one of the world’s most successful payments companies, they’ve mastered the art of deploying and monetizing a streamlined software layer on top of global money movement—a model that scales efficiently through network effects without being slowed down by the need for country-specific banking licenses. Stablecoins accelerate this approach by acting as a bridge between Stripe and domestic banking and payment rails. What was once a network constrained by legacy institutions—including card companies—can now overcome its last-mile problem, delivering significantly more value to merchants and consumers. This is also why PayPal launched its own stablecoin, with other fintech giants like Revolut and Robinhood soon joining the fray. Competing on open protocols is a shift from their usual playbook, but they can fine-tune their stablecoin strategy to complement their core offerings. In doing so, they’ll make stablecoins exceptionally affordable and convenient for consumers and businesses alike. Argentine peso banknotes equivalent to 1,000 US dollars arranged in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on ... [+] Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023. Photographer: Erica Canepa/Bloomberg Crypto has a history of greatly underestimating the influence of regulation on its future. We learned this the hard way with the release of the first Libra whitepaper, which led to two grueling years of intense regulatory interactions to align the project with the expectations of policymakers and regulators. The same is true for stablecoins today. Many assume that stablecoins will seamlessly operate as low-cost, global dollar accounts for consumers and businesses. After all, in a crisis, everyone in the world would prefer to hold dollars in a too-big-to-fail U.S. financial institution. Moreover, one might think the U.S. government would support this, as it strengthens the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. The reality is far more complex. While the United States risks losing a great deal if its financial and sanctions infrastructure is no longer the global standard—and would face even greater consequences if the dollar’s ‘exorbitant privilege’ erodes, as it has for every reserve currency before it—this doesn’t mean the U.S. Treasury will always favor accelerating dollarization. In fact, its Office of International Affairs would view this as a significant challenge to both diplomacy and global financial stability. Countries that value monetary policy independence, fear capital flight in a crisis, and worry about destabilizing their domestic banks will strongly oppose the large-scale adoption of frictionless USD stablecoin accounts. They’ll use every tool available to block or limit these accounts, just as they’ve resisted other forms of dollarization. And while it may be impossible to stop crypto transactions entirely, as the Internet has shown, governments have numerous ways to restrict access and curb mainstream adoption. Does this mean stablecoins are doomed in emerging economies with capital controls or concerns over capital flight? Not at all—the rise of domestic stablecoins that adhere to local banking and regulatory frameworks is inevitable. While the U.S. dollar has traditionally dominated the stablecoin market, things could change rapidly. In Europe, following the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, banks, fintech companies, and new entrants are rushing to issue euro-denominated stablecoins. This approach has the benefit of preserving the stability of the local banking system, and will be even more important in regions like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Clear regulation also enables banks to finally enter and compete on an equal footing, something that hasn’t yet occurred in the United States. Banks can issue deposit tokens in addition to fully-backed stablecoins, allowing them to boost revenue through money creation. This puts pure-play stablecoin issuers—who lack banking licenses, access to the discount window, or government deposit insurance—at a significant competitive disadvantage. Icons for various payment services are displayed in Hong Kong, China. Photographer: Anthony ... [+] Kwan/Bloomberg Yes, an issuer can build network effects around global liquidity and availability for its stablecoin, but as DEX protocols know all too well, liquidity is as easily lost as found. Similarly, economies of scale in branding and marketing may help issuers capture mindshare, but they don’t always translate into a truly defensible position. The reality is that a stablecoin’s most important feature—its peg to a currency like USD or EUR—is also its greatest weakness. Today, these assets are seen as distinct, but once regulation standardizes stablecoins and makes each equally safe, individuals and businesses will view them simply as dollars or euros. While legal distinctions do exist—as highlighted during the Silicon Valley Bank run—most people don’t differentiate between dollars held at Bank of America and those at Chase. That’s the magic of those dollars functioning as money—a feat orchestrated behind the scenes by the Federal Reserve. The same will be true for stablecoins. While there may be dozens in each major market, this complexity will be abstracted away for users. When that happens, the economics of stablecoins will favor entities with either a complementary business model, as described above, or those that control the interface between stablecoins and the assets backing them—be it bank deposits, U.S. treasuries, or money market funds. That is bad news for pure-play issuers like Circle, whose current banking system interfaces depend on entities such as BlackRock and BNY Mellon. These financial giants are well-positioned to become direct competitors. For instance, BlackRock already operates the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury bills and repos fund (BUIDL). A common misconception in the history of technological disruption is how frequently incumbents manage to push back. Even Clayton Christensen’s key example of disruptive innovation—the rise of smaller disk drive producers in the hard disk industry—is wrong: Seagate not only survived disruption but remains the world’s largest manufacturer to this day. In heavily regulated industries like financial services, the odds are even more heavily stacked against new entrants. BERLIN, GERMANY - DECEMBER 05: Revolut Founder CEO Nikolay Storonsky, N26 Founder & CEO Valetin ... [+] Stalf and Monzo CEO Tom Blomfield (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch). Tech companies with banking licenses, like Revolut, Monzo, and Nubank, are well-positioned to lead in their markets, and other players are likely to accelerate their licensing efforts to gain similar advantages. However, many players in the stablecoin market will struggle to compete with established banks and may face acquisition or failure. Banks and credit card companies will resist a market dominated by one or two stablecoins. Instead, they’ll advocate for a landscape with multiple interoperable and interchangeable issuers. When that happens, liquidity and availability will be driven by existing distribution channels to consumers and merchants—an advantage already held by neobanks and payment companies like Stripe or Adyen. Fully-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT will need high-velocity use cases to remain viable—such as enabling cross-border money movement—or they’ll need to attract a DeFi ecosystem that can introduce transparent fractionalization to subsidize their narrow-bank model. Meanwhile, deposit tokens issued by banks or tokenized funds will benefit from stronger underlying economics, which will drive their adoption across both consumer and institutional use cases. Institutional users, in particular, are used to managing diverse assets like money market funds and pay close attention to the opportunity cost of their capital. The race to the bottom in sharing stablecoin yields is already well underway in that segment. In every region, national champions—from banks to crypto firms—will position themselves as the essential entry point into the local market. However, they’ll need to carefully consider how stablecoins, by linking domestic rails to blockchain networks, could also lower barriers for foreign competitors to enter and compete. After all, the core transformation here from a business perspective is that these systems will run on open protocols. Agustin Carstens, the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements. (Photo by Vernon ... [+] Yuen/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The future is bright for leading payments, fintech, and neobank players, who can leverage stablecoins to streamline operations and accelerate global expansion. It also opens new opportunities for domestic stablecoin issuers to position themselves and ready their payment systems for global interoperability—an area where stablecoins are poised to succeed where the bureaucratic BIS’s ‘Finternet’ vision will quickly fall short. Leading crypto exchanges will also leverage stablecoins to enter the consumer and merchant payments space more aggressively, positioning themselves as credible challengers to major fintech and payment companies. While questions remain about how stablecoins will scale AML and compliance controls as they go mainstream, there’s no doubt they offer an opportunity to rapidly modernize our financial services stack and shake up industry leadership.

Title: Bitcoin at 16: Getting Its Driver's License and Entering a New Era
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/11/01/bitcoin-at-16-getting-its-drivers-license-and-entering-a-new-era/

Full Content:
Election 2024 coverage presented by On October 31, Bitcoin turned 16 — the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the whitepaper that changed financial history. At 16, Bitcoin is no longer just a rebellious experiment; it’s entering a critical phase where it’s being tested on a much larger scale. Bitcoin is getting its proverbial driver's license, ready to navigate the open roads of the global financial system. The question is: can it handle the complexities ahead? Bitcoin has evolved beyond "digital gold." Today, it's a foundational piece of global financial infrastructure. 2024 has seen the rise of Bitcoin Layer 2s, Ordinals, and institutional adoption, which shows we’re at a critical inflection point. Perhaps the most defining moment of Bitcoin’s 16th year has been the entrance of institutions. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs, led by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco, marked a historic shift. As of mid-2024, these ETFs have collectively attracted over $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM), providing a significant capital influx into the market. This institutional wave reflects a growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure through traditional financial vehicles. BlackRock alone manages trillions of dollars in assets, and its involvement signals that Bitcoin is no longer seen as a fringe asset but a serious contender in the global financial arena. So how can Bitcoin maintain its decentralized ethos while absorbing billions in institutional capital? For those of us building on Bitcoin, this is the challenge we face: to keep Bitcoin permissionless and resilient, even as it becomes mainstream. Layer 2 solutions like Lightning (now five years old) have transformed how Bitcoin is used, in regions with unstable currencies, Lightning has proven to help with payments; however, adoption in developed markets has been slower than many anticipated. This slower-than-expected adoption shouldn’t be seen as a failure but rather as a reflection of Bitcoin’s maturing role as a broader infrastructure layer. In fact, this shift from immediate use cases like payments to longer-term infrastructure development is arguably a positive sign. For a majority of the world, we're in a new era where we've separated BTC, the asset, from Bitcoin, the rails. BTC will remain the most inflation-resistant Lindy asset. The rails where you now access BTC on chain will matter. Transacting on the L1 may be considered a high-value, "luxury" settlement only where L2s offer a cheaper, faster, and better means of moving onchain. Take Stacks, a programmable layer for Bitcoin which began in 2018. The just-activated Nakamoto upgrade for Stacks represents a significant leap forward regarding Bitcoin liquidity and integration into both traditional and decentralized financial systems. With the sBTC protocol live as of two days ago, we're looking at an ecosystem where Bitcoin can be used more flexibly without sacrificing decentralization. Stacks' sBTC brings Bitcoin liquidity without requiring centralized exchanges, solving a long-standing problem in Bitcoin's integration into DeFi. Through projects like Granite, Stacks is providing tools for decentralized lending and borrowing without rehypothecation, keeping Bitcoin liquidity non-custodial and transparent. Stacks' native sBTC brings another layer of innovation, enabling users to move Bitcoin seamlessly across various applications without losing its decentralized qualities. People now realize their BTC has significant value and are looking for avenues to safely invest their BTC for yield, get liquidity against it, or acquire more BTC. It's less about spending BTC freely but more about managing risk not to lose your BTC and never to sell. That's why protocols like Granite exist, offering a transparent on-chain way to borrow against without selling. When you bridge/wrap BTC to another on-chain asset, you want it to feel like Bitcoin – the same network robustness, resilience, and decentralization. Technological innovations like BitVM, which introduces complex smart contracts to Bitcoin, and OP_Cat, which brings covenant-based programming, are opening new doors. These advancements enable more advanced governance models to be built on Bitcoin without compromising security. This pivot toward programmability marks a new chapter for Bitcoin. And by mid-2024, projects like Coinbase's cbBTC have tokenized Bitcoin for applications, with cbBTC acting as collateral in lending protocols, mirroring the success of Ethereum's wrapped assets — yet another indicator that Bitcoin is broadening its utility beyond simple buy-and-hold strategies. At 16, Bitcoin is maturing into more than just a monetary asset — it’s becoming the infrastructure for a decentralized world. With hundreds of Layer 2s launching, Bitcoin is becoming something far expansive than perhaps Satoshi ever intended. We’re now building a financial future where Bitcoin is now the rails for decentralized finance, digital identities and smart contracts. Bitcoin's programmability through technologies like Stacks and BitVM offers capabilities once thought to be better suited to other blockchains. While institutional interest is a significant milestone, it raises concerns about how Bitcoin’s core values — decentralization, security, and permissionlessness — can be preserved. EFTs are great for massive awareness and adoption but leave less freely circulating BTC on-chain. With billions of capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, institutions will play a major role in Bitcoin's future. Therefore, Bitcoin builders must ensure that this doesn’t come at the expense of Bitcoin’s core principles. To put this in perspective, institutions like BlackRock are wielding financial influence that have the potential to influence Bitcoin’s ecosystem. For instance, its AUM dwarfs the entire market capitalization of many cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin at 16 is not about having all the answers; it’s about having the tools, the developers, and the vision to keep building. All paths are leading to users wanting consumer crypto — a place where Ordinals, Runes, and DeFi can thrive. But we’ve hardly just begun. The road ahead is vast, but with the right builders steering, the journey has only begun.

UBS Asset Management, a subsidiary of Zurich-headquartered investment bank UBS, has launched its inaugural tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to expand access for its clients. According to a Nov. 1 statement, the new product — the “UBS USD Money Market Investment Fund Token” or “uMINT” — offers clients an innovative investment solution. Token holders will gain access to UBS Asset Management’s institutional-grade cash management strategy, which utilizes high-quality money market instruments under a conservative, risk-managed framework. Thomas Kaegi, Co-Head of UBS Asset Management, emphasized that the launch aligns with increasing investor interest in tokenized assets. He commented: “We have seen growing investor appetite for tokenized financial assets across asset classes. Through leveraging our global capabilities and collaborating with peers and regulators, we can now provide clients with an innovative solution.” This launch also supports UBS’s broader “UBS Tokenize” initiative, which began in June 2023 by creating fully digitally structured notes worth CNH 200 million for a third-party issuer. By November, UBS had executed the first-ever cross-border repurchase transaction using a natively issued digital bond on a public blockchain. UBS Asset Management said these efforts reflect its ongoing commitment to both public and private blockchain networks, enabling it to expand offerings like fund issuance and distribution, creating more streamlined and accessible financial products. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS managed $5.7 trillion of its clients’ invested assets. The company operates in more than 50 markets worldwide. Tokenization, representing traditional assets such as the US Treasury-backed money market funds on blockchain networks, has gained significant traction among established finance firms, including BlackRock, over the past year. Notably, the US Treasury Department has acknowledged tokenization’s potential to reshape markets, noting that it could boost efficiency, broaden investor access, and increase transparency in the Treasury market.

Cllr Garret Kelleher speaking about Ballincollig TidyTowns, the overall winner's of this year's competition Ballincollig has been crowned as the winner of the 2024 Supervalu Tidy Towns competition in Croke Park this afternoon. They received the overall winner award and the €15,000 in prize money for being the highest scoring entrant in the whole competition. Cllr Garret Kelleher, who is a long-serving member of Ballincollig TidyTowns said it has been “years and years in the making” after the group placed second last year. It marks the groups twelfth overall gold medal in a row, as well as building on their Tidiest Large Urban Centre win in last year’s competition and in 2018. Pictured at the 2024 SuperValu TidyTowns competition was (at centre) Luke Hanlon, Managing Director of SuperValu; Tom Butler, Chairperson, Ballincollig Tidy Town Committee; and Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, along with members of the Ballincollig Tidy Town Committee at the awards ceremony at Croke Park. Pic:Naoise Culhane “We thought it was never going to happen that we would actually get to the top, so today is just the result of years and years of hard work and it’s fantastic. “I’m delighted for everyone involved because there is a great community spirit in Ballincollig,” he said. Cllr Kelleher said there is great friendships and comradery within the Cork group, based 8km west of Cork City. “This is just brilliant, particularly for some of our senior members,” he said, paying tribute to one of the groups “stalwarts” Tony Whelan, who passed two years ago today. “No doubt he is looking down on us now and he would be very proud,” Cllr Kelleher said. The group is comprised of close to 90 volunteers, however on any given Sunday, the group would have 18 to 30 people out taking part in clean-ups and initiatives. He said that “there is so much more” to the work of Tidy Towns than what is commonly associated with it, namely litter picking. “It’s getting businesses and it’s getting the community to improve,” he added. As well as improving the built environment and streetscape, Ballincollig TidyTowns runs initiatives getting businesses to change to energy-efficient light bulbs, introduce re-usable coffee cups and setting up cleaner air initiatives. A lot of their work is done with local schools, with one using rainwater from its roof to harvest and water flowers around the town. He also stressed the importance of Tidy Towns in bringing people from different ethnic backgrounds and of all different ages working together. “Without Tidy Towns their circles wouldn’t interact. Tidy Towns is a big melting pot. It’s always about whatever somebody can give time wise,” he said. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys, was on hand to present Ballincollig and all of the other winners in each of the categories with their awards, on top of announcing an additional €1.5 million in funding for over 900 groups. “Today you are all winners. What you do for your communities is admirable and commendable… you are out there whether rain, hail or shine,” Ms Humphreys said. MC Marty Morrissey said the awards ceremony at a packed out Hogan Suite in Croke Park was a “celebration of place”. A total of 904 towns and villages entered the competition this year, which has been running for 66 years. In place since 1958, the competition, administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development and sponsored by SuperValu, has grown beyond a competition into a national sustainability movement. Luke Hanlon, Managing Director of SuperValu paid tribute to the efforts of 30,000 volunteers across the island, with over one million hours put in by committees across the country this year. He also commended volunteers, 20pc of which are under 25 years old, for planting 108,000 trees and 200,000 square metres of flower beds. Towns and villages big and small across the country entered, ranging from the smallest in Category A – populations of under 200, to the largest, Category H – with 25,001 and over. A total of 80 Tidy Town centres were awarded gold medals. “Let’s acknowledge the efforts of all our volunteers,” Morrissey said, before a resounding cheer rung out for the medal winners. Silver and Bronze Medals, along with the 80 gold medals were also also given to entrants with scores that fall within a set range from that year’s winning score. Ireland’s tidiest village award went to Ballynahown in County Westmeath, which has a total population of 75 people, while Ireland’s tidiest small town went to Blackrock in County Louth. The winner of Ireland’s tidiest large town for 2024 was announced as Westport, while Ireland’s Tidiest Large Urban Centre went to Ballincollig. Minister Humphreys also presented the Young Person in TidyTowns award to Ballyphehane TidyTowns , Cork as well as the ‘Town Centre First National Award’ today to Carrickmacross TidyTowns, Co Monaghan. This was in recognition of their tremendous efforts to address vacancy and dereliction in line with the Government’s ‘Town Centre First‘ policy. A series of Endeavour Awards were given out for the biggest improvement by an entrant in each county from the previous year. There were also County Awards for the top three entrants in each county and Regional Awards for the top-scoring entrant in each region. The national island award went to Bere Island off the West Cork coast, while Belmullet TidyTowns won best Gaeltacht area. Assessment of participating towns was carried out by an independent panel of adjudicators appointed by the department during the months of June, July and August.

Ballincollig in Co Cork has been named the overall winner of the 2024 Supervalu TidyTowns Competition. Westport in Co Mayo was named Ireland’s tidiest large town, while Ballincollig also received the award for tidiest large urban centre, securing the award for the second year running. The coastal town of Blackrock in Co Louth received the award for tidiest small town while Ballinahown in Co Westmeath, which has a population of just 75 people, was named Ireland’s tidiest village. Some 30,000 volunteers from 904 towns and villages across Ireland took part in this year’s competition, representing one million hours of work. Cork City Councillor Garrett Kelleher, a long-standing member of the award-winning Ballincollig TidyTowns group, said the nearly 90 local volunteers represented “everything that’s best about community” and gathered together to work “for the greater good, for the benefit of the community”. He noted the group’s work also focused on taking “small steps” to encourage the wider community and local businesses to get more involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “A lot of people on the outside might associate it with the likes of litter picking and nice floral presentations but there’s so much more to it now.” The group brings together “people from different ethnic backgrounds” and “different ages, old and young” who under normal circumstances might never meet one another, he added. Mr Kelleher also paid tribute to former “stalwart” of the Ballincollig group, the late Tony Whelan. “He actually didn’t really want to win the national award because he said, by not winning it, it kept the standards high, and we were always striving to achieve it. But two years after his passing, the great Tony Whelan is looking down on us and would be very proud.” The winners of the 2024 competition were presented with their awards by Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys and Supervalu managing director Luke Hanlon at the ceremony in Croke Park on Friday. More than €270,000 in prize money was awarded to groups across all categories in this year’s competition. Welcoming all participants to Croke Park, RTÉ broadcaster Marty Morrissey, who hosted the awards for the first time, underlined the national importance of the event. “This is Ireland,” said Mr Morrissey. “This is pride of place, this is about being from somewhere, wherever it is and it’s your country, your village, your town, your province. And we’re all from somewhere.” Mr Hanlon said that when individuals act together “no action is too small, local initiatives can spark global change, TidyTowns is testament to this”. The work of these communities focuses on “planting trees that will outlive us, clearing spaces where our children’s children will play and building communities that will thrive for generations,” he said. Mr Hanlon paid tribute to the 15 per cent of TidyTowns volunteers who were born outside Ireland and who bring “fresh perspectives” to the work. Ms Humphreys paid special tribute to all the children involved in the youth award, adding that all volunteers had been “instrumental in making our communities more attractive, inclusive and sustainable places for everyone”. Some 80 groups across the State received gold medals with special mentions for the town of Clane in Co Kildare, Monaghan town in Co Monaghan and the parish of Abbey in Co Galway. Bere Island off the coast of west Cork received the national island award; Beal an Mhuirthead TidyTowns in Co Mayo received the Gaeltacht award; Carrickmacross TidyTowns in Co Monaghan received the award for best town centre and the Balla Community TidyTowns group in Co Mayo received the inclusive communities award. Other winners of special awards included Dunboyne Senior National School in Co Meath for the School award; the Cork suburb of Ballyphehane in Co Cork for the Young Persons award; Ardmore Tidytowns in Co Waterford for the Heritage award and Portlaoise TidyTowns for the Tree Project award. The Supervalu TidyTowns competition, which is now in its 66th year, was cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while in 2021 it was operated as remotely as possible and under strict social distancing rules. It returned as normal in 2022. In June of this year, Randalstown in Co Antrim was named Ireland’s Best Kept Town for 2024 in the separate all-island competition. Also among the winners were Malin in Co Donegal, which won Best Kept Village, and Roscommon which won Best Kept Large Town. The Ireland’s Best Kept Towns award, which is run by the Northern Ireland Amenity Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, allows the top towns from the Northern Ireland amenity council’s Best Kept Awards and the Supervalu TidyTowns Competition to compete with each other.

Title: Franklin Templeton Becomes First Asset Manager to Build a Tokenized Fund on Base

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Franklin Templeton became the first tokenized money fund on Coinbase’s Layer-2 (L2) blockchain late last night (on October 31). $FBOXX is already valued at a whopping $408M. By joining the largest L2 network by Total Value Locked (TVL), Templeton aims to boost the government money market fund’s appeal further. Since its initiation in 2021, the fund has primarily invested in US government securities with minimal credit risks. It ultimately aims to provide capital safety and easy access to treasury bills while maintaining a $1 share price. It’s the third largest treasury product in the $2.40B RWA market, hot on the heels of BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($BUIDL) and Ondo US Dollar Yield ($USDY). Beyond Base, $FBOXX is available on five other blockchain networks: Stellar, Arbitrum, Aptos, Avalanche, and Polygon. Stellar is the fund’s primary network. It’s the second largest blockchain network in the treasury market with a $391M market cap. Ethereum’s mainnet (valued at $1.67B) leads the charge. Still, Franklin Templeton taps into Ethereum’s top-rated L2 scaling solutions productively. Base dominates with a TVL of $2.45B, followed by Arbitrum ($2.36B) and Polygon ($1.17B). The fund joined Polygon on April 26, 2023, to capitalize on its Ethereum-based (ERC-20) assets, which were valued at $260B at the time. Further boosting its attraction and decentralization is its partnership with the Layer-1 (L1) blockchains, Aptos and Avalanche. Aptos’ active addresses have spiked by 1,138.95% since last year (from 53.61K to 664.2K), signaling a favorable time for $FBOXX. $FBOXX sets a new benchmark in digital asset management by being the first-ever tokenized money fund to join Base. Expanding its accessibility across various blockchain networks, Franklin Templeton pushes the boundaries regarding costs, security, and the very nature of making financial transactions in the tokenized treasury market. As blockchain technology continues to gain traction in TradFi, $FBOXX’s multichain approach, and fractionalized RWAs might spur other financial companies to follow suit – especially when considering the RWA market is poised to hit $600B by 2030.

Title: Bitcoin Rally Masks Bleaker Picture in the Crypto World

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Beyond Bitcoin’s rally toward another all-time high and renewed ETF inflows, a bleaker picture of crypto is emerging, one where waning interest in once-hot assets prompts some companies to slash jobs. Most Read from Bloomberg Is Denver’s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off? The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link On Wednesday, crypto exchange Kraken announced job cuts a person familiar with the matter said amounts to 15% of workers, while rival Coinbase Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates. Software developer Consensys is among other digital-asset firms that recently started trimming jobs. Such cuts fly in the face of Bitcoin’s recent strength and industry optimism that Donald Trump, a crypto convert, will soon be in the White House again. At the same time, many blockchains that were touted as Bitcoin alternatives have languished, and fundraising by crypto startups slumped in the third quarter by one estimate. “It has been a Bitcoin-dominant market this cycle,” said Toby Lewis, co-founder of OrdinalsBot. “The hope of the wider crypto industry is that this will rotate into alternative coins, but this has taken longer than many expected.” A look at performance among top cryptocurrencies this year drives home the industry bifurcation. Bitcoin is up some 64% since Jan. 1, and Solana has posted similar gains. Dogecoin, the memecoin associated with Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a staunch Trump supporter, has rallied almost 80%. Meanwhile, so-called altcoins like Polkadot, Polygon and Algorand have gotten hammered. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, was always the poster child for the sector’s booms and busts. But the hugely successful introduction of US exchange-traded funds backed by Bitcoin in January set the stage for its adoption on Wall Street, and the impact has been widely felt. BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now oversees $31 billion after drawing nearly $900 million of inflows on Wednesday alone. The spoils haven’t flowed to all corners of crypto. Venture capital investment in digital-asset startups tumbled 20% in the third quarter from the prior three months, to $2.4 billion, according to Galaxy. VC deals remain a far way off the go-go days or the 2021 bull market, showing how confidence has yet to fully recover from the crash that followed. Other areas of crypto, like nonfungible tokens and blockchain-based gaming, never fully recovered from the crisis that ravaged the industry two years ago. Crypto exchanges are a good barometer of overall industry health because they typically list hundreds of tokens big and small. Coinbase, the biggest US platform, missed on both revenue and profit for the third quarter, sending the stock plunging as much as 15% on Thursday. Kraken, which announced its job cuts in a blog post on Wednesday, said it’s making “organizational discipline decisions” to eliminate redundant management layers. As part of the C-suit reshuffle, its chief technology officer and chief product officer have left the company, and it appointed a new finance chief. Consensys, which provides software for the Ethereum network, is trimming 20% of its workforce while DYdX Trading Inc. recently said it’s firing more than a third of its employees. Many firms — including Consensys — attribute their problems at least in part to lack of clarity around US regulations. Perceived hostility from the US Securities and Exchange Commission has galvanized large swathes of the industry behind Trump, who has said he’d fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler if elected. “We’re seeing regulatory uncertainty potentially adding to costs for a number of large US operators including centralized exchanges,” said Evgeny Gokhberg, managing partner at crypto investment firm Re7 Capital. Polymarket, a crypto-based predictions marketplace, currently assigns a 63% chance of Trump winning the election. That’s a far higher probability than in opinion polls, which show the race essentially a toss-up. Such is Trump’s perceived impact on crypto that Bitcoin slumped on Friday as odds on his election fell in some betting markets. But even if he wins, large parts of the crypto industry will still face structural hurdles in turning ideas into profits. The struggles of some digital-asset companies are the result of the difficulty they’ve encountered in generating revenues from their technologies, according to Cristiano Ventricelli, a senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. “In addition, the industry exhibits high degree [of] fragmentation, both in practices and in the variety of products and services available, resulting in a marked disconnect between demand and supply,” he said in a written response to questions. --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Emily Nicolle.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-reaches-2-of-total-btc-supply-amid-record-inflows/

On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, achieved a significant milestone in the Bitcoin ETF market, recording the largest inflows since the inception of these investment funds in January. According to Bloomberg, approximately $872 million flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on Wednesday, marking a daily record for the fund. This influx highlights the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs, with subscriptions for this nine-month-old product ranking among the highest globally for ETFs in 2024. As a result of the inflows, BlackRock’s total holdings in Bitcoin now stand at 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $31.04 billion. This accounts for about 2.04% of Bitcoin’s total supply, capped at 21 million coins. The recent inflows are being attributed to a phenomenon dubbed the “Trump trade,” as pro-crypto Republican nominee Donald Trump gains momentum in betting markets ahead of the upcoming election day on November 5. Bitcoin is on the verge of reaching new heights, fueled by a 13% rally in October. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted on Bloomberg Television that the demand for these ETFs is palpable, suggesting that investors are responding not only to Bitcoin’s upward momentum but also to Trump’s favorable odds in the political arena. Trump has made headlines with his pledge to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” and to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the country to halve the US’s $35 trillion national debt. In contrast, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry but has not provided further details on how her potential new administration will address the community’s calls for a change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approach to digital assets. Amid bullish predictions for the leading crypto of the industry, market expert Ali Martinez has shared compelling insights regarding Bitcoin’s potential price trajectory for the months ahead. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Martinez analyzed historical patterns, noting that Bitcoin has typically peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels during past bull cycles. If this trend continues, Martinez predicts that Bitcoin could reach a price range between $174,000 and $462,000 in the current cycle. In addition to these price predictions, Martinez pointed to another bullish indicator: a significant outflow of Bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchanges. Over the past 48 hours, approximately 8,000 BTC, valued at around $576 million, have been withdrawn from exchanges. This trend signifies a growing inclination among investors to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell it, which can create upward pressure on prices as BTC inches closer to its all-time high level of $73,700 reached in March. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,640. This represents a retracement of 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

Full Content:
It has been a challenging year for restaurants, but despite the odds, the industry remains bold, and a new wave of restaurants made their debut – 18 of which make this list. These new openings are not just in Dublin; places like New Ross and Lismore are seeing exciting new spots, bringing fresh energy to local communities. You will find here also some beautiful places to plan a special night out with pals or family, just in time for the festive season. If you’re after something more low-key, our cosy and casual categories are ideal for laid-back meals with friends, while you can see where exceptional value is to be had in the smart money section. There are lots of options too for those who want to push the boat out for a date night, destination dining, or a glam evening. As always, it is a list of just 100, with a focus on new restaurants, so sadly we couldn’t include everyone. Be sure to support all your local favourites too. The most exciting east-Asian-inspired food in town at the moment comes from this Aston Quay restaurant, where a Santa Maria barbecue that has been custom-made by Smokin’ Soul is at the heart of the menu. Start with the by now legendary chargrilled mussels and work through the menu with some very fine cocktails. Read our review here. Corinna Hardgrave With the opening of casual Baba’de, Chef Ahmet Dede returns to the building where he earned the first of his two Michelin stars with Dede restaurant, partnering once again with Maria Archer. It’s charmingly named for Ahmet’s daughter Aleyna. During the morning, the menu is all about Turkish-style breakfast, while the evening offers an eclectic mixture of beguiling small plates. With the winter months closing in, look out for wine club evenings with guest sommeliers. Joanne Cronin Cork people are known to have deep feelings about the best chipper in the city, with KC & Sons from the Crawford family frequently a top contender. Now Josh Crawford, along with Arkansas-born wife Kate, is moving in a very different direction with the opening of Bayou, a New Orleans-inspired restaurant. For anyone who has ever been to the Big Easy, the menu of fried chicken and biscuits, beignets and muffulettas will feel immediately authentic. JC Jumoke Akintola and Peter Hogan have opened this luxe fish and chip shop in the beautiful first floor of their premises in Tramore. It is open year round – eat in (seating 20, now even cosier with a wood-burning stove), or takeaway – and offers an interesting wine list. A handful of smaller plates includes local seafood from Tramore Bay, such as crab or lobster salad, local prawns, or Duncannon smoked salmon and chowder, all served with their home-made soda bread. Beer battered fish and chips are €19.95; and plaice, John Dory, and turbot are available as daily specials at market prices. The Seafood Restaurant is closed for winter and will reopen in March 2025. CH If you’re starting to wonder whether the restaurant business is all gimmicks and Instagram filters these days, just head straight to Bearú in New Ross. By day, it’s a smart cafe, by night, a proper restaurant – no fuss, no frills – run by chef Dave Rowley and his wife, local woman Siobhán Ward. The menu’s tight, just three choices per course, and that’s because they cook what’s fresh – fish practically flapping in off the boats and seasonal produce. Read our review here. CH Affordable dumplings are the star in this stripped-back, budget-friendly joint, where the glowing neon CN Dumpling sign above your head is just about the fanciest thing in the room. You’ve got options: steamed, grilled, boiled, or drowned in a fierce Sichuan chilli broth, or snowflake style. There are sides too, such as a cucumber and jellyfish salad that’s as refreshing as it is unexpected. It’s the kind of place for popping into for a quick, tasty bite. Read our review here. CH There was a collective cheer when Coppinger swung open its freshly revamped doors back in August, and with chef Daniel Hannigan at the helm, the food has taken a serious step up. It’s a sharing plates affair, with no shortage of tasty options, and – thankfully – no minimum spend to box you in. The cocktails are a triumph. Start with the celery gimlet and work your way through the list. Read our review here. CH Fresh from a morning swim, Elaine Slattery used to drive to Lahinch for a hot chocolate. Wanting something closer to home, she transformed a 200-year-old cottage in Liscannor into Dolly’s coffee shop. Open since August, it’s now the spot for a post-dip hot chocolate, chai latte after a coastal walk, or a yoga-recovery matcha. Pastel de nata, Viennoisserie and sourdough are supplied from Hugo’s, there’s Happy Tummy bread, and organic vegetables and eggs from Moy Hill Farm. Upstairs is a community space for yoga, Pilates and poetry readings. Dogs are very welcome (it’s named after her own pooch). CH Stools hug the counters by the wall and window at chef Derek Kelly and Nicole Keegan’s Mount Merrion restaurant, while the snug delivers a proper sit-down vibe for those who like a bit more intimacy. The menu calls it “small and large plates”, but it easily adapts to starters and mains. Tasty, shareable dishes include free-range, spicy fried chicken and charred baby leeks smothered in ajo blanco, and it’s worth checking out the red prawn fregola. Read our review here. CH Storm Babet’s rampage through Midleton in east Cork in 2023 had a devastating impact on Farmgate Café, which Maróg O’Brien had opened in 1983. Now newly opened in Lismore in a heritage building that once played host to O’Brien’s Pub, there is a long counter area for walk-ins and diningroom at the back. The menu is based on local, seasonal produce which is cooked simply, preserving the original ethos of Farmgate. Read our review here. CH Floritz surely can lay claim to being the most glamorous diningroom in Ireland, bursting with bright colours and a luxe style that can only be described as Georgian tropical. Chef Matt Fuller oversees an extensive menu of small and large plates with a strong Asian influence. Groups can share plates of charcoal grilled yakitori, sushi, bao or dishes such as miso roast black cod. Read our review here. JC Forest Avenue feels like a neighbourhood spot until you taste what John Wyer does with suckling pig and vegetables from the McNally family farm and then you realise it’s quietly exceptional. The three-course lunch is a reasonable €49, while the evening tasting menu will set you back €89, a bargain for what they’re offering. And if that wasn’t enough, owners John and Sandy Wyer are doubling down with plans to open a French bistro next door, charmingly named Forêt. Read our review here. CH Owner Will Monaghan hit the headlines recently when he was candid about the struggle faced by city centre restaurants. Hidden is his latest venture, smack in the heart of Smithfield. The vibe here is similar to sister restaurant One Society, with tasty all-day brunch, switching to tapas, wine and pizza in the evenings, made using a wide range of produce from Irish suppliers. Read our review here. JC It’s a brave move to change a much-loved restaurant but that’s exactly what Andrea and Stephen McAllister did when they transformed The Pig’s Ear into Lotus Eaters. They describe it as serving the type of flavours that they love to cook at home. Pick and mix from dishes such as barbecue pork belly skewers, poached chicken salad with cucumber and rayu, or their signature Wagyu beef burger. Read our review here. JC Nádúr (meaning ‘nature’ in Irish) is the little sister to Cork’s much loved Good Day Deli. Owners Clare Condon and New Zealander Kristin Makirere have taken a unique little 18th century building and fitted it out with Irish oak, bespoke ceramics and Irish linen, while maintaining the style of fresh, seasonal food they have long championed. Visit for breakfast, coffee and lunch. JC It’s all about tequila and grilling at Jules Mak’s new Mexican restaurant. The margarita made with Casamigos tequila and avocado syrup is already a signature serve but there are nine others from which to choose. Chef Hector Gutierrez Ochoa turns out bites, hand-pressed tacos and meaty main courses grilled over open fire, including strip loin steak with chimichurri. The atmosphere is buzzy and booking is essential. Read our review here. JC Not everyone loves a communal table, but if you’re heading to Blackrock’s latest by-day cafe, by-night wine bar, you’ll find more intimate options if you book wisely. Delicious, small plates such as line-caught mackerel in ajo blanco are on the evening menu, and the well-chosen wine list means this is the sort of spot where you could easily find yourself lingering. Read our review here. CH Chef Alex Greene became famous due to the Great British Menu, becoming the first chef from Northern Ireland to secure a course at the banquet. Along with close friend and business partner Bronagh McCormick, he has recently reopened The Buck’s Head in Dundrum. The focus is on traditional pub food, done excellently, so expect lobster Thermidor with salad and fries or the de Terra shorthorn burger topped with pulled beef shin. JC With stone walls, timber beams and a coastal vibe, this Greystones spot has Sheerin Wilde (ex-Avalon) managing and Jaco Pretorius (formerly of La Maison) running the kitchen. The fish-led menu also offers steak, chicken and vegetarian dishes, keeping things flexible. Starters are under €15.50, while mains range from €19.50 for moules marinières to €42 for a 16oz Irish Angus T-bone. It’s as good for a quick bite as it is for something special. Read our review here. CH This may be one of Dublin’s smallest restaurants, but the flavours and dishes far exceed its mere physical dimensions. Named in August as Michelin’s Bib of the Month, its buzzy atmosphere fits in perfectly with the recent adoption of Drury Street by the young and fun. Kick-start the evening with “Amy’s Cherry Sgropino”, a mix of sparkling wine, Campari and saffron. JC Chefs Nicole and Bart Pawlukojć, who met while working in Denmark, marked five years in business by giving their sleek Kilkenny daytime spot a complete refurb. Their famous sourdough stars across the a la carte and brunch menus, showing up in sandwiches such as the kimchi chicken grilled cheese. For something heartier, try the not-so-Turkish eggs with Ballon Farm’s perfectly runny fried eggs, served with roasted Mooncoin beetroot and wilted organic greens. CH This Mediterranean seafood joint, with its Italian-heavy focus, has a menu split into spuntini, smalls, larges and desserts, with specials chalked up daily. Fresh morcilla is flambéed tableside in sambuca, and padella di mare, packed with Kilkeel crab claws and Killary Fjord mussels sautéed in a vermouth, comes sizzling in cast iron. Don’t skip the home-made gelato. Read our review here. CH Fish Shop’s charm lies in its confident simplicity. Start with sherry and a gilda, then move on to impeccably cooked fish, perhaps paired with a Jura white from their 200-bottle wine list. With just 15 counter stools, booking ahead is essential. The menu features cockles with chorizo, anchovies on toast, and the best crispy fish and chips in town. Grower Champagne by the glass is an added bonus. CH Owners Gilles Gaillot and Emma Gray have transformed this former bookies into a neighbourhood treasure. The wood-fired oven is in constant service, turning out pastries and breads in the morning, before switching to French-style pizzas in the evening. Loyal customers stop to fill up on lunchtime soup and hearty sandwiches, while young couples linger over pizzas topped with Bayonne ham, merguez sausage and Emmental cheese. JC The bright neon “Saigon” sign mounted on the rear wall gives a good clue as to what’s on offer. Through the open pass, chef Phillip Hughes oversees delivery of the east-Asia-inspired menu, with options such as Crying Tiger marinated Irish beef, classic Pad Thai or red curry with Skeaghanore duck leg, served with elegant cocktails. There’s a well priced lunch menu and a private room upstairs for groups. JC A fixture on the Cork food scene which has recently doubled in size, at Izz Cafe, Izz and Eman Alkarajeh serve up a mixture of mezze-style Palestinian foods and manaeesh-topped flatbreads, with breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Ingredients are sourced from Palestine, or closer to home from the English Market and the Cork Rooftop Garden. Watch out for their Coffee for Palestine fundraiser in conjunction with more than 90 Cork cafes. JC The interiors at Kai are always as seasonal as the food. With windows currently full of beautiful, orange pumpkins and autumnal foliage, dishes such as John Dory with burnt butter cauliflower and fried cob nuts reflect the time of year. Holding the only Michelin Green Star in Ireland, chef and owner Jess Murphy is a firm advocate of farm to fork, and desserts are made by sister business Hapi Bakery. JC Earlier this year, Sham Hanifa released his first cookbook, Agak Agak, a tribute to his heritage which spans China, Thailand, Malaysia and India. Readers will be drawn into his world of deep aromatics and rich flavours, just as if they were sitting in his restaurant, open every day from breakfast to evening. Try classics such as the chicken satay or beef rending. JC Alain Morice’s 20-seater deli, daytime bistro and wine bar blends French charm with Irish produce. The small menu features a weekly pâté en croute, a labour of love, which could be pork, figs and herbs wrapped in crisp, golden pastry. Galway snails swim in garlicky butter and the roast chicken Dauphinoise is pure comfort. Desserts by Morice’s sister finish things off perfectly. Read our review here. CH After five years in business, chef Conor Halpenny briefly closed Square earlier this year to allow time for a recharge and reset, before reopening with a fresh new menu. This restaurant’s joy and love is evident in every dish, from home-made crisps snowed under by cheese, the Square “KFC”, and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese. Look out for wine glasses with a little dog motif, a tribute to Alfie, the restaurant dog. JC With three cafes dotted around Dublin city, Stephen O’Dwyer’s Tang is a popular choice for a healthy, nutritious and joyous lunch. But it’s gone up another level with the arrival of the casual evening menu at Cumberland Place. Home-grown chef Aoibheann’s menu is heavily influenced by flavours of the Middle East, with pillowy focaccia, smoky aubergine dip and halloumi in bright, vibrant harissa yoghurt, all enjoyed with glasses from the short wine list. JC With an open wood grill burning in the heart of the kitchen, and home-brewed beers to accompany their fine steaks, Elbow Lane is a Cork treasure. JC Whether you’re dining in the elaborate main room or on the beautiful terrace, Fire remains one of Dublin’s most popular spots for steak. JC Quality steaks in a casual setting at very pocket friendly prices. JC Given that the Buckley family started as butchers, it’s no surprise that this award-winning group of restaurants serve some of Ireland’s finest steaks. JC This award-winning gastropub knows how to serve up great steaks, paired perfectly with one of their own craft beers. JC Whether it’s the good value rump steak at lunch, or a hearty porterhouse for dinner, enjoy them all in Dublin’s most stunning diningroom. Read our review here. JC Charcoal-grilled Tyrone beef, wine and cocktails make James St the smart choice for steaks in Belfast. JC Enjoy Gilligan’s Farm dry-aged steaks, cooked in a charcoal Josper oven in this busy Galway spot. JC This luxe gastropub in the heart of Cashel serves fine, hearty steaks, best enjoyed with triple-cooked chips and their shallot and Bourguignon sauce. JC With restaurants in Cork and Limerick, the stylish Cornstore serves up premium dry-aged steaks and fun cocktails. JC Kilian Walsh, formerly of L’Enclume, heads the kitchen at this Michelin-starred restaurant. The €105 tasting menu features inventive dishes such as mushroom custard with ox tongue and sweetcorn, and grilled pork with artichoke barigoule. With a strong focus on seasonal Irish produce from Castleruddery Organic Farm, the restaurant caters particularly well to vegetarians and vegans. A recent mini refurb has added new flooring and banquet seating, keeping the space casual but fresh. Read our review here. CH Located a short distance from Belfast, Frae is to be found in the food Mecca that is Holywood. The constantly changing menu from chef Shaun Tinman is always fun and creative, with specials featuring veal scallopine with Gorgonzola butter and sherry sauce, or chargrilled chicken Marbella, drawing flavours from right across the island. Choose from the excellent natural wine list and let the relaxed service set you at ease. JC Grano is one of those Dublin restaurants where reservations are rarer than hen’s teeth. Since it opened in 2018, Roberto Mungo’s handmade pasta has had diners coming back for more. To understand his attitude to quality, consider the fact that he only uses flour made from an ancient grain called Senatore Cappelli that is grown near his Calabrian hometown using low-intervention methods. JC Operating from a small but buzzy space, Niall McDermott and Chloe Kearney have built up a loyal customer base with their short and sharp menus of small plates, fresh pasta and large sharing meats. Plates such as pumpkin cappellacci with sage and walnuts or the pork chop from Pigs on the Green have become signature items. When closed, the duo often make the space available for pop-up and charity events. JC With more than 100 wines from which to choose, the wine list at Note is an homage to biodynamic, natural and low-intervention winemaking. In the kitchen, Essa Fakhry has established a unique style of modern Irish cooking that sometimes dances on the edge of austerity but never disappoints in flavour. Try crab crumpet with sea urchin espuma or roast quail with coco beans and girolles to experience for yourself. Read our review here. JC After two years of quietly shaping the menu, head chef Miguel Frutos is now making Paradiso unmistakably his. The vegetable-led dishes, sourced from Gortnanain Farm, are nothing short of remarkable, and the €68 six-course tasting menu feels like a steal. The wine list, too, stands out for its accessibility. Meanwhile, long-time manager Dave O’Mahony is stepping into ownership alongside Miguel, marking a new chapter for this Cork institution. Read our review here. CH Sometimes it’s easy to overlook the classics in favour of the new, but the Saddle Room at Dublin’s own grande dame hotel remains an excellent choice for relaxed smart dining, whether for lunch or a special occasion. Stop at the seafood bar for some oysters and champagne, or indulge in a magnificent chateaubriand carved table side, all in a cosy cocoon right in the city centre. JC Paul McNamara, Simon Barrett, and Liz Matthews run a Spanish-influenced restaurant where the menu includes dishes such as Cantabrian anchovies, Ibérico pork presa, Coolea agnolotti and brill à la plancha. For two, the salt-aged Delmonico with Béarnaise, beef dripping potatoes, and Bordelaise sauce (€82) is a regular favourite. The 300-bottle wine list covers sherries, Spanish small producers and a strong line-up of grower champagnes. CH The €90, six-course tasting menu at Michelin-starred Variety Jones ranks among the best meals I’ve had this year – no fuss, just superb cooking in a relaxed setting. Chef-patron Keelan Higgs has an obsession with local, organic and seasonal produce, all seared by the intense heat of the open fire. Highlights include oysters dressed in a punchy Vietnamese sauce, duck liver parfait with waffles, a gloriously rich spaghetti Alfredo, and barbecued monkfish. The food manages to be both precise and bold, yet never loses its playful edge. CH This small premises on Kevin Street is from the people behind the Fish Shop in Stoneybatter and the Beach House restaurant in Tramore, Co Waterford, so it should be no surprise that both the food and the wines are superb. Read our review here. CH Nelly’s Café in Drumcondra transforms into Brut Wine Bar on Friday and Saturday evenings, offering small bites and interesting wines. CH From Enda McEvoy of the late, lamented Loam in Galway, Éan is a bakery and casual lunch place that at night becomes a creative restaurant and friendly wine bar, with a great selection of natural and organic wines. CH A long-established food shop and restaurant upstairs, their wine cellar offers 300 different bottles as well as beers and cocktails, and a great selection of food from the Italian-focused menu. CH A wine shop and casual wine bar serving low-intervention wines and light snacks around a friendly communal table. Read our review here. CH With charming sommelier Nick Fajours (previously of Knockranny House) behind this venture, an interesting wine list is no surprise. There’s also plenty of emphasis on cocktails, with old classics and more inventive creations. CH A great addition to the neighbourhood scene in Kimmage, with a menu focused on small snacks and a great selection of wines by the glass. CH A spin-off from Elaine Murphy’s Washerwoman restaurant next door, Little Washer offers pizzas, pasta and small plates, as well as an extensive wine list. CH A coffee shop by day, just opposite the RDS, Mr Magpie turns into a wine bar with small plates on Friday and Saturday nights. CH Here’s a change from all the cafes that turn into wine bars – a bookshop that turns into a wine bar. Thursday through Sunday from 5pm the bar is open, with an interesting variety of sherries and good selection of wines. CH More than 100 wines by the glass (and 250 by the bottle) plus a broad food menu with an emphasis on local seafood. CH On Montague Street in Dublin, this tiny, oh-so-cool space offers coffee, breakfast and lunch, then 40 different wines and sharing plates of food later in the evening. CH The wine list in this Waterford city spot is exceptional – which is hardly surprising, as Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns it. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. Read our review here. CH For those craving a Michelin-starred experience without remortgaging the house, Garrett Byrne and Bríd Hannon’s restaurant offers a lunch and early bird menu at an astonishing €48 for three courses. Dinner, naturally, pushes things a little higher at €78, but what you get in return are dishes rooted in the classics, such as foie gras “crème caramel”, saddle of lamb and roast almond ice cream. CH Mirco Fondrini’s osteria offers a slice of Lombardy right in the heart of town, with pasta and sauces crafted in-house. The menu is pure comfort, with dishes such as home-made tagliatelle with porcini, oven-baked cannelloni stuffed with ragú bianco, and Skeaghanore duck breast paired with braised shallots in agrodolce. Bruno Pangia from Naples now heads the kitchen, and with prices at €39 for starter and main, or €32 for main and dessert, it’s great value for what’s on offer. Read our review here. CH The historic heart of Waterford City is beating strongly once more, and Peter Everett’s modern Irish restaurant is bang in the middle. It occupies the remains of a 15th-century building, a claim few others can match. Everett’s consistently offers excellent value for money, while Waterford and local producers are represented on the menu by the likes of Tuskar crab, Comeragh lamb and Clashganny apples. JC It’s rare for a chef to relinquish a Michelin star but that is exactly what Takashi Miyazaki did when he decided to transform his fine-dining kaiseki restaurant into a more relaxed bistro and natural wine bar serving handmade buckwheat noodles, donburi bowls and tasty snacks. Cork folk rewarded him with even more business, and customer demand has resulted in the launch of dedicated sushi nights. Read our review here. JC With a newly minted Michelin Bib Gourmand, Lottie’s is a solid choice for dinner with pals. If you’re after something quick and casual, the two/three course, €29/€35 early evening menu (Wednesday-Friday from 5pm-6pm) is great value. For a longer evening, the ground-floor terrace (heated and covered) is open for outdoor dining or pre-dinner drinks. Menu highlights include Castledermot lamb with flatbread, Andarl Farm pork chop, and free-range chicken, all cooked over the live fire grill. Read our review here. CH With its €30/€35 early bird menu, Thursday steak nights and solid Sunday roasts, you’d be forgiven for thinking this place is just about neighbourhood comfort food. But behind the scenes, Gareth Naughton is quietly taking things up a level. And things are about to get more interesting with the launch of his intimate 12-seater upstairs, where he’ll be serving a chef’s tasting menu. Read our review here. CH A review of One Pico’s Instagram account will reveal beautiful dishes, plated with elegance and flair. It’s all due to head chef Zhan Sergejev, who combines a background in art and photography with his style of flavourful, modern French cooking. The diningroom remains ever elegant, a lovely spot for lunch or dinner, with a wine list heavily influenced by terroir and organic or biodynamic winemaking. Read our review here. JC Though many places have dropped the early bird menu, this bustling neighbourhood favourite still offers two/three courses for €40/€46 each evening. The menu is anything but ordinary. Starters such as roast beetroot with ricotta, courgette and black olive, or cured mackerel with tomato and smoked eel cream bring a fresh twist. Mains include pan-seared halibut with squid marinière or the indulgent suckling pig loin paired with ham hock, sausage and an Iberico ham doughnut. CH John and Tara Coffey are celebrating 18 years in business, just in time for game season, their favourite time of the year. Over the next few months the menu will feature partridge, venison, mallard, wood pigeon and pheasant, all supplied by Eamon Giblin of Gourmet Game. Their cosy restaurant is truly one of Ireland’s low-key treasures, and well worth a stop when travelling across the country. JC David Devereaux may jokingly say that he is the “worst home cook on the planet” but his food at this lovely Cork city restaurant continues to go from strength to strength. Along with partner Anne Zagar, they now focus on evening service, which is proving hugely popular with Corkonians. Stand-out dishes include confit pork belly with rhubarb and mustard cream, and ricotta and hen’s yolk raviolo in onion broth. JC Daróg, run by Zsolt Lukács (ex-Aniar sommelier) and his wife Edel McMahon, is a wine bar at heart but also a serious restaurant. Attila Galambos (formerly of Aniar and Lignum) seems to really have hit his stride here, with dishes like softshell crab tempura with wasabi emulsion, kingfish crudo with yuzu, and king scallops with Connemara surf clams. There is now an option of a five-course tasting menu (€55), and the wine list is as sharp as the food. Read our review here. CH It’s hard to believe that Dax is celebrating 20 years in business. There’s no shouting from the rooftops or splashy renovations – just Graham Neville serving up some of the best classic French food in Dublin, long before “quiet luxury” was a thing. Olivier Meisonnave’s very fine wine list and impeccable service adds to the sheer joy of dining here. The two/three course lunch menu (€42/€58), is one of the most wonderful escapes on a dreary Friday afternoon, and the three-course dinner (€89) is equally lovely. CH Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have their eyes set on the flavours of autumn at Mamó. Dishes such as rabbit strozzapretti or sika venison with parfait, Roscoff onion and braised leeks are sure to warm the heart and stomach, but rest assured, their signature “cod chip” remains. Set lunch is available on weekdays with a la carte in the evenings. JC There’s a true joy and warmth to be found in Barbara Nealon’s popular restaurant where chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez continues to tempt with specials such as chard with pine nuts, raisins and ajo blanco, or mackerel escabeche with leeks and a jammy egg. The popular “Somewich Sunday”, combining sandwiches and wine, returns soon, as does Provisions, the take-home service of tasty bits and cook-at-home meals. JC Celebrating 10 years in business, The Old Spot has just published a magnificent cookbook which beautifully captures the warmth and friendliness of this cosy gastropub. It’s all about comfort food here, including free-range scotch egg made with Andarl pork and Sneem black pudding, roast chicken supreme with dumplings, and perfect panna cottas. With a great selection of cocktails and drinks, you’ll find it hard to leave. JC This 1820s coach house is exactly where you want to land after a brisk walk in the Wicklow Hills. The kitchen works with suppliers including Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach Organic and Higgins Family Butchers, and the menu has hearty options such as Dundrum Bay crab fazzoletti with heirloom tomatoes, cod and chips, and a rich Wagyu cheeseburger. For something more casual, pop into their next-door sister spot, Roundwood Stores bakery. Read our review here. CH Vaughan’s Pub in Liscannor has been a go-to for more than 40 years, serving up lobster bisque, foie gras, steaks and freshly caught fish alongside a 200-bottle wine list. James Vaughan leads the kitchen here, while his father Denis runs the more laid-back Vaughan’s on the Pier in Lahinch. Seafood is landed daily and the seafood chowder, classic fish and chips, and fresh catches are the stars. CH Chapter One remains the one to beat, not just for its two Michelin stars or the three-course €85 lunch menu, but because it is resolutely one of the best restaurants in the world. Exquisite use of produce and meticulous and detailed cooking mean every morsel, from the first amuse bouche to the petits fours, is likely to be among the best you will ever taste. CH Having joined the ranks of Ireland’s Michelin-starred restaurants this year, D’Olier Street is one of the hottest tickets in town. Book one of the prime seats at the low kitchen counter to watch James Moore and team move smoothly through service, or relax at a table in the sleekly aesthetic diningroom. For the non-drinkers, there’s a creative non-alcoholic cocktail pairing to go with the tasting menu. Read our review here. JC This Cork stalwart has recently undergone a dramatic glow up, shedding its formerly muted tones for a plush floral and green inspired decor that reflects the small courtyard garden. With the English Market nearby, the new menu is firmly anchored by comforting favourites such as seafood chowder made with catch from Ballycotton, beef and Beamish stew and Quigley’s lamb shank. JC The sleek styling, large glass windows and Scandi vibes at Lignum are in strong contrast to Danny Africano’s preferred cooking style over primal fire. The end result, though, is modern and elegant, with dishes retaining just a lingering imprint of the flames. Current specials include Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan and a glorious mixed seafood pasta with red mullet and gambero rosso di Mazara. Read our review here. JC Open for more than 20 years, this fine-dining venue with impeccable hospitality remains one of the top choices for special occasions and chic lunches. The classic French-style cooking is elegant and subtle, with occasional lively touches. Whatever you order, be sure to indulge in the luxurious pomme purée and the wonderful cheese trolley that is wheeled table side. JC The arched vaults of the Bishop’s Buttery, which boasts one of Ireland’s newest Michelin stars, are on the basement level of the beautifully restored Cashel Palace Hotel. The cooking style is classically French, while making extensive use of Tipperary and Irish producers. Look out for an upcoming series of dinners in conjunction with luxury beverage producers including Deutz champagne and Macallan whisky. Read our review here. JC Executive head chef Mark Treacy brings a wealth of experience to Kenmare, having previously worked in Dromoland Castle, Thornton’s and L’Ecrivain. Since taking over in 2022 he has steered this large, elegant diningroom towards modern classics, prepared using seasonal Irish ingredients. Dishes such as ravioli filled with Coolea cheese in onion broth, or cod with mussels, peas and girolles in Vin Jaune sauce are sure to please all comers. JC The Lady Helen at Mount Juliet Estate, now beautifully refurbished to highlight its elegant stuccowork, is a Michelin-starred diningroom led by John Kelly. His French-influenced, eight-course tasting menu (€160) showcases top Irish ingredients with dishes such as Mullaghmore lobster with violet artichoke and bouillabaisse, and Tipperary organic veal with black truffle and aged Comté. Kelly’s cooking is precise and ingredient-driven, perfectly complementing the grandeur of the room. CH Set against stunning views of the Burren, every dish here is crafted with meticulous technique. The €95 menu starts with canapés, including warm miso velouté with smoked eel. Atlantic scallops are sliced, cured and paired with rhubarb, while roast halibut is served with peas and broad beans fresh from the kitchen garden, bathed in butter. Jonathan Farrell, ex-sous chef at Bastible, leads the kitchen with confidence and skill – one of my top predictions for a Michelin star in 2025. Read our review here. CH The Morrisson Room oozes old-world grandeur, complete with Lafranchini stuccowork and a menu that matches the surroundings. Chef Adam Nevin (former head chef at The Dorchester) returned to his native Maynooth in 2023 and has been turning out refined, thoughtful dishes ever since. The dinner tasting menu runs at €110, with a signature menu at €140. Expect plenty of luxury ingredients and tableside theatre. Sunday lunch is a more laid-back affair, with two courses for €55, or three for €65. Closed for the month of January. Read our review here. CH Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. JC There’s a lot of talk about Ballyfin this year, the ultra-expensive hotel where Amal and George Clooney once stayed and Kanye and Kim honeymooned. The Michelin guide awarded the hotel three keys (the equivalent of three stars for hotels) and posted glowing pictures of the food, promptly adding to the speculation that it is primed to land a star. UK chef Richard Picard-Edwards has made no secret of his ambition, and with dishes like pea cream and broad beans with Belgian caviar, Mossfield ravioli in onion consommé and squab pigeon with foie gras and leg ravioli, it may just be the time to pop an email to see if one of those non-resident tables for the €145 tasting menu is available. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. Read our review here. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. Read our review here. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. Read our review here. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF logs $318 million net inflows despite BTC price dip

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the IBIT fund, continues to be a preferred option for financial investors. The fund attracted around $318 million in net inflows on Oct. 31 despite Bitcoin’s price falling 4% to $68,800. The inflow followed IBIT’s record-breaking performance of $875 million on Oct. 30, which exceeded its previous high of $849 million. The fund’s weekly inflows have now surpassed $2 billion, according to Farside Investors data. Valkyrie’s BRRR fund also added nearly $2 million on Thursday. In contrast, other ETF providers faced significant redemptions. Fidelity’s FBTC ended its two-week positive streak with over $75 million in net outflows. ARK Invest/21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale ETFs collectively reported $213 million in outflows. Despite the mixed performance across ETFs, IBIT’s massive influx efficiently helped the US spot Bitcoin ETF group maintain positive momentum, adding over $30 million in new investments. This marks the seventh consecutive day of net inflows for the sector. IBIT has accumulated almost $30 billion in assets since its launch, with approximately half of that amount gathered in the past month. The combined holdings of US spot ETFs have now exceeded 1 million Bitcoin. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT has attracted more investment than any other ETF in the past week, surpassing established funds like VOO, IVV, and AGG, despite launching less than ten months ago. $IBIT took in more cash than any other ETF in the world over the past week. This is out of 13,227 ETFs, which includes $VOO $IVV $AGG etc. It's so hard to beat those veteran Cash Vacuum Cleaners, even for a week, especially for an infant ETF (3mo-1yr old) pic.twitter.com/S443lUXVQk — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Don’t let Gladys and the Loons Win

A couple of weeks ago, on a balmy autumn day, I proudly planted a Trump yard sign in my lawn. My wife was on the porch. Across the way came a shout. “Your husband didn’t make you do that, did he?’ I looked across the way to see our neighborhood’s version of Gladys Kravitz. The decibels suddenly rose. “Trump is gonna take away my rights,” she screeched. “You disappoint me, girl!” My wife smiled, put a hand to her ear, pretending not to hear, pulling a Reagan. Gladys’ hubby scampered out and ushered her into the house. The trauma must have made it a whiskey night for vexed Gladys. No rocks, straight up. Afterwards, we wondered about what rights Gladys feared that Trump would snatch. Gladys is past childbearing age -- unless something biblical happens. She certainly isn’t worried about having access to an abortion clinic -- and what does she have to fear but fear itself in a bluish state? Maybe she doesn’t want grandkids? Or like Bill Gates and every other conscientious Malthusian, maybe she hopes to depopulate the planet? “Manmade” climate change can’t be stopped just by banning plastic straws and curtailing cow flatulence, though those earn gold stars for fine starts. Who doesn’t want to eat bugs instead of a T-bone? Maybe Gladys hopes to transition -- you know, not in a job but in gender. Trump and most Americans could care less. Yes, Rachel “Dick” Levine is weird and, no, embracing your DNA and accepting your biological maleness or femaleness isn’t weird, despite progressives’ relentless attempts to “Twilight Zone” female sports. What Trump and common-sense people are aghast at is mutilating kids’ bodies. Crazy them, but they contend that Frankensteinian science can’t turn a 12-year-old boy into a 12-year-old girl. They claim this is a cruel hoax and must stop. Children, say fab progressive parents and well-paid Manhattan child psychologists, “feel” they’re “misgendered” so they are misgendered. In the Brave New World, bodies -- 100% nature made -- are subordinate to feelings. It’s kinda tabula rasa. Charge critics, it’s a cuckoo’s nest worth of refugees from reality cursing and shaking fists at God. Nature, normies are informed, can and must bend to fickle desires. Let’s not skip the fact that mutilating kids’ bodies is a profit center. When medical center suits sniffed a new revenue stream, well, how hard was it to find surgeons willing to do the cutting? Cha-jing! Maybe Gladys is worried that Trump will take away her right to have her community invaded by opened to illegals migrants? Diversity is strength and all that word salad stuff. It hasn’t happened in Gladys’ neck of the woods yet, but if momala creatively ballots her way into the White House, a new torrent of migrants will wash across red and blue communities everywhere… for four more years. Or longer, because momala and the cabal that employs her will set about fixing our broken election system. Surely honest elections are a right, and Democrats know how to safeguard rights. In January 2021, wizened House Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer unveiled H.R. 1. That comprehensive elections reform measure was cleverly labeled “For the People Act of 2021.” Had Congress passed it, it would have centralized control of elections in Washington, D.C. Gladys’ Democrats claimed that Washington’s control of elections is democracy in action. Concentrations of power ensure our rights. But, finally, why care what the Founders wanted? Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other slaveholders and misogynists -- and egads, lots of other dead white men -- were vile creatures whose statues deserve to be graffitied and sledgehammered. Gladys loves the word “democracy.” It trips off Kamala’s tongue routinely. Democracy means everything to end-stage progressivism and means just about what comrades Stalin and Mao intended: We decide, you submit -- with nice, big smiles on the proletariat’s faces. Vox populi requires that a few extra chairs be added in U.S. Supreme Court. Conservatives disparage that act of democracy as “court packing.” They preach about original intent. Guys like Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, and Neil Gorsuch refuse to eat from FDR’s old crock of stew. A law’s intent is pretty much what’s felt, say the Sotomayors, Kagans, and Brown-Jacksons, whose feminism informs them unerringly. Ouija boards may also help. If you want to figure out what’s on your rights menu, do as Gladys does, tune into MSNBC or CNN daily. Otherwise, shut up, sit down, and be grateful that you haven’t been cancelled into oblivion. Did someone say, “Free speech?” Gladys, like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, is emphatically for free speech -- within proper bounds, of course. The 1st Amendment requires guard rails, lest speech veer into hate speech and misinformation. Yard signs bearing the names of disapproved candidates are on the wrong side of the guard rails. Der Führer Donald Trump and his hordes are reckless with speech. Questioning the governance and policies of the benighted cabal running the Biden-Harris administration is undemocratic. Charging that Uncle Sam has been bound and gagged and stuffed into the U.S. Senate cloakroom by Chuck Schumer, while an imposter, oozing corruption, is paraded, amounts to incitement. ls incitement uttering “Deep State” publicly? What Deep State? And how dare Trump ruffians disparage Chris Wray’s FBI? An East German Stasi Lite? Would the FBI get a spanking new HQ if they were bad boys and bad girls? Who serves as arbiters of good and bad speech? Perhaps bad speech is like porn: elites know it when they see it. Or in Hillary parlance, the village will know it. The village is a collective, more in the Animal Farm mold than Mayberry. Every collective has a vanguard. Hillary, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Susan Rice, the faculties at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia and too many Gladyses to count will arbitrate. What must keep Gladys crawling walls nights is that a monster is on the loose. Hitler’s doppelganger prowls the fruited plain, meaning to whip inflation, boot illegals, round up criminals, and keep the U.S. out of war. The UFC fights Trump attends just don’t stack up to real bloodletting. Democracy has never been more imperiled. Trump has even teamed up with renegade progressive RFK Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again.” How can anyone suspect the efficacy of Covid vaccines and wholesomeness of Cap’n Crunch? No decent soul doubts the CDC and FDA. And how this side of Genghis Khan can the economy prosper without wars? War is peace, and peace is a fascist scheme to help Putin and waylay democracy. What fate would befall Larry Fink and BlackRock without Ukraine to exploit -- err, develop? As BlackRock goes, so goes America. Ask Dick and Liz Cheney about that. To date, the vaunted efforts of Democrats’ lawfare warriors have failed to hurl Trump into a U.S. version of Landsberg prison. A frazzled Gladys is further distraught. Hillary and the gals on The View warned that Hitler rose to power through elections. For Trump, this election looks promising. A nightmare scenario is unfolding. Kamala is closing her campaign thundering about the coming Trump dictatorship. In the waning days of Election 2024, the D.C. establishment is doubtlessly huddling to figure out ways to thwart Trump. Democracy demands responses. Alas, whatever schemes they hatch to save democracy may have to wait until the interregnum. Whatever the conspirators decide will square with Gladys. Meanwhile, Gladys plots. There’s a Trump sign across the street that the world needs to be saved from. J. Robert Smith can be found at X. His handle is @JRobertSmith1. At Gab, @JRobertSmith.

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. MicroStrategy has disclosed its plan to raise $42 billion over the next three years for additional Bitcoin acquisition. This move will boost its Bitcoin Treasury reserve strategy and also enhance BTC yield for its shareholders. The firm also disclosed its new “21/21 Plan,” a move aimed at generating $42 billion in capital, $21 billion in equity, and $21 billion in fixed-income securities in the next three years. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has revealed its plans to remain bullish on Bitcoin. The firm aims to raise $42 billion over the next three years to acquire more BTC tokens. This information came on Wednesday, October 30, as MicroStrategy released its Q3 financial report for 2024. According to the report, the firm aims to generate $42 billion in three years, which aligns with its “21/21 Plan.” This plan will see the company having $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Meanwhile, the firm reported a 5.1% surge in its “BTC yield” for the quarter. It plans to boost its balance sheet and BTC yield for its shareholders in the long run. MicroStrategy, which claims to be a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” noted that the plan to accumulate additional Bitcoin satisfies its treasury reserve strategy. According to MicroStategy’s Q3 report, the firm recorded an 11% increase in the third quarter. The report indicated that MicroStrategy holds a total of 252,220 BTC tokens as of September 30, worth over $16 billion. The firm purchased the coins at an average cost of $39,266 per token. Following its report, MicroStrategy now holds over 1.2% of BTC’s circulating supply. Moreover, it stands as the fifth largest Bitcoin holder after Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, and Grayscale. The firm’s “21/21 Plan” could also trigger significant buying pressure for Bitcoin, with potential explosive rallies. MicroStrategy’s report indicated that it generated about $2.1 billion via equity and debt in the third quarter. Also, the firm cut down its annual interest expenses by $24 million in Q3. Its total revenue amounted to $116.1 million, about $8 million below consensus estimates for the quarter. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s Q3 revenue earnings plummeted to 10.3% compared to the figure for the same quarter last year. The difference is due to the drastic drops in the company’s product licenses and support revenues. MicroStrategy’s net loss for Q3 amounted to $340.2 million, translating to $1.72 per diluted share. Despite the loss, MicroStrategy remains optimistic about the future and is focused on boosting its presence with Bitcoin. It increased its BTC Yield target for its shareholders, projecting between 6% and 10% for 2025 to 2027. Also, the firm disclosed its new equity that offers up to $21 billion. This move forms part of its strategy to accumulate more BTC tokens and boost shareholders’ value. According to data from Google Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, has recorded over a 260% increase YTD. The share trades at $247.31, indicating a 4.23% decline over the past day.

Title: Podcast: Downtown Josh Brown faces his old market takes

Downtown Josh Brown is leaving blogging behind, but wanted to take a look back. He joins us today to talk about his old MarketWatch interviews, his new book, "You Weren't Supposed to See That: Secrets Every Investor Should Know” and what Wu-Tang Clan taught him about business. This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to OnWatch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's one of the busiest times of the year for financial news. We have a wave of big tech earnings, tons of crucial economic data, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, plus a pivotal presidential election. As we wait for the results of some of this news, we wanted to bring on an important voice, Downtown Josh Brown. Known for his Reformed Broker Blog and the Compound Podcast, he joins us today to talk about his new book, The Market, and what the Wu-Tang Clan taught him about running a business. Plus, we'll tell you about the news we're watching this week and how it will impact your wallet. So let's talk to Downtown Josh Brown. Downtown Josh Brown made his name as a blogger, but Brown is pretty much done with that part of his career. And to mark that change, he's published a book called You Weren't Supposed to See That: Secrets Every Investor Should Know. The book retraces some of Brown's most famous market takes and extracts long-term lessons from those blog posts. So in the spirit of that book, I asked Brown to revisit some of the things he's said to MarketWatch over the past decade. Josh, when I met you a couple of years ago, we asked you what you thought you'd be reading on MarketWatch in the next five years, and you said, "I'll be reading a lot about inflation and then eventually disinflation and then maybe deflation, hopefully not. But I do think probably a lot of what will be driving trends in the market will have to do with interest rates and macroeconomic concerns." And reading that back, I have to say, ding, ding, ding, it's been a lot of talk about interest rates and macroeconomic concerns on this podcast this year. So it does seem like you nailed that one. Josh Brown: 100%, and that's exactly how things played out. It's not Nostradamus level vision, it was just very obvious that a lot of what people were being driven by in terms of selecting an asset allocation was as a result of 0% interest rates. And then of course, we had 5% interest rates, and you see people's attitudes toward allocating to these different assets being very different. I think the two most important things in the markets are earnings growth and interest rates. So all of these other things that we discuss feed into those two major variables. The two biggest things that are happening right now is that interest rates are falling and earnings are growing, which is why we're sitting near record highs in the S&P, and the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones in so many sectors of the market. This is the best combination of conditions you could possibly ask for. So if I met a genie and the genie said, "I'll grant one wish. I'll tell you one thing about where things will be a year from now," the only thing I want to know is are earnings going up or down, and is interest rates or inflation up or down? If I know those two things, I pretty much can get the main story and that's the situation we're in right now. Jeremy Owens: The one thing I would wonder about there is the labor market, Josh, and that's something else we talked about a lot back then. I think you actually banged your hand on the table at the time in late 2022 when people were predicting a recession and you said, "If people don't get fired, then it's not a recession." And we're in that situation again where people are predicting a recession for next year, but we're not seeing people get fired yet. Josh Brown: Such a waste of time. The only people predicting recessions are Canadian economists with newsletters. There's nobody who's managing money who's yelling about recessions. What do you do for a living? You seriously think your job is to predict the economy? Think about the narcissism of saying, there are 7 billion people on Earth and I'm going to accurately predict what all of them are doing, so much so that I'm going to give you a macroeconomic forecast for the Earth. Have you taken leave of your mind, sir? So it bothers me that people think investing is this thing where you have to predict the future and then just invest in the right portfolio that'll capitalize on that. We see time and time again, even if you had the news right, you still wouldn't know what to do with your money. The chaos, the madness, the headlines, the clickbait, it's endless. It's not that we don't think bad things can happen. I'm 47-years-old, I've seen the market get cut in half twice. It's that we don't think every rustle in the bushes is 1929. Jeremy Owens: And that's exactly why people have been reading the Reformed Broker for so long, Josh, is that honesty. The book seems to be kind of a look back, but I think what you do find in the book is the ability to say, "Look, I'm talking about a certain thing there, but this is a universal thing that continues to be important if you're looking at the financial markets and here's what you actually need to take from this." Josh Brown: Well, the idea of writing about the markets daily was never about trying to predict the future, or scare people, or write a headline that gets a lot of clicks because blogging is a lot more personal with the audience. You realize that what you're writing is going to get emailed directly into their inbox and that they are forming a relationship with you. So that's very different than doing every twist and turn in the market five days a week at a publication where it's like, "The Fed is too late. Oh no, the Fed was right. Oh no, now they're too late again." If that's what you're doing, it's impersonal and also, daily market commentary doesn't really hold up that much. And one interesting thing, we structured the firm around content creators and we have 10 people who are writing about investing on a regular or semi-regular basis. We don't own any of their content. Every content creator that's with Ritholtz owns their own content. And one of the reasons why that's so important is people are going to do their best work when they feel invested in it, but the other reason is we don't want it. My market commentary from three months ago doesn't mean anything. It's worthless. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and you're talking about your firm there, Ritholtz Wealth Management, when you talk about how it's structured and that everybody has control of their own individual output, it's funny you talk about Wu-Tang a lot. You're obviously a big Wu-Tang fan. It actually reminds me of what the Wu-Tang did with allowing all the individual members to go off and sign their own deals for their own individual music while keeping the Wu-Tang centered in one place. Josh Brown: This is why it stayed together for 30 some odd years because the RZA realized that if he were to be a pig and try to keep everybody signed to him, ultimately that would lead to bad blood and the whole thing would break apart. That insight into human nature was so significant. I have insanely talented people that I get to work with and one of the most important reasons why we've kept it together for the 11 years we've been a firm is because we give creators the ownership of what they want to say. We let them say it. We provide them with a platform, great distribution. Most entrepreneurs in our space don't understand these things. They think they have to have their grip around everything, but they don't understand how much power there is when you empower other people versus when you subjugate people and push their head down to fit under your banner. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Stay with us. Welcome back. Before the break, we discussed what Josh Brown said to us in 2022, but he's been talking to MarketWatch a lot longer than that, so I wanted to get into some of the things he told MarketWatch over the years. The first big interview we did with him was in 2012 when he was still blogging and he was investing in master limited partnerships, or MLPs. Now, if your immediate reaction is what's an MLP? That makes sense to me, I didn't have any idea either. What you need to know is this, an MLP is a way of structuring a real estate or natural resources business, and it often comes with tax benefits and relatively high yields. Back in 2012, Brown was investing some of his clients in an ETF that included MLPs, and I wanted to know what's changed since then. Well, Josh, the first big MarketWatch interview I could find with you was by Jonathan Burton, and that one is called Five Money Moves a Reformed Broker is Making Now. So in April 2012, what you told us was lean on value in dividends, look at financial stocks in mid-caps, and then believe in bonds, which was an interesting case to make in 2012 that looks a lot better now. The one interesting outlier there is you were talking a lot about master limited partnership ETFs. What happened to those and what do you take from all that you told us in your first big interview with MarketWatch? Josh Brown: So this is prior to the founding of our firm and we had left master limited partnerships behind when we created the new firm and really wanted to do our own thing. With master limited partnerships, you very quickly can ascertain yes, these have high yields, and the pitch is that they aren't as volatile as oil stocks until oil stocks get extremely volatile and then you realize it's like okay, I'm getting this high yield, but I'm also getting the volatility of the energy market. What if instead of prioritizing the yield, I prioritize diversification with an energy? And by the way, I'm not the only person to have had that realization. Most of the large cap MLPs have since converted to C corps, and the asset class has eaten itself. So reducing things along the way has really been the secret, not adding new things all the time just because there's a great sales pitch or story attached to them. A lot of people want to add new things to it and new bells and new whistles. I've always thought of investing as a reductive process when done correctly. It's not that there should never be anything new, it's that the hurdle should be much higher to add something, rather than subtract something. Jeremy Owens: So fast forwarding to 2015, Josh, you talked to us about a robo-advisor service you were developing at Ritholtz called Liftoff. Is that still a part of what you're doing? Josh Brown: It's not a thing anymore. We don't call it a robo-advisor. Liftoff still exists. We've got about $45 million on the platform, couple of hundred households. Most of those households have only a few thousand dollars in their accounts. Some of them have gone on to become multi-million dollar relationships, and they just happen to have started with us on the Liftoff platform. But we don't call it robo because we have human certified financial planners who are actually talking to these clients. Jeremy Owens: Right. Instead of marketing as a robo-advisor, it's your entry tier. It's the way people get into your shop and then you try to move them up. Josh Brown: I always thought of robo as pejorative, and I wrote a post recently. Rich people don't talk to robots. There's nothing wrong with automation, there's nothing wrong with AI. All of these tools are going to be really useful and they're going to help people like me scale our practices. So we now have a tier for every class of investor, if you will. Liftoff is $0 to $250,000. It's our entry level asset allocation/financial planning program, and it's perfect for people that are early in their accumulation. 250,000 to a million is called Good Advice. This is a different robo-advisor service that we actually acquired from BlackRock last year. This is where we're effectively working with HENRYs. These are high earners, not rich yet. Once those people are with us for long enough, they will ultimately become a million to $7 million, which is our Ritholtz Grand tier. Most of our clients are in this range. This is full service wealth management. 7 to 25 million is called The Preserve. These are now families where not only are we managing money for their own retirements, but we now have to think about the next generation and the generation after that because of that level of wealth. And then anything above 25 million is our newly formed Multifamily Office where we basically are doing everything from working directly with estate planning attorneys to handling taxes and even bill pay if that's what a family's looking for. So we have set up these tiers so that we don't have to say no to anyone, and we could be really proud of the level of service that we're delivering appropriately for each group. But to say to a client, "You're not important enough to talk to us, talk to our software," I don't like the spirit of it, so we don't do it. Jeremy Owens: Well, that's one of the ways y'all are different, and we did try to hone in on your differences. In 2020, you wrote a big long feature about what you were doing called Downtown Josh Brown's Budding Media Empire Seeks to Upend Traditional Wealth Management, and I really jumped at one of the quotes from that feature. You said, "I love to have a conversation with a client if they want my opinion on Google's latest quarter or whatever, but it's not going to help them. It's fun to talk about, but what's really going to help them is establishing a plan and sticking to it." And Josh, this is something I struggle with on a daily basis. As a financial journalist, I love talking about the latest earnings and all the latest news, but honestly, it probably shouldn't affect what listeners are doing with their financial situation. You should be setting up your finances for the long term in a way that the latest news isn't going to affect you, and that's what you were saying about how you work with your clients. Josh Brown: Yeah, that's right. One of the things that we've done really effectively is jujitsu the conversation. A lot of people come to us, they hear Barry on Bloomberg Radio, they see me on TV. Then of course, the first thing they want to talk about is portfolio holdings, or should I buy Coke or Pepsi into the earnings, or what's better, Microsoft or Apple? If we're going to be effective, we have to change the conversation to tell us what's going on with you because we already know none of that stuff really is going to help anybody. You might be able to put on a great trade or something, but what people really need and what people want to talk about at first are not always the same thing, what are the things that you want to spend money on today, tomorrow, and 10 years from now and 50 years from now? What are those important things to you? And they can change, but right now, what are they going to cost and what are contingencies? Right now, you own a business. You might still own that business in 15 years, or somebody might call you in three years and say, "I'm buying it." How dependent do you think your adult children are going to be on you when they're 22? What about when they're 32? Where do you want to live? What do you want to do for vacations? You got to have conversations about that so that you can reverse engineer the right portfolio. And then when you're having the portfolio conversation, the repeated reminder has to be look, this is not about feeling smart when you flip on CNBC and the oil stock you own is outperforming the other oil stocks. If that's what we're doing here, you're talking to the wrong people. This has to be about getting you financially to these goals that you said were important to you. And once that sinks in, finally, finally, you're really helping people. Jeremy Owens: Well, don't convince them to just cut off all financial news, Josh, but I do appreciate... And we try to do the same thing of trying to convince people that a lot of what we talk about is fun to talk about and interesting to talk about, but don't let it change. Josh Brown: For market nerds, listen, there's a subset of people who eat, sleep and breathe this stuff, and I'm part of that, but the thing is to compartmentalize and to say, "Wow, this is really interesting that the ETF market just hit 10 trillion, or that China is doing its first stimulus since pre-pandemic." All of it is fascinating and everyone should be aware of it. The next step, though, do I need to react to it? Our job is to explain to people that no, they don't. Jeremy Owens: Well, Josh, it's been fun revisiting all your discussions with MarketWatch and having yet another one. We look forward to what you can talk to us about in the future. Thanks so much for joining us. Josh Brown: Shout out to MarketWatch. You know I love you guys. Keep doing what you do. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for What We Are Watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. First, economic data. Gross domestic product or GDP, one of the most crucial gauges we have on the growth of our economy, increased 2.8% in the third quarter. Now, that's a really strong reading, economists said. Even though a large trade deficit caused the number to misestimate slightly. Economist Claudia Sahm, who spoke with OnWatch recently, said the report really was good news. But that is far from the only report we'll be watching this week. The October jobs report is coming Friday, and it's an important one. Check marketwatch.com for live coverage. And then there's AI and tech earnings where results have been choppier. On the good side, there's Google, which saw a big increase in cloud revenue as customers rent AI capable workloads. Chief Executive, Sundar Pichai, said that a quarter of all coding at Google is now being performed by AI, but the weight of big expectations is being felt by others, like AMD. The NVIDIA rival posted record revenue and forecast another record quarter, but it wasn't enough for investors who were expecting a bigger guide for the fourth quarter. Shares were pounded Wednesday. In addition, Apple's AI features, Apple Intelligence, debuted with some negative reviews around the internet this week. Apple will report earnings this afternoon, along with Amazon, and we'll be back next week to discuss all we learned about big tech. And a bit of news about the show, with a thanks to you, this podcast won a gold medal for Best New Podcast from the Signal Awards this week. We really appreciate all our listeners who voted for us and everyone who checks in with us every week. And that's it for this episode.

The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn't just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It's made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. "What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner," BlackRock's Rachel Aguirre told CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday. Aguirre, the firm's head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF's mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – "whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500]." The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500. On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That's equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% "It's important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win," Aguirre said. "There's also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it's actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations." The iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF is down 2% since its Oct. 23 launch. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: JD Vance to Joe Rogan: Amnesty Will End Democracy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/10/31/jd-vance-to-joe-rogan-amnesty-will-end-democracy/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T22:12:39Z
Full Content:
An establishment amnesty for the roughly 25 million illegal migrants in the United States would “end democracy,” and convert the U.S. into a one-party state like California, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s hand-picked running mate, told host Joe Rogan on Thursday. “I’m a Reagan guy, right?” Vance said in his three-hour interview with Joe Rogan, adding: I’m a conservative Republican. But [President Ronald] Reagan screwed up a lot … People don’t talk nearly enough about the amnesty thing … Because of what Ronald Reagan did in the 1986 amnesty, California is now effectively a permanently blue state. “The entire country becomes that” if Democrats push through an amnesty, Vance added. But mass migration imposes huge costs on Americans, even without an amnesty, he said. Even when migrants do not hold citizenship, they get a share of representation in Congress, Vance said: For example, the state of Ohio lost a congressional seat in the last census [in 2020 so] states that have high illegal immigrant populations picked up congressional seats. So you’re actually taking away congressional representation from American citizens and giving it to illegal aliens. Even if you don’t give them the right to vote, you’re still destroying the voting power [of citizens]. Immigration also imposes massive civic and economic burdens on Americans’ communities, Vance said: You see this in some communities — because they’re small towns, and because rapid migrant influxes can happen very quickly — here the town population has been doubled. You don’t even have to assume people are criminals …[but] what does it do to the local public school when all of a sudden 1,000 [migrants] show up that don’t even speak English, right? What does it do to the [town’s] hospital system when you now have thousands of people … that are showing up to get emergency services because they don’t have access otherwise to a doctor, and now the American citizens have to wait in line for seven hours to get to see a doctor because we’ve overwhelmed the local hospital system? What does it do to housing prices? We’ve seen this in a number of communities, including those that I represent in Ohio. When you bring in thousands and thousands of people, you cannot build enough houses quickly enough to accommodate that. So the cost of housing becomes unaffordable for American citizens. Those costs are largely ignored by the national media, which mostly hire pro-migration reporters– including many immigrants — to cover migration dramas. “It is the craziest thing that we’ve seen in this country that you don’t even allow people to talk about the effects of mass migration anymore,” Vance said, adding: One of the reasons why Donald Trump is going to be elected president, or at least should be elected president, [is] because he is one of the few guys who’s saying, “You know what, we’re going to talk about this problem. Yes, some immigrants are good [and] some immigrants are not good.” That is an obvious insight to anybody who knows human nature. But it is money that drives the nation’s migration policy, Vance said. “I think what is obvious, and I’ve seen this in the halls of Congress,” he said, adding: I’ve seen it very explicitly. You talk about lobbying [in other political issues], and we obviously talked about [it] in the context of other industries. There is a massive corporate lobby for cheap labor in the United States of America. That is, I think, the main thing that’s going on. Let me tell you a story when I was in the private sector. I was at a business conference dinner, and I was seated next to the CEO of one of the largest hotel chains in America … The guy was going on and on about how much he hates Donald Trump. And I’m like, “Oh, that’s interesting, why do you hate Donald Trump so much?” Because, again, I was, I was sort of a Trump skeptic in 2015 and at this point, I was kind of starting to really get on the Trump train. And he said, “Well, the reason I hate Donald Trump … is because Donald Trump’s border policies have cut down the number of illegal immigrants. And because I can’t pay illegal immigrants under the table anymore, I have to pay American workers, and they want much higher wages.” I was like, “Holy shit! This guy just admitted what is straight-up, Monopoly Man evil shit. My wife, who’s very apolitical, was actually at the dinner with me, and she’s like, “Come again, you just said you don’t want Americans to get decent wages?” The best argument for Donald Trump’s immigration policy is that American workers are getting higher wages, and this is why this corporate CEO hates it. So whatever the industry is, you’ve got a lot of people who want cheap labor and they don’t want to pay American workers higher wages. That’s a big part of it. But Democrats also want to get political advantage from the inflow of poor migrants, Vance added: I do think there’s also a power dynamic to it. In particular, I think Kamala Harris and the Democrats, they want to give these millions upon millions of illegal aliens the right to vote. They want to legalize them. They want to make it easier for them to participate in our elections. And that means, fundamentally, the end of American democracy, because you’re talking about 25 million [illegal migrant] people here. If Kamala Harris gives 10 million of those people legal status and allows them to vote in American elections. Then, say, 70/30 they go [vote] Democrat, Republicans will never win a national election in this country in my lifetime. “It will have degraded the voting power of the people who have the legal right to be here,” he added. Breitbart News has closely tracked the impact of migration on Americans’ blue-collar and white-collar wages, their housing, and, increasingly, on Americans’ productivity. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Overall, since about 1990, the US. government has used an economic policy of Extraction Migration from poor countries to inflate the nation’s consumer economy with extra workers, consumers, and renters. That economic policy has helped grow the economy Congress helped investors to export much of the nation’s manufacturing economy to lower-wage countries.

And both are poised to continue seeing gains in the weeks to come thanks to geopolitical uncertainty, worries over the strength of the dollar, and the upcoming U.S. election, according to JP Morgan analysts. In a Thursday report, analysts at the bank said that a “debasement trade” is coming—which could further drive demand for both gold and Bitcoin and help push up prices. A Donald Trump victory next week in the U.S. presidential election increases the likelihood of such a trade, JP Morgan analysts said. A “debasement trade” is when traders try to hedge against weakening currencies, geopolitical headwinds, and government deficits. Gold is typically a good insurance policy against weakened fiat money; top asset manager BlackRock has also touted Bitcoin—so-called digital gold—as another asset to invest in during times of uncertainty. “Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the ‘debasement trade’ thus favoring both gold and Bitcoin,” the report read. Republican nominee Donald Trump not only has come out as the crypto-friendly candidate in the race, but his policy to increase tariffs could lead to more inflation and geopolitical tensions, the report noted. Ex-President Donald Trump used to be anti-crypto but has come out fiercely in favor of the industry this year. The real estate mogul said he wants all future Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. and also launched a decentralized finance (DeFi) project running on Ethereum that plans to release its own stablecoin, Decrypt previously reported. Gold has this year hit new highs and Bitcoin is now just 5% off touching its March all-time high. The biggest digital coin is trading for $70,114, CoinGecko data shows, after nearly setting a new all-time high on Tuesday.

Business FILE PHOTO: People are seen in front of a showroom that hosts BlackRock in Davos, Switzerland Januar 22, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo BlackRock Inc. on Wednesday filed an application with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission seeking approval to create exchange-traded fund classes for its mutual funds. The asset management giant is the latest and by far the largest among more than 30 money managers that have made similar requests since a patent on the ETF share class structure held by Vanguard expired in May 2023. The SEC does not have a deadline to rule on those applications, and the agency so far has only allowed Vanguard to offer both exchange-traded shares and traditional units within the same mutual fund. Cboe Global Markets is hoping to push the SEC into ruling on the question, by seeking approval for a rule change that would permit it to list and trade ETF share classes. Regulators must respond to such rule-change requests within 240 days, which would fall toward the end of 2024. Dimensional Fund Advisors, one of the first funds to file for permission to offer its existing mutual funds in an ETF format last year, said it has so far received letters of support from several hundred financial advisers who collectively manage $3 trillion in investor assets.

Title: Bitcoin’s White Paper Turns 16: How BTC Went From An Abstract Idea To A Household Name On Wall Street

As you may already know, late October 2008 was an extremely ugly time in the world of finance and money. Most famously, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, and the global economy was teetering into recession. Governments and central banks were scrambling to contain the cataclysm. On Oct. 31, 2008, the Bitcoin white paper came out — now 16 years ago to the day. “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,” pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto famously stated in the opening sentence while sharing the groundbreaking Bitcoin white paper with a cryptography mailing list before linking the document entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The document described the concept of the decentralized P2P cash, which Satoshi called Bitcoin (BTC). 16 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin's Whitepaper and the rest is history. pic.twitter.com/ilprfjzikW On Thursday, the foremost crypto slid below the $71,000 mark, now trading 4% below the current all-time high of $73,737 it reached in March 2024. Still, Bitcoin’s current value is well above the fraction of a penny where it first started trading — and its ardent believers who invested early are insanely wealthy because of it. In the early days, mainstream media painted Bitcoin as just a tool for criminals to launder funds, sell drugs, and conduct other nefarious activities. However, that narrative has continued to evolve. Bitcoin is now increasingly being adopted around the world by nation-states such as El Salvador, which adopted BTC as a legal tender in September 2021. Wall Street titans, including BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager) and its peers, have since launched easy-to-trade spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which have brought in a flood of investment into the apex crypto. These ETFs recently smashed the 1 million BTC holdings milestone, further underscoring Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital asset to a major financial asset. The Wall Street stockpile has grown by $24 billion worth of inflows since the products went live in January while nibbling away at the heels of Bitcoin’s founding father. Perhaps the most confounding thing about Bitcoin is its creator. Satoshi Nakamoto vanished completely from the internet in 2011 after releasing Bitcoin’s founding white paper a decade ago on Halloween in 2008. The conspiracy theories and clues as to who Satoshi really is are endless. For instance, an HBO documentary recently claimed that the elusive crypto creator was early Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who has since refuted the claims — and many crypto community members have also criticized the film. Now, a British-Asian macroeconomist named Stephen Mollah, claimed that he is Satoshi at a London event Thursday. One way that Mollah can prove he is indeed Satoshi is by moving the BTC from the Genesis block. However, he said today that he would do that later. “Genesis block Bitcoin cannot be moved as simply as you think,” Mollah told a BBC journalist in the audience. “It can be moved, but I need to prepare for it. I’ll do it. Very soon.” The identity of Bitcoin’s creator continues to be one of the greatest mysteries in modern finance. For some Bitcoiners, however, the world is better off not knowing who he, she, or they were or is.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/10/31/the-philosophy-of-volatility-7/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T18:38:52Z

ERIC KIM Podcast A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM Podcast Video Audio A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever.

It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital.

If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility ￼

Time Published: 2024-10-31T18:23:45Z
Full Content:
ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion.

And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, Likes to give fellatio to Carl Marx, is a fake woke plant based hippie, spent too much time on Reddit, and pirate Bay, spent too much time quarantine Maria Ozawa pornography, maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and the watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private.

ERIC KIM As of recent updates, MicroStrategy and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hold significant Bitcoin reserves, although their rankings have fluctuated over time. MicroStrategy currently holds approximately 205,000 BTC, valued over $14 billion given recent price surges. BlackRock’s IBIT, launched in early 2024, quickly accumulated around 198,000 BTC, positioning it as a close competitor to MicroStrategy’s holdings. This competitive dynamic underscores a shift in the institutional approach to Bitcoin, with ETFs like IBIT offering a regulated, mainstream option for investors, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to expand their direct holdings. This highlights the growing adoption of Bitcoin in traditional financial products, pushing more institutions toward cryptocurrency exposure through structured financial instruments. For further details on recent acquisitions and strategy shifts, see sources like The Block and ETF.com. .. BlackRock recently expanded its investment in MicroStrategy, holding approximately 1.02 million shares, which accounts for a 7.5% stake as of early 2024. This marks a notable increase from their previous position, representing a significant institutional endorsement of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy. MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor, has strategically accumulated large Bitcoin reserves, which have appreciated significantly as Bitcoin’s institutional appeal grows. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) launched in early 2024 and has grown rapidly, surpassing MicroStrategy in Bitcoin holdings, with 196,088 BTC compared to MicroStrategy’s 193,000 BTC. This dynamic between MicroStrategy’s direct Bitcoin holdings and BlackRock’s ETF signals a shifting landscape, where institutional Bitcoin investments are increasingly facilitated through regulated products like ETFs. The competition underscores the increasing role of major financial institutions in the cryptocurrency space and the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an institutional asset .

Spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $893 million Wednesday, per data from Farside Investors, pushing the funds' collective Bitcoin holdings to over 1 million BTC. The Wall Street trove has grown by $24.2 billion worth of inflows since the products were approved in January, while nipping away at the heels of crypto’s founding father. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who vanished from the internet in 2011, still holds a whopping 1.1 million Bitcoin worth $79 billion at present. At the current rate that spot Bitcoin ETFs are sucking up coins, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated that the crypto pioneer could be overtaken by the group of eleven Wall Street products in terms of holdings soon. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks,” Balchunas wrote on Twitter (aka X) Wednesday. He noted the “Joey Chestnut-level pace” that ETFs are eating up Bitcoin’s supply, referencing the champion competitive eater. The milestone was reached just short of the 16th anniversary for Bitcoin’s white paper. On Halloween in 2008, Bitcoin’s creator laid the blueprint for his now-preeminent “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” publishing his nine-page thesis for Bitcoin’s design online. As Bitcoin tests an all-time high price of $73,737, set back in March, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had two of their best days on record. Representing spot Bitcoin ETFs’ fourth best day of inflows, $870 million worth of allocations on Tuesday were followed by Wednesday’s jump to $893 million. According to Bitwise Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen, institutional investors are leading the charge. While a first wave of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs was driven by retail investors, wealth managers making investments on behalf of clients are currently catching up. Large institutions like Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo have lengthy due diligence and compliance processes, alongside investment committees that vet new types of investments a few times a year, he said. Those companies are now “unlocking their wealth managers,” Rasmussen said. “Even after ETFs make it through those different committees, [institutions] go through a process of educating their advisors on how to talk to clients about Bitcoin or new assets,” he added. “We saw signs of the second wave entering the market earlier this week.” Wednesday’s avalanche of allocations included a high watermark for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Some $872 million worth of Bitcoin flowed into the product Wednesday, per data from Farside, topping the asset manager’s previous daily peak of $849 million from March. Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF saw the second-largest inflows Wednesday at just $12.6 million, while Bitwise's BITB was the biggest loser with almost $24 million in outflows. BlackRock’s stunning Wednesday performance brought its ETF’s Bitcoin holdings to around 429,000, towering over the world’s largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, at 252,000 BTC. While MicroStrategy, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin development company, has institutional investors holding its shares, Rasmussen said that the BlackRock brand has ultimately proved more palatable among Wall Street’s wealth management crowd. “They trust BlackRock,” he said. “They can say, ‘Look, the largest institution in the world is backing Bitcoin in a big way,’ and so it's no longer this contrarian view in the way that it was.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Abu Dhabi firms to launch tokenized US Treasuries fund
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/abu-dhabi-firms-launch-tokenized-us-treasuries-fund-4715786
Time Published: 2024-10-31T13:20:00Z
Full Content:
Business NEW YORK :Abu Dhabi firms Realize and Neovision Wealth Management have launched an investment vehicle that will buy units of exchange traded funds (ETFs) focused on U.S. Treasury bills and convert these assets into digital tokens that can be held, traded and transferred on a blockchain. The fund is called Realize T-BILLS Fund and it will buy BlackRock's iShares and State Street's SPDR, tokenize units from these ETFs, and incorporate them within the fund, Dominik Schiener, co-founder of technology company Realize, told Reuters in an interview. It hopes to grow to a $200-million fund. Realize will tokenize the units of the T-BILLS Fund, while Neovision will manage it. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Tokenized Treasuries are a growing segment of the crypto market, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum, according to data platform rwa.xyz. They are effectively digital tokens created on a blockchain and backed by U.S. government debt, and issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions, notably BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum blockchain, investing 100 per cent of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements or repos. The BlackRock fund has a current market cap of $530 million. FUND DETAILS The Realize fund, the first tokenized fund to be domiciled out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, will issue the $RBILL token and will serve as the digital representation of the units of the fund. They will initially launch on both the IOTA and Ethereum blockchain networks. KEY QUOTES "The goal is to bring fungible assets onchain. T-Bills are the most liquid asset today in the real world," said Schiener. "They're also the best form of collateral, paying around 5 per cent." Dr. Ryan Lemand, co-founder and chief executive officer of Neovision, said it makes sense to buy T-Bill ETFs and tokenize them, instead of outright purchasing Treasury bills in the market. He noted buying cash Treasuries in the market would involve continuous transaction costs because they will have to be bought again and again.

Title: Race For Spot Solana ETF Heats Up As Yet Another Firm Files Application With SEC
URL: https://zycrypto.com/race-for-spot-solana-etf-heats-up-as-yet-another-firm-files-application-with-sec/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T13:09:35Z
Full Content:
Canary Capital Group, a new digital asset-focused investment firm created by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, has become the latest investment firm to apply for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Canary Capital joins a growing list of prestigious asset managers seeking to list a SOL ETF in the United States, including VanEck and 21Shares. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) ETF leader Blackrock opting out of the Solana ETF race, some other firms are not shying away from filing to introduce an investment vehicle that would give investors exposure to SOL without having to purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. According to an S-1 registration statement filed on Oct. 30, Canary Capital’s proposed spot SOL ETF would let traditional investors access the Solana market via brokerage accounts without the potential hurdles to entry or risks. It’s worth mentioning that Canary Capital recently submitted S-1s for a spot XRP ETF on Oct. 8 and then a spot Litecoin ETF just seven days later on Oct. 15. With its latest filing, the firm has not named the custodian and administrator for the SOL ETF, nor did it say what ticker symbol the fund would be listed under. SOL is currently the fifth-largest crypto on the market. The Solana blockchain is used for decentralized applications (dapps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and is home to a slew of meme coins. It’s considered a key competitor to Ethereum as it offers cost-effective and faster transactions. “Despite the hyper-competitive L1 and EVM landscape, Solana has emerged as a battle-tested front-runner for decentralized applications,” Canary wrote in the statement. “Solana’s robust DeFi ecosystem has led to strong sustained on-chain analytics as measured by transactions per day, active addresses, and new addresses, while maintaining a low fee environment for all consumers. Future growth in native on-chain stablecoin deployment will also likely further accelerate the commanding lead Solana maintains over its peers.” Solana has been considered the next digital asset to have a spot ETF greenlighted by the SEC, following Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals in January and July, respectively. Solana ETF anticipation has spurred huge investor attention since VanEck submitted paperwork to launch the VanEck Solana Trust in June 2024. 21Shares followed VanEck’s lead, filing with the SEC to debut its own spot Solana ETF. Asset manager Grayscale recently filed to convert a multi-asset fund into an ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, which features Solana exposure alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, and Avalanche. These filings suggest a rising confidence in Solana’s potential among institutional investors. Franklin Templeton is also eyeing a spot SOL ETF, though it has yet to file an application. In the SEC’s pending lawsuits against digital asset exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the agency claims that SOL satisfies the Howey Test, thus making it a security. Some industry insiders now think SOL ETFs have a near-zero chance of approval due to the SEC’s concerns over Solana’s classification as a security. However, others believe that with BTC and ETH ETFs already trading on U.S. exchanges, making a logical case to deny Solana the same product is a steep uphill battle for the regulator.

The bitcoin price has touched its all-time high of just under $74,000 per bitcoin as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk declares a "financial emergency" that some think will send the bitcoin price even higher. Now, as the Federal Reserve grapples with a "nightmare" scenario, Larry Fink, the chief executive of the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, has warned he doesn't think the Fed is going to cut rates at the pace expected by markets. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, helping the bitcoin ... [+] price to soar as the Federal Reserve grapples with inflation. "We're not going to see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink, who oversees BlackRock's $10 trillion in assets, said during a Bloomberg panel that was part of Saudi Arabia’s annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. Fink predicted just one Fed interest rate cut before 2025 against market expectations of two. "I think it’s fair to say we’re going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen," Fink warned. Last month, the Fed surprised traders with a 50 basis point cut to interest rates, kicking off a reduction cycle after interest rates were ramped up at a historical clip as lockdown-induced inflation threatened to spiral out of control. Expectations that interest rates will come down sharply this year have fueled a bitcoin price boom through 2024, with bitcoin and the wider crypto market bouncing back along with stock markets. Sky-high interest rates have pushed up payments on the $35 trillion U.S. debt pile, with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk last week warning "the interest payments on the debt are 23% of all federal tax revenue" and declaring the situation a "financial emergency." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged to its all-time high of around $73,000 per bitcoin, helped by ... [+] expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has predicted the Fed will allow inflation to run hotter than it has previously to escape its "tremendous debt crisis"—with the bitcoin price soaring as a result. "There's a lot of people who think that the U.S. is about to enter into this tremendous debt crisis. And I believe that we're going to solve ... that and we're going to stop that from happening," Scaramucci told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Scaramucci said he expects the bitcoin price to hit $170,000 by mid-2026, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $3.3 trillion, due to bitcoin's "fixed limited supply, and what I think is very high demand." That demand has been boosted this year by the long-awaited arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wall Street, led by BlackRock's bitcoin fund. On Wednesday, BlackRock's bitcoin ETF saw $872 million worth of net inflows, marking the fund’s largest inflow since its January launch and surpassing the previous record high on March 12. "The recent surge in BlackRock’s IBIT inflows is driven by several key factors, including central banks’ global shift towards reducing interest rates, which has boosted liquidity and made capital more accessible for investors," Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst of BTCMarkets, told The Block.

Vincent Phelan, the 98-year-old Dubliner who campaigned for the liberation of his son Bernard when Bernard was arbitrarily imprisoned in Iran, has died. Mr Phelan’s son Bernard was released from a six and-a-half year jail sentence in Iran in May this year, after an international campaign for his release spearheaded by his father Vincent, and assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Paris-based tourism consultant had been arrested in Mashhad in northeastern Iran and had been charged with offences related to sending information to a foreign state, which he denied. He suffered poor physical and mental health while in prison but in response to his father’s plea, he gave up a hunger strike. [ ‘I’ve enjoyed having a pint of Guinness, seeing family and friends, and Irish humour’Opens in new window ] Vincent Phelan lived to see his son go on to write a bestselling book, You Will Die in Prison (Ériu), which is named after a comment made by an Iranian Judge when Bernard refused to sign papers written in Persian, while in prison. Bernard and Vincent were received by President Michael D. Higgins at Áras an Uachtarain earlier this year. Vincent Phelan died on Wednesday at Belmont Nursing home in Stillorgan. He had previously lived with his wife and three children in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. He was predeceased by his wife Anne and son Declan and survived by Bernard and his daughter Caroline, as well as grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
