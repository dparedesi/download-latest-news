Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Experiences Sixth Day of Outflows Amid US Elections

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now seen six days of net outflows since its launch in January. This means more money has been withdrawn than those added on those days. On November 5, US election day, institutional investors seemed to play it safe, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recording $44.2 million in net outflows, according to CoinGlass data. This outflow marked IBIT’s sixth negative flow since its launch in January. The last outflow was on October 10, when $10.8 million exited the fund. Altogether, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw 116.8 million in net outflows. The largest outflow was from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which saw $68.2 million taken out. The only fund with new inflow for the day was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which had $19.3 million added to it. This marked the third consecutive day of net outflows for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The previous day, November 4, the 11 Bitcoin funds had their second-biggest outflow ever, with over $541.1 million withdrawn. After the US trading day ended, the spot crypto markets saw a big surge. This happened as election results started coming in, with Bitcoin price reaching a new all-time high of $75,000. Henrik Anderson, the chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto, explained that Bitcoin has become a key focus for traders worldwide. He called it the “election trade,” meaning that many investors are now looking to Bitcoin during the election period, hoping for gains. He looked at betting markets and traditional sources to estimate the chances of Donald Trump winning. Based on this information, Henrik figured there was an 80% to 90% chance that Trump would win. Henrik also said that Bitcoin seems to be following this trend. Bitcoin is already above $74,000, and he believes it may have already made most of its price move for now. If Trump wins, he predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This is based on the idea that Trump’s victory would continue to boost Bitcoin’s price. In a blog post, Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store, shared his thoughts on how elections affect investments. He said that people often exaggerate how much elections impact the market. He pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership plays a much more significant role. The SEC is responsible for making investment rules and regulations, which often impact market sentiment. Geraci believes that the regulatory environment, especially those who lead the SEC, can significantly affect ETFs’ development and innovation. The SEC’s decision can either help or slow down new ideas in the ETF market. He also mentioned that no one knows what will happen with the situation. There are many unknowns, and it’s hard to predict the exact outcome. However, Geraci believes the best long-term solution would be to create a clear and balanced set of rules for crypto. This would require cooperation between the two major political parties to develop a framework that works for everyone. Still, he thinks it’s very likely that the results of this election will impact how quickly new crypto ETFs are developed.

Title: After Trump Win, Bernie Sanders Blames Democrats for Abandoning Working People
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/bernie-sanders-shawn-fain-democrats-trump
Time Published: 2024-11-07T03:55:00Z
Full Content:
Shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders forcefully called out Democratic Party leadership for losing The White House and at least one chamber of Congress to Republicans. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. ​“First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well.” “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,” said the senator, who decisively won reelection on Tuesday as Republicans reclaimed the upper chamber. ​“And they’re right.” After seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, Sanders spent this cycle campaigning for Harris, warning of Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s return, blasting billionaire involvement in U.S. politics, and urging Democrats to better serve working people. In Sanders’ new statement, he highlighted U.S. income and wealth inequality, worker concerns about artificial intelligence, and the federal government’s failure to provide paid leave and universal healthcare while pouring billions of dollars into Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. “Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful oligarchy which has so much economic and political power?” he asked. ​“Probably not.”​“In the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions,” Sanders concluded. ​“Stay tuned.” Progressives — who have responded to Trump’s Electoral College and popular vote win by criticizing billionaires who backed him and promising ​“unprecedented resistance” during his second term — echoed Sanders’ remarks. Sharing Sanders’ statement on X — the social media platform owned by billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk — United Auto Workers (UAW) communications director Jonah Furman said: ​“The task has been clear for a decade. The question is only whether and when we will rise to the task.” Separately, the union’s president, Shawn Fain, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“UAW members around the country clocked in today under the same threat they faced yesterday: unchecked corporate greed destroying our lives, our families, and our communities.” “We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same,” Fain continued, pointing to the battle against ​“broken trade laws” like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and fights for good union jobs, a secure retirement for everyone, a living wage, affordable healthcare, and time for families. “It’s time for Washington, D.C. to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate,” added Fain, whose union endorsed Harris. ​“Will our government stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires? That’s the question we face today. And that’s the question we’ll face tomorrow. The answer lies with us. No matter who’s in office.” In a post-election column, Chuck Idelson, former communications senior strategist for National Nurses United, made the case that ​“amid the postmortems and reckoning that will now follow the wreckage of Donald Trump’s return to ​‘absolute’ power, as authorized by the Supreme Court, there are … two notes in particular that deserve a deeper dive.” “In Missouri, a state Trump won by 58%, voters also acted to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour and to require employers to provide paid sick leave to workers,” he pointed out. ​“In Nebraska, another red state won by Trump, voters also passed a paid sick leave measure, Initiative 436, by 75%.” In addition to the ballot measures, Idelson highlighted that ​“in the multitude of exit poll results, one particularly stands out — 94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump, the exact same percentage he received in 2020. The heavy campaign focus on pulling away Republican voters from Trump turned out to be a pipe dream. The old cliché ​‘it’s the economy stupid,’ triumphed again.” Harris’ campaign, he argued, ​“reflected the direction the Democratic Party establishment has taken, away from working-class issues since the advent of neoliberal policies in the 1970s and carried out by most Democratic Party presidents since.” Historian Harvey J. Kaye, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, took aim at the Democratic Party on social media Wednesday, noting failures to stand up to billionaires, raise the minimum wage, and pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“a self-avowed authoritarian successfully wielded the economic frustrations of millions to win the most consequential election of our nation’s history. The Democratic establishment has only itself to blame.” “Voters demanded a fundamental overhaul of a rigged economic system. When neoliberal Democrats dithered, Donald Trump offered to clear the board, and voters chose the dark unknown rather than the status quo,” Pearl added. ​“The only question remaining is, why are Democrats surprised? This is the entirely predictable result of a multi-decade strategy to appease the rich that met no serious resistance.” The Sunrise Movement — a youth-led climate group that worked to reach millions of young voters in swing states to defeat Trump — similarly stressed on social media Wednesday that ​“last night’s results were a call for change. Millions of people are fed up after living through decades of a rigged economy and corrupt political system. They are looking for someone to blame. It’s critical the Dem Party takes that seriously.” “For decades, Democrats have prioritized corporations over people. This is the result. Every working American feels the crisis. We can’t pay rent. Our government can’t pass basic legislation. The WEATHER has turned against us. And Dems look us in the eye and say it’s fine,” the group continued. ​“Trump loves corporations even more than Democrats do, but he ran an anti-establishment campaign that gave an answer to people’s desire for change.” “We can stop him, and we must,” Sunrise said of Trump. ​“But it’s going to take many thousands of people taking to the streets and preparing to strike. And it’s going to take mass movements putting out a better vision for our country than Trumpism and proving that we can make it happen.” This article was originally published by Common Dreams.

Title: Bitcoin surges as backers bet Donald Trump’s election will bring crypto into the mainstream

In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno (pictured, right, alongside vice-presidential nominee JD Vance) beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Photo: Getty Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. The largest digital asset rose as much as 9pc to $75,372 (€70,391) as early results showed Mr Trump barrelling towards a win. It traded at just below $74,000 as of 10:40am yesterday morning as networks declared Mr Trump had won the race, setting him up for a second term in the White House. The last peak was in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Mr Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Ms Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. Donald Trump holds hands with former first lady Melania Trump after speaking to supporters in West Palm Beach (Lynne Sladky/AP) "The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end," said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. "People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto." In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Crypto titans spent some $40m to defeat Mr Brown – a long-time sceptic of the industry – underlining the influence of their political outlays. The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 8pc. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31pc at one point. Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX exchange. "The first test of [Trump’s] credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office," said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced 75pc in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5bn of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year – among the most successful new ETFs in history.

That's the mental state I'm in right now, especially since I live in a rural part of the south (albeit NC which needs to figure out if they're Republican or Democrat because elected Trump and then Democrats for statewide office ???). I'm thinking of all the women opting out of dating/marrying/sleeping with men (I'm never letting one of those filthy devils touch me ever again) and the potential increase of SA from frustrated men. I'm def considering a gun. Ugh we really are living in a repeat of the 1920s/30s. Lindner was basically blocking every good idea the Dems/Greens had and only thought about himself and his rich party friends. He always had the least support in the polls but acted like HE was the leader. Basically a toddler, "if it doesn't go my way I'm not doing it".This was probably the outcome he wanted because he was already cuddling with the conservatives the past months. He's hoping that he will somehow make it in the parliament again next election and can form a coalition with them. Lindner is an ass and intentionally sabotaged the whole thing from the start. He wants to be part of the government but he also wants to be the one who is in charge which he obviously wouldn't be as the smallest partner in a coalition of 3 parties. So he's also playing opposition to his own coalition and basically keeping them hostage every time they have to figure out the finances. And now we've reached the point where SPD and Greens had enough. Scholz gave a speech that was a basically a big "fuck this guy!" explaining why he fired him for the good of the country. I guess it's now because we'd have elections next year anyway and the proposed timeline would only move things forward 6 months. I think in a way it's also a bit of a last-ditch effort to save face for Scholz, because he was a pretty weak leader. The coalition definitely struggled thanks to Lindner, but Scholz didn't do anyone any favours by not reigning him in earlier.

(Bloomberg) -- Precision Neuroscience Corp., a brain implant rival to Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp., has raised $93 million of a planned $100 million funding round, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal valued the startup at about $500 million. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The fresh fundraising gives the company a boost as it seeks to take on Neuralink, which has raised over $685 million, and other companies in the space including Science, which has raised $150 million. A spokeswoman for Precision declined to comment. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows the company had filed to raise as much as $150 million. Precision was founded in 2021 by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport, a co-founder of Neuralink, and Chief Executive Officer Michael Mager. Last year, it raised $41 million. Startups working on brain implants and related technology, or brain-machine interfaces, have gained considerable momentum in recent months. Neuralink’s device went into its first human patient as part of a trial earlier this year. And a team at the University of California, Davis, implanted an ALS patient with a device that allowed him to speak via a machine with unprecedented accuracy by reading his brain signals. Precision’s device is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, referring to the six layers that comprise the cerebral cortex, and represents a compromise between invasive and noninvasive brain-computer interface technologies. It requires surgery and slicing into the skull, but not into the tissue of the brain. Instead, the device sits on top of the organ, a method the company says avoids damaging any of that brain’s tissue. That’s a contrast with devices from companies including Blackrock Neurotech, Inbrain Neuroelectronics SL, Neuralink and Paradromics, which sit within brain tissue. A device from Synchron enters the brain like a stent, via blood vessels, and ultimately sits near the brain’s motor cortex. Another company, Science, says it’s working on devices that can sit both on or in brain tissue. Precision’s device is not yet greenlit by regulators, but it is in testing. The startup has implanted its device in several patients, albeit temporarily during surgeries, where the primary purpose was related to another goal, such as removing brain tumors. While the surgery is underway and with the patient’s permission, the Precision team puts its Layer 7 in place and uses it to detect neurological signals. The company has applied for Food and Drug Administration approval of a version of its device for temporary use for monitoring in hospital settings, and has said it hopes to have it on the market next year. That would provide a revenue stream to the fledgling company as it works on its other device: a permanent implant to treat paralysis. Such a device, if it works, is years from approval and commercial deployment. In a recent surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, Precision tested placing four of its microelectrode arrays — each one-fifth the thickness of a human hair — on the surface of a patient brain. Each array contains 1,024 electrodes, so deploying four arrays gives a total of 4,096, creating an unusually high level of detail. Competitors have far fewer. Neuralink’s device, for example, has 1,024 electrodes.

Last week I had the privilege to attend the inaugural New York BCI Symposium, a one-of-a-kind gathering that validated the astonishing popular appeal of BCI by spotlighting the field’s future opportunities and present-day limitations. The heady lineup featured over thirty experts including researchers, neurosurgeons, founders, advocates, and federal leaders, drawing a packed house of attendees spanning students, clinicians, investors and executives from around the world. Aligned in our common curiosity and interests, we mingled and traded perspectives on all things BCI. The two-day event was co-hosted by Mount Sinai BioDesign and the Department of Neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Presentations spanned key discussions in breakthrough methods, commercial strategy, ethics, and research initiatives. Speakers represented numerous programs from Mount Sinai’s network of interdisciplinary departments for brain health, suggesting that the world’s leading neurotech innovation ecosystem might be developing at New York City’s biggest hospital system. Mount Sinai Health System's world-class neurotech ecosystem is foundational for the future of BCI. But the hosts transcended an empire state of mind, inviting experts from competing New York hospitals, and brain trusts from Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, London, and the Netherlands. Such cross-pollination has been essential to the BCI field thus far, and serves as a testament to the collegial leadership of Dr. Joshua Bederson. As the system chair of neurosurgery and executive director of the biodesign program at Mount Sinai, Bederson’s earnest emceeing centered humility over hype and set the tone for two days of collaborative learning and discussion. The two BCI sponsors of the event, Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, offered dual visions of what an “interface” can be across numerous sessions. Synchron’s strategy bets on speed over size. Their minimally invasive Stentrode, whose endovascular insertion time is down to just 20 minutes, reliably translates signals into digital motor outputs to navigate a growing ecosystem of applications. Despite a relatively modest 16-channel array, Synchron’s focus on pragmatism and execution has garnered valuable respect and mindshare among neurosurgeons, federal officials, and the investor community. As an earlier stage company, Precision has chosen to optimize for the future over the immediate-term. Their “Layer 7” thin film array has 1024 electrodes in a flexible device that conforms to the cortex. While it has only been used in exploratory studies thus far, implantations will occur via a <1mm incision; once made the “micro-electrocorticography” array (micro-ECoG) will take about 20 seconds to place. The ability to record and stimulate at a field-leading volume will take longer to arrive in market, but likely offer greater options to build value for users when it does. Precision Neuroscience and Synchron anchored the symposium as sponsors Here are my top five sessions (actually, seven) focused on the most critical characters in the evolving narrative about BCI’s future: Brain health experts who founded companies to translate research and transform practice, and the early group of end users who’ve had actual skin in the game, known and celebrated as BCI Pioneers. Doug Weber, co-director at the NeuroMechatronics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University set the stage. His “why, what, how” history of major BCI milestones unfolded through six Pioneers’ stories, starting in 1996 with Marjorie Hirschberg, and continuing with with Phil Kennedy, Matt Nagle, Jan Scheurmann and Ian Burkhart, before stopping in 2015 with Nathan Copeland, who remains the world’s longest actively implanted (and most artistically prolific) user. Doug Weber from Carnegie Mellon kicked off the Symposium with an overview of BCI Pioneers and key ... [+] milestones. Weber also leveraged his broad industry experience as co-founder and CTO of Reach Neuro and advisor to numerous neurotech startups to frame two major challenges: First is accurately defining the market, which will involve validating and benchmarking outcomes against current alternatives for end users. Second is the umbrella of ethical, legal, social implications (ELSI) posed by real world adoption. This spans a diverse, cross-functional, and challenging mix of topics including data and device security, user agency, accessibility, equitability, policy reforms and more. While digital device control, a primarily “read” use case, remains the first focal area for most commercial BCI, efficacy trials are still needed “to understand where specific benefits are, and how uniform they are across a population,” which payers will require for reimbursement considerations. Weber also spoke to movement disorders, mental illness, and stroke recovery as expansion markets that could combine BCI with neuromodulation (“write.”) Across subsequent tracks, it became evident that the post-research, read-and-write future of BCI is not that far away. Chad Bouton, a professor and VP of Advanced Engineering at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes, presented a case study on “neural bypass.” This procedure pairs spinal cord stimulation and BCI to produce cortical mirroring around the site of injury. By exciting or “priming” the spinal cord, this approach can create enough neural plasticity to restore limited sensations, and enhance physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve strength and motor control for people who have lost independence through injury. Today, this remains a research effort requiring highly personalized surgical interventions and rehabilitation, rather than any off-the-shelf options. In response to a question about where neural bypasses will be in five years, Bouton emphasized his lab’s research focus to “promote plasticity any way we can” and the need for a commercial ecosystem of wearable stimulation with onboard AI that can pair with BCI systems and work from users’ homes. The subject of Bouton’s case study, Keith Thomas, who became paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident, was in the room with his sister to receive a rousing round of applause. In a brief chat with Bouton, Thomas and his sister after the session, I was moved by the trio’s banter and the depth of their connection, and grateful for the siblings’ candid input when asked how BCI could better serve users and caregivers today. I’ll explore this critical topic in future articles. David Putrino, PhD, a professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, opened this session with an overview of his lab’s approach to “rehabilitation and human performance.” This involves partnering with patients to adopt and adapt various neurotechnologies as part of active treatment, as well as working with regulatory agencies and payors to promote patient access outside of research settings. Putrino contrasted the impairment-focused medical model of disability with the social model, which works to remove or mitigate barriers to human performance. In this frame, BCI is arriving at a crossroads moment, wherein innovation is expanding from compensation (e.g. water bottle grippers for people without finger control) to restoration through things like functional electrical stimulation. He was joined on the stage by Christopher Kellner, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery who oversees various programs in care delivery, research, and training in the field of intracerebral care. Kellner’s work entails use of numerous FDA-cleared neurotechnologies, from implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation, to wearable sleeves paired with a non-invasive brain interface. David Putrino and Christopher Kellner's cross-functional, interdisciplinary collaboration spanning ... [+] neurotech, neurosurgery, PT & Rehab, and arm-wrestling insurers has helped patients like Katie regain functional independence after a stroke. The highlight of the track was hearing from a patient named Katie, who worked with both Kellner and Putrino to regain independence after a devastating stroke in 2019 left her paralyzed down her left side. Only in her early 30’s with a two year old at home, Katie was hospitalized for five months during the Covid-19 pandemic, which involved intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy, which helped but still left her with limited arm strength at discharge. After two years of haggling with three different insurers, Katie gained access to Medicare which enabled her to join Kellner’s trial for a vagus nerve stimulation implant. She described the surgery as “not bad,” the six weeks of additional rehab as “you get out what you put in,” and the treatment as “life-changing,” adding that “you can feel your brain rewiring, you can feel the neuroplasticity.” With her young daughter in the audience watching her mom on stage, Katie’s story represents both the possibilities of neurotech-enabled stroke care today, and the fiendish limitations too many Americans face from their health plans. It struck that Mount Sinai’s collaborative, interdisciplinary, tech-savvy, and practically oriented clinical model remains an exception rather than a norm compared to most health systems. The only thing better than watching videos of BCI Pioneers bending and breaking limits - speaking cybernetically, fistbumping presidents, playing games, making art - is hearing from them directly. Ian Burkhart took the stage numerous times to share his expert perspective as a liaison to the FDA, President of NASIC, philanthropic leader, published researcher, and all around advocate. In a chat with CNBC’s Ashley Capoot, he shared the story of his spinal cord injury and his clinical trial in 2014 that implanted him with a Blackrock Neuroport array. Seven years of clinical studies included a neural bypass procedure using technology from Battelle that temporarily reanimated his hand well enough to play Guitar Hero. In 2021, Burkhart was “explanted” when the trial’s funding ran out and a scalp infection developed around his implant. His perspective is that BCI represents an aspiration to deliver improvements over today’s available assistive technologies. When asked about wanting another BCI, he didn’t hesitate to say yes, but demurred that his eligibility remains in question due to prior history, and that now, “the bar is higher for what I would want.” At the top of his list are a fully implanted device to reduce odds of infection, a duration of at least ten years, and in-home functionality rather than limited access in the lab. Ian Burkhart & Ashley Capoot of CNBC spoke about how BCI can evolve from a research domain to a ... [+] field of patient care In another session, Burkhart joined Blair Casey, executive director of Team Gleason, and Jennifer French, MBA, for a nuanced discussion on the path forward in BCI. French lives with tetraplegia as a result of a snowboarding accident, and the extent of her neurotechnology advocacy and leadership cannot be understated. Her expertise founding and leading Neurotech Network, NASIC, and the iBCI-CC over the last decade were on display in a masterclass on pre-commercial strategy for the nascent BCI industry, from trust-building and hype mitigation, to functional indication roadmaps for people living with spinal cord injuries, to scaling community engagement for participation in clinical trials. Selling false hope about complete recovery and restoration via BCI should be avoided by all, and especially by my peers who work in media, marketing, and market research. Key trends for the industry to navigate include shrinking rehab times for spinal cord injury, low clinician awareness and access to new tech, and the need to “jump the chasm” from engaging people enrolled in BCI registries to engaging the broader community of those affected. Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science Corp, shared their vision restoration pivotal trial, in which a photovoltaic stimulating array implanted at the back of blind patients’ retinas, paired with special eyeglasses, restored the ability to see for the vast majority of the trial’s 38 participants. The implant, acquired in a commercial chess move this spring, is a solar-powered marvel the size of confetti that fits perfectly over Abe Lincoln on a penny’s tail. Through the company’s foundry and a new full stack of BCI tools, Science could bring the cost of in-human BCI development down by a factor of 20. Hodak’s broader vision for BCI is grounded yet groundbreaking. Hodak was joined on the stage by Precision Neuroscience’s CSO Ben Rapoport, Synchron’s CEO Tom Oxley, Blackrock Neurotech’s CSO Florian Solzbacher, Paradromics’ CSO Vikash Gilja and and Meta’s (formerly co- founder of CTRL-Labs) Patrick Kaifosh. Moderated by Bloomberg Reporter Sarah McBride, the discussion covered a number of emerging industry tensions: standardizing outputs from differentiated systems, collaboration versus competition, demonstrating value to patients versus payors, and prioritizing technical optimization versus real world pragmatism in allocating limited time and money. Regulatory strategy, payer and clinician engagement, and AI filled a bulk of the Q&A. The diversity of technologies, form factors, invasiveness, user base and other factors limited the depth and generalizability of this conversation, but two key themes emerged: the need to focus on effective productization over technical perfection, and the tailored approach to designing clinical outcomes. The latter will make standardization in this nascent industry a challenge (more on that below.) In conversation on AI’s role in BCI, participants summarized technical advances in ML for signal processing or deep learning for chip design, as well as generative AI. LLMs can match or mimic the “art of human expression” as part of a product, or speed up the pdf-laden burdens of regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and other mission-critical operational obligations in building a class III medical device company. Based on the brainpower and leadership on this stage, the future of the industry appears in good hands. From left to right: Sarah McBride (Bloomberg), Ben Rapoport (Precision), Tom Oxley (Synchron), ... [+] Florian Solzbacher (Blackrock), Vikash Gilja (Paradromics), Patrick Kaifosh (CTRL Labs/Meta), Max Hodak (Science) Many if not most of the sessions I attended began by summarizing BCI history, underscoring the robust foundation of knowledge, tools, and practice that clinical researchers have built for the last two decades. But even as scores of brilliant neuroengineers advance technical innovations and test experimental interventions in research settings, the various experts on stage echoed the plain view that industry is the engine that will drive this field forward for the next two decades, for better or for worse. The BCI Industrial Revolution is Underway (from Doug Weber's opening session) This set up the billion dollar question: What will the future hold for BCI startups? According to investors, it’s actually hundreds of billions. Alex Morgan, partner at Khosla Ventures and investor in Synchron and other neurotech startups, framed the opportunity as an unprecedented convergence of historic advances in measurement, materials and other technologies, from AI to AR and much in between. In a later session, Dr. Benjamin Rapoport of Precision Neuroscience referred to this confluent phenomenon as “Moore’s Law for Applied Neuroscience,” with a growth curve mapping electrode channel count over the last 50 years. In Morgan’s words, BCI (and other non-implanted neurotech) “will give us a fine-grained attenuation of the electrical network in the manner we want, when we want.” Thus, he argued, if the 20th century was the century of the heart, where a similar multi-faceted revolution in cardiology innovation now “creates over $300b in value a year” by augmenting lifespan and healthspan, then the 21st century will belong to the brain. But as we enter the second quarter of the century, the BCI industry today has yet to put any points on the board, in terms of adding economic value to people’s lives. Khosla Ventures' Alex Morgan framed the convergence of neurotechnology innovation as the Century of ... [+] the Brain. One attendee I met at lunch smirked that BCI appears to be a solution looking for a problem, a view plenty of others share. I’ve personally met or heard from too many BCI Pioneers to agree. His point was well-taken though, that reimbursement is hard, and navigating the market opportunity comes down to a specific (if daunting) set of “known unknowns” that emerged over the two days. A mentor of mine, Dr. Jordan Shlain, cautions against mistaking a clear view for a short distance. Simply put, the road ahead will be hard. Advancing the field of BCI will depend on several factors that emerged over multiple sessions, as well as the new reality of highly unpredictable federal leadership, whose impact over the next four years at FDA, CMS, and other agencies remains to be seen. As per David McMullen, the FDA’s director of the office of neurological & physical medicine devices, regulatory science at the agency entails “developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety and performance of the products it regulates.” His new boss, Michele Tarver, has a history of patient-centered public-private partnerships. McMullen divulged his career-long interest in BCI prior to joining the feds and listed numerous efforts underway to engage BCI stakeholders and, in particular, accelerate market success through TAP (“FDA Breakthrough on steroids”), specific funding mechanisms, and aligning COA. Jen French also identified informing regulatory science as a key goal of the iBCI-CC, describing the group’s work as a “pre-competitive sandbox” to develop technical and clinical standards, user preferences, endpoints economic analysis. These efforts are bolstered by the work of researchers like Abbey Sawyer, a postdoctoral fellow who shared her work in developing digital “activities of daily living” to leverage clinical trials for broader impact. Abbey Sawyer shared insights about how to measure the impact of BCI in clinical research. And yet: Despite the bonhomie, mutual respect, and promising rhetoric, the reality is that alignment will be challenging. In the BCI startup panel, after describing how nuances in product and procedures will drive differences in trial design and clinical outcomes, Tom Oxley summed it up: “Everyone wants to do something slightly different.” Persuading payers to cover BCI will undeniably become the field’s top goal. McMullen’s counterpart on the symposium’s closing panel was TJ Sutphin, Ombudsman for Pharma and Tech at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Sutphin also spoke at the aforementioned COA session for BCI last month. His primer covered coding and coverage channels, “innovator’s guide” resources, and touched on coverage decisions for speech generating devices, DBS, cochlear implants, and other topics. Despite the airtime, I felt that he offered little insight to CMS’s specific thinking about BCI. This is underscores the need to recruit health plan medical directors and commercial reimbursement leaders from Medtronic, Boston Scientific, or other neuromodulation companies to future discussions about BCI. The job of CMS, and to a lesser extent, FDA, is to be reactive to engagement from BCI companies, moreso than act as proactive partners. Mount Sinai has an opportunity - I would argue, an imperative - to leverage their market relationships as an experienced health system and invite their insurer counterparts into the room in future iterations of this event. This would amount to two-way opportunity for payers to educate attendees on their thought process and perspectives, and absorb key insights on the benefits and value of BCI from some of the world’s leading experts. Patient advocacy will bridge the divide between clinical research and commercial success. Across the two days, Pioneer voices and videos were elevated on the stage in a way that transcended marketing or storytelling; at this early stage, each and every BCI user represents a highly valuable and slightly different case study filled with technical, clinical, practical, and socioeconomic insights that remain largely underleveraged. Rather than asking Pioneers like Burkhart to repeat their stories, the field needs to lean on their detailed market research, numerous publications, federal advocacy efforts, strategic philanthropy, and other insights. Commercial success will require integrating BCI into smart homes, navigating limits of disability policy and routes to reimplantation, and improving ethics of clinical trials. An example of the latter came from Dan Rubin, Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School/Mass General, where BCI trial participants can “reconsent” twice, for up to an additional seven years of using their BCI following the end of their trial. Caregiver perspectives were infrequently mentioned in the sessions I attended. BCI cannot cure paralysis, so family members and caregivers have a critical role in expanding conversations on decentralizing clinical research, exploring economic evidence generation around time and costs, and configuring BCI for communication and in-home deployment. The latter was explored briefly by Mariska J. Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center in a case study about “nocturnal caregiver calling” that drew questions from BCI executives in the audience, suggesting that such key explorations of daily living should not be relegated to academic research. Like the titles of many presenters, this recap has become a bit long, so I’ll close with a powerful framing by Peter Yoo, Synchron’s Senior Director of Neuroscience and Algorithms. In designing functional systems in dynamic interplay between hardware, software, and the end user, Yoo spoke about balancing reliability off the shelf, and adaptability to account for individual customization and technical advances: “This isn’t just a simple engineering challenge. When the human is in the loop, it impacts the whole system.” BCI then, is more than a field of research, a technology product or a commercial market. It’s a platform for optimizing the common boundaries of computers and human beings. The next era will not spin out from technical revolutions in a laboratory, but by helping people in their homes. Like the word BCI itself, it’s easier said than done. For all the students, engineers, doctors, executives, and others working in this field, the future is not just undeniably bright - it’s here.

Title: Trump win sparks big rally in stocks
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/6/trump-win-sparks-big-rally-in-stocks
Time Published: 2024-11-06T18:24:23Z

Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $1 billion in trading volume within the first 20 minutes of market opening on November 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

Title: Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.

The firm’s focus on affordable luxury and its strong network of licensed stores provide a healthy foundation for future growth. The analysts are optimistic about Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) as a result of its strong licensing model and healthy post-pandemic recovery. The company’s strategy revolves around the successful use of licensing, which led to the expansion of its brand reach across Mainland China and fortified Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s position in Hong Kong/Macau and several other international markets. The company continues to focus on cost efficiency and store optimization and remains well-placed to manage potential rental cost hikes. Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s successful reinvigoration of tourist sales and a lower gold hedging ratio should help it to capitalize on rising gold prices. The company highlighted that the decline in same-store sales in the Mainland market (which includes self-operated shops and licensed shops) and the Hong Kong market narrowed since September. From 1 October - 14 October 2024, its overall same-store sales performance demonstrated some improvements as compared to Q2. The mainland government continues to work on boosting domestic demand.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait.

As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors.

Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer of Blue Whale Growth Fund, has similar views on the stock.

Title: PAC free to investigate MAHB sale, says Transport Minister

Wednesday, 06 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he has no qualms if the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) investigates the sale of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) shares to a company linked to BlackRock. He said that the ministry, through the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), is only focused on regulating competition in the industry. "If the PAC chairman Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudi wants, she may call for a meeting any time to review the deal's details. "Mavcom only looks into industry dealings from a regulatory perspective ... (and) has no say in its equity distribution. "Eventhough Mavcom is under the ministry's purview, I am not directly involved in its decision making as meetings are attended by its own board members, and the decisions they make are independent and objective based on their mandate to regulate the industry," Loke told Parliament during his ministry's winding down speech of Budget 2025 on Wednesday (Nov 6). Loke was responding to concerns raised by Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) over the sale of MAHB's shares to a foreign company, with the latter demanding why MAHB shares could not have been sold to local investors. This comes after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), along with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB's privatisation move. The deal was criticised by Opposition politicians after it emerged that GIP is in talks to be sold to BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel.

Title: Puttshack’s Technological Twist On Mini-Golf Hits 20 Locations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikedojc/2024/11/06/puttshacks-technological-twist-on-mini-golf-hits-20-locations/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T12:29:34Z

The view inside a Puttshack location Putt-putt, an amusement partaken by seven-to-seventy-year-olds may conjure memories of analog-fun—ramps leading into clown mouths and windmills with blades guarding the path to the hole that your opponent would have to spin to get turning. But to younger generations, a digitally enhanced version is fast becoming par for the course. Puttshack, a fast-growing eatertainment name, has just opened the doors on its 20th location in Dunwoody, Georgia, their second venue in the Atlanta GTA. The high-tech concept which received a $150 million capital infusion from BlackRock two years-ago, ditches miniature pencils and scorecards for their proprietary Trackaball technology, where the ball itself keeps tabs on players’ strokes and tabulates scores. “It knows the difference between you hitting the ball, and the ball hitting features on the course and so much to my children’s chagrin, you can’t actually cheat in the game so it does take some elements out of the traditional mini golf I remember as a kid,” CEO Logan Powell explained. Unlike traditional golf where were the lower your tally the better, scoring is via a modified Stableford system of sorts, with points awarded for birdies, pars and hole-in-ones, yet also subtracted for rolling into a hazard. There’s almost a pinball dynamic at play, with “supertube” markers on each hole that if hit, gush up point totals, setting the stage for plenty of lead changes within a round, which is by design. Powell views the dynamic scoring system through the prism of competitive socializing and wanted to facilitate as many opportunities to turn a round, well around, as possible. “We wanted to make sure that if you want to make a comeback, it levels the playing field a little bit and I can tell you from experience that I can go from crushing it one round and play the same course and just do horribly. Having those fun innovations, which also build on themselves—if you hit multiple super tubes in a row you get extra bonus points—the game encourages you to build up streaks and really go after it,” Powell adds, that often at the wire, it’s still anybody’s game. Holes feature skateboard style half pipes, a take on Connect Four, a tribute to beer pong and a basketball hole where a robot defender attempts to prevent balls from dunking.Its fair to say that their philosophy on hole design, is to keep the creative wheels turning. “We have a phenomenal innovation team based out of the U.K. who design all of our holes and we have new ones we’re developing now. We wanted to take the fun, nostalgic aspects of mini golf that you would think of from playing the traditional game but elevate it to target the demographic that tends to come to our stores—the 21-39 year old crowd,” Powell said, adding that they like elements to be recognizable but then to add a technology twist. Less than a year ago, they introduced the Challenge Hole, a private mini-golf suite where couples and small groups could eat-drink-play in a single location while playing a variety of putting themed games including a spin on Nintendo’s Duck Hunt, the point and shoot classic currently celebrating its 40th anniversary. “The ducks go across a screen and there are slots to put the the ball into and you’re trying to hit the ducks,” Powell explained, adding that reserving the Challenge Hole is popular for date nights. Addison, Texas is the beta test for the product and they plan to offer it as well in future locations, though a decision to retrofit existing locations to include one is still being considered. Puttshack’s main differentiating factor from other eatertainment concepts facilitating flatstick fun is how much it leans into technology. Though you find scorecards either at Puttery, which uses touchscreens to keep score or Tiger Woods’ Popstroke where an app is used to keep tallies and order food and drinks. The new Dunwoody location in Northern Atlanta, typifies the type of real estate sweet spots they scout for in order to hit their demographic trifecta—families, the corporate crowd and adults seeking an evening entertainment option. Domestically, locations average an ample 25,000 square feet and include dedicated private event space which get a lot of use over the holidays. “We typically target more urban locations, those hotspot areas within a market where you or your friends would think about going. When we think about a Puttshack location, it needs to be in an area where people tend to work, live, and play. We want to make sure we are in the consideration mix there,” Powell said. A group dining at a Puttshack location Beyond the mini-golf experience, the apps at Puttshack are as international as a Presidents Cup squad, offering shareables that range from Lebanese hummus and Korean bao buns to Thai fried chicken and Canadian-style poutine. Every location even has its own take on spring rolls—dubbed ‘tailpipes’—tailored to the local market. The Atlanta area locations feature fire-braised chicken, collard greens, and pimento cheese, served with BBQ and peach dipping sauces. Puttshack also gives back through its menu, with $1 of each tailpipe purchase supporting area charities. Their Boston location donates to the New England Center for Children, while the newly opened Dunwoody site supports Lost-n-Found, a local nonprofit that provides services to homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Powell expects the demand for experiential entertainment with friends, family and loved ones outside the home will continue to grow and welcomes new concepts pile into the space. “I think winners within the space will tend to have a technological competitive edge and that’s why we continue to innovate and make sure we have fresh ideas.” With only 20 units, Powell feels Puttshack is still merely scratching the surface in terms of expanding their footprint. On the near horizon, they have new stores in various stages of completion in the Minneapolis, Chicago and Fort Lauderdale areas and see plenty of opportunity to continue to expand in markets they already have a presence in, as they’ve done in Atlanta.

Title: Trump Media, Tesla, and crypto stocks surge as Trump wins — and clean energy companies tumble

Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election boosted shares of his social media company, Elon Musk's Tesla, as well as cryptocurrencies and related stocks on Wednesday. The former president's reelection sent renewable-energy stocks tumbling in premarket trading as traders bet his administration would be less friendly in terms of subsidies and regulation. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group surged as much as 62% to $55 as investors wagered Truth Social's parent company, which counts Trump as its largest shareholder, would benefit from his second term. The stock — which has Trump's initials, DJT, as its ticker — was trading 33% higher at last check. If the gain holds, Trump would be about $1.3 billion richer on paper given his near-53% stake in the company. Tesla stock rose as much as 15% in premarket trading and was poised to open at its highest level in more than a year. Musk, the electric-vehicle maker's CEO, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal champions and closest advisors. If Tesla's overnight gain holds, Musk — already the world's richest person — would become $14 billion richer based on his roughly 13% stake. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto, climbed past $75,000 for the first time on election night before paring gains. Other digital coins including ethereum also jumped. Crypto stocks jumped on the prospect of a friendlier US regulatory environment under Trump. Coinbase and MicroStrategy both rose 13% ahead of the open. Conventional financial stocks also gained with Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR rising between 6% and 9% in the US premarket. Traders expect Wall Street banks, asset managers, and private equity firms to benefit from tax cuts and deregulation under Trump. In contrast, clean-energy stocks slid with Plug Power, SunRun, First Solar, and Enphase Energy all dropping at least 10% in premarket trading. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Orsted and rival Vestas fell 10% and 8% respectively in Frankfurt trading. The declines likely reflect concerns that Trump's reelection will lead to the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration, which provided large-scale tax credits for renewable-energy providers. The broader stock market gained before the open with futures underlying the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 2.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.8%.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record as Pro-Crypto Trump Heads Toward US Victory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The largest digital asset rose as much as 10% to $76,106 with Trump winning a second term, the Republicans taking back the Senate and the House looking increasingly more likely to remain red. The increase was the most since the last peak in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. “The crypto industry feels like it’s been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end,” said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management Inc. “People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto.” In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Crypto titans spent some $40 million to defeat Brown — a longtime skeptic of the industry — underlining the influence of their political outlays. The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 12%. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31% at one point. Gensler’s Fate Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. “The first test of his credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced more than 80% in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-Bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5 billion of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year — among the most successful new ETFs in history. --With assistance from Teresa Xie and Dave Liedtka.

Title: Bitcoin – Volatility reigns as election uncertainty spurs $541M in BTC ETF outflows

Could the inflows into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF indicate a broader shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs? With the U.S Presidential election around the corner, the crypto market has seen a surge in volatility. Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in particular, have felt the impact, with notable outflows observed on 1st and 4th November. With Election Day now here, uncertainty surrounding potential political shifts is continuing to add to the ups and downs of the Bitcoin ETF landscape. According to the latest data from Farside Investors on 4 November, Bitcoin ETFs recorded significant outflows – Totaling $541.1 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the trend, with outflows hitting $169.6 million, followed closely by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB which saw $138.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB also faced declines, with outflows of $89.5 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63.7 million outflows too. Although most ETFs reported outflows, Invesco’s BTCO and WisdomTree’s BTCW stood out by maintaining stable flows without any outflows. Despite the broader downturn, however, not all updates were negative. BlackRock’s IBIT notably bucked the trend by attracting $38.4 million in inflows. Reflecting this optimism within the crypto community, Dr. Dinero shared a positive perspective, highlighting hopeful sentiment despite recent market turbulence. Source: Dr. Dinero/X Another X user noted, Source: Flip/X Looking at the cumulative data though, BTC ETFs have generated significant inflows since their launch, with volumes of $23 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $26 billion in inflows. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst, had previously forecasted that BTC ETFs might soon exceed the holdings attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was expected that these ETFs will reach this milestone by mid-December. However, a recent single-day purchase by BlackRock, totaling 12,127 BTC, has accelerated this timeline. In response to this significant accumulation, Balchunas shared his insights on X. He highlighted the swift momentum ETFs have gained in Bitcoin’s space. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” This recent surge in Bitcoin ETF activity has coincided with notable price volatility in BTC itself. After touching $73,000 just days ago, Bitcoin has now dipped below the $70,000-threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $68,807.31, following a slight 0.10% drop over the last 24 hours. On the weekly charts, it fell by over 3%. Thus, as election season adds an extra layer of uncertainty, the crypto market might be gearing up for further volatility in the coming days.

The world's largest crypto rose to $74,504 on the day, beating its previous March all-time high of $73,780, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now up more than 9% over the last 24 hours. It has more than doubled in price in the last 12 months. It comes amid the U.S. election results between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the former gaining an early lead in electoral college votes. Trump or Harris need 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. Trump leads with 198 to Harris' 99, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press. Analysts have been citing a "Trump trade" is in play, which, they say, has helped bolster risk assets, including equities and crypto. The business mogul and former reality TV star has explicitly said he will help the digital asset industry, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has been quieter on the issue. Trump's renewed shot at claiming a second term in the White House has been keenly felt around the crypto industry, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel. "Trump has made material inroads in the last month," he told Decrypt before election day. "Many business leaders are all making phone calls to Donald Trump to mend fences." "There’s definitely some momentum for Trump, in my opinion," Sigel added. Previously with Bitcoin cycles, the crypto has hit highs following the asset's quadrennial halving event. This time, it's different, though, and the crypto last hit an all-time high in March, just ahead of April's halving. Bitcoin's halving happens every four years and cuts miner rewards in half, forcing those who secure the network to work harder and allowing fewer digital coins to be minted and put into circulation. But Bitcoin's spike earlier this year arguably comes down to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved 10 of the vehicles, which make it easy for people to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and trade on stock exchanges. A flood of capital has since entered the space, as traditional investors, previously too cautious about buying the asset, can now do so easily via products by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Such funds have seen more than $20 billion worth of inflows so far this year.

Title: ‘I was lucky to be there’ – No hard feelings as Garry Ringrose looks back on his first All Black experience

Garry Ringrose: 'I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that.' Photo: Sportsfile Garry Ringrose had the best seat in the house as he watched history unfold at Solider Field in November 2016. Like Joey Carbery, Ringrose was named in an Ireland match-day squad for the first time, but rather than follow his former Blackrock College team-mate in helping to see out the historic victory over the All Blacks, he remained on the bench for the entire 80 minutes. Scrum-half Kieran Marmion found himself in a similar position in Chicago that day, but even looking back on it now, eight years later, there was no sense of bitterness on Ringrose’s part at missing out on such a momentous occasion. Instead, Joe Schmidt handed the centre his Test debut at home the following week in the slightly less glamorous win over Canada. “It was funny, I was 21,” Ringrose recalled. “Myself and Joey Carbery were on the bench and both of us would have been nervous going into the game. “I was lucky to be on the plane because Keith Earls got injured during the week and that gave me the opportunity to be on the bench. “I couldn’t believe that I’d been selected. After the game I had a text or two saying hard luck that I hadn’t got on but I was laughing to myself because that didn’t even cross my mind. “To be there for such a special occasion, I felt I was lucky to be over there. “Even the fact that Joey came on and played so well, I was coat-tailing on how well he had done because we had gone through the week together. “It wouldn’t have been a thing, any sort of frustration. I was just excited to be there and experience such a monumental day in Irish sports history, I think. Since then, I guess I’ve been lucky to play in the ones here. “There was one game, the autumn after the Lions tour when Robbie [Henshaw] and Bundee [Aki] would have been together [up until then] and Robbie was injured which gave me the opportunity to play and get the win on a special night in the Aviva. “Experiences like that stand out and you never take them for granted, to be lucky enough to beat such an exceptional side. It’ll take everything this week to try and repeat that.” As for what Schmidt said to Ringrose after keeping him on the bench against the All Blacks, given it is a rarity in modern-day rugby not to use all eight available replacements, Ringrose added: “I can’t remember exactly but I do remember after the game in the hotel, obviously everyone was celebrating, he let me know, just a heads-up, you’re going to be starting next week against Canada. “I was pretty nervous from that point on. I wouldn’t have expected or looked for an apology at all. Everyone was buzzing, it wasn’t even a thing.” Ringrose is set to be in the thick of the action against New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium on Friday night, as Ireland aim to finish a year, which has included a Six Nations title win and a Test victory in South Africa, on a high. “When I was younger in the first couple of squads you have the blinkers on, but in the last couple of years I’ve been able to look at it from the wider lens and appreciate the amount of support we have or that I can see around the country,” Ringrose (29) maintained. “And I don’t know what it is, there just seems to be a buzz about it, definitely in the World Cup. “I know my first World Cup was in Japan so it was unbelievable travelling support, but going through a World Cup that was a little bit closer to home and seeing and feeling the support was unbelievable. “And then there’s a continuation from there, I’ve certainly felt.” Ringrose’s battle with his opposite number Rieko Ioane, who may face a frosty reception from the Dublin crowd following his war of words with Johnny Sexton, is set to be one of many box-office match-ups. “I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that,” Ringrose added. “And in the past it shows that even when we are all-in [with our] preparation, they can still expose it with the strength they have. “They’re a team you just have to be at your best against to try to beat them. And we’ve been lucky in the past in some of those seven games to get a win and then some unfortunate results in there as well. “It’s something I never take for granted, and I’m excited for the challenge. “I guess from my experience over the last couple of years, games can fall on such fine margins and against a team of their quality, even more so. “[It will be] unbelievably special and everyone in the group would be grateful to get an opportunity to play, to deliver for the support that will be there and the support that will be watching on TV. We’re just trying to do our best to prepare as best as we possibly can.”

Title: Why Professional Investors Often Misjudge the Market After a Presidential Election

Professional investors often assume they are free of political bias. However, research suggests this is far from true. Political bias is proven to cost investors who may over- or under-estimate the state of the economy depending on whether their preferred party is in power. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In a June Nasdaq article, investor Martin Tiller observed how many left-leaning investors dumped stocks after Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 and right-leaning investors after Barack Obama’s victory in 2008. Both were motivated by notions that the wrong party had won the election and the economy would pay a price. Yet, the S&P 500 consistently grew in the months following each president’s inauguration, duping the investors who let their bias get in the way. Academic research suggests this is a widespread phenomenon. A 2017 Journal of Financial Markets study highlighted how individuals’ investment behaviors shifted when their preferred political party held the White House. The study found that when their favored party was in power, investors became more optimistic, perceived markets as less risky, and increased allocations to high-beta, small-cap, and value stocks. Consequently, nonpartisan investors consistently outperformed their Democratic- and Republican-leaning counterparts, according to a University of Chicago study of fund performance from 2015 to 2021. Political bias affects not only market perspectives but also stock selection. Mutual fund managers often hold onto losing stocks issued by politically allied companies longer than justified, a behavioral pattern known as the “disposition effect,” according to a study by the University of Kansas of nearly 1,300 actively managed mutual funds between 2000 and 2015. In other words, fund managers may overestimate the competence of companies led by executives with similar political beliefs to theirs. The researchers found that funds with more politically-motivated stock selection have lower return-to-risk ratios. Political bias isn’t confined to equity investors. A 2020 study tracking credit analysts from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s between 2000 and 2018 showed that those not aligned with the sitting president’s party tended to issue more frequent downgrades of corporate credit ratings. Nevertheless, historical market data provides a stark reality check. Long-term market performance has proven resilient regardless of which political party holds power. The S&P 500, for example, has typically risen regardless of partisan shifts in Washington. While executive decisions from the White House can be large in scope and have long-term impact, markets can often work through them. For example, when Trump launched a trade war with China in September 2019, some analysts expected Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone sales to fall by as much as 8 million units and its share price to plummet. In the following 12 months, Apple’s stock rose 160 percent compared to the S&P 500’s 16 percent. Likewise, after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, many expected his green energy policies would hurt oil and natural gas companies. And yet, Morningstar’s data finds U.S. energy companies outperformed the S&P 500 in the year following. Political sentiments can also influence how major shareholders vote on corporate policies. Major mutual funds and asset managers tend to vote in lockstep with the political party in control at the time, according to joint research from the City University of Hong Kong and INSEAD published in the International Banker. Examining shareholder voting behavior between 2004 and 2021, the researchers found major asset managers were substantially more likely to support environmental and social initiatives when a Democrat was in the White House than when a Republican was. However, instead of bias getting in the way, another possible explanation is that major asset managers, like BlackRock (BLK), StateStreet and Vanguard, may be acting in accordance with the prevailing political party to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Further solidifying their findings, the researchers noted that voting behavior on corporate policies unrelated to environmental and social justice issues remained consistent, regardless of which political party was in power. Data confirms that the stock market reflects investors’ election jitters. VIX, an index measuring volatility in the stock market, is about 6 percent higher during election years than in other years. A higher VIX reading signals increased expected volatility and heightened market uncertainty from investors. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: X Is a White-Supremacist Site
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T19:41:17Z

Donald Trump has won the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Read more from our writers on what happens next: Elon Musk has made one of Twitter’s most glaring problems into a core feature on X. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. X has always had a Nazi problem. I’ve covered the site, formerly known as Twitter, for more than a decade and reported extensively on its harassment problems, its verification (and then de-verification) of a white nationalist, and the glut of anti-Semitic hatred that roiled the platform in 2016. But something is different today. Heaps of unfiltered posts that plainly celebrate racism, anti-Semitism, and outright Nazism are easily accessible and possibly even promoted by the site’s algorithms. All the while, Elon Musk—a far-right activist and the site’s owner, who is campaigning for and giving away millions to help elect Donald Trump—amplifies horrendous conspiracy theories about voter fraud, migrants run amok, and the idea that Jewish people hate white people. Twitter was always bad if you knew where to look, but because of Musk, X is far worse. (X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this article.) It takes little effort to find neo-Nazi accounts that have built up substantial audiences on X. “Thank you all for 7K,” one white-nationalist meme account posted on October 17, complete with a heil-Hitler emoji reference. One week later, the account, which mostly posts old clips of Hitler speeches and content about how “Hitler was right,” celebrated 14,000 followers. One post, a black-and-white video of Nazis goose-stepping, has more than 187,000 views. Another racist and anti-Semitic video about Jewish women and Black men—clearly AI-generated—has more than 306,000 views. It was also posted in late October. Many who remain on the platform have noticed X decaying even more than usual in recent months. “I’ve seen SO many seemingly unironic posts like this on Twitter recently this is getting insane,” one X user posted in response to a meme that the far-right influencer Stew Peters recently shared. It showed an image of Adolf Hitler holding a telephone with overlaid text reading, “Hello … 2024? Are you guys starting to get it yet?” Peters appended the commentary, “Yes. We’ve noticed.” The idea is simply that Hitler was right, and X users ate it up: As of this writing, the post has received about 67,000 likes, 10,000 reposts, and 11.4 million views. When Musk took over, in 2022, there were initial reports that hate speech (anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs) was surging on the platform. By December of that year, one research group described the increase in hate speech as “unprecedented.” And it seems to only have gotten worse. There are far more blatant examples of racism now, even compared with a year ago. In September, the World Bank halted advertising on X after its promoted ads were showing up in the replies to pro-Nazi and white-nationalist content from accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. Search queries such as Hitler was right return posts with tens of thousands of views—they’re indistinguishable from the poison once relegated to the worst sites on the internet, including 4chan, Gab, and Stormfront. The hatred isn’t just coming from anonymous fringe posters either. Late last month, Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, published a racist, threatening post about the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, saying they’re from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere.” Then he issued an ultimatum: “All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” he wrote in the post, referencing Inauguration Day. Higgins eventually deleted the post at the request of his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle but refused to apologize. “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want,” he told CNN later that day. And although Higgins did eventually try to walk his initial post back, clarifying that he was really referring to Haitian gangs, the sentiment he shared with CNN is right. The lawmaker can put up another vile post maligning an entire country whenever he desires. Not because of his right to free speech—which exists to protect against government interference—but because of how Musk chooses to operate his platform. Despite the social network’s policy that prohibits “incitement of harassment,” X seemingly took no issue with Higgins’s racist post or its potential to cause real-world harm for Springfield residents. (The town has already closed and evacuated its schools twice because of bomb threats.) And why would X care? The platform, which reinstated thousands of banned accounts following Musk’s takeover, in 2022—accounts that belong to QAnon supporters, political hucksters, conspiracy theorists, and at least one bona fide neo-Nazi—is so inundated with bigoted memes, racist AI slop, and unspeakable slurs that Higgins’s post seemed almost measured by comparison. In the past, when Twitter seemed more interested in enforcing content-moderation standards, the lawmaker’s comments may have resulted in a ban or some other disciplinary response: On X, he found an eager, sympathetic audience willing to amplify his hateful message. His deleted post is instructive, though, as a way to measure the degradation of X under Musk. The site is a political project run by a politically radicalized centibillionaire. The worthwhile parts of Twitter (real-time news, sports, culture, silly memes, spontaneous encounters with celebrity accounts) have been drowned out by hateful garbage. X is no longer a social-media site with a white-supremacy problem, but a white-supremacist site with a social-media problem. Musk has certainly bent the social network to support his politics, which has recently involved joking on Tucker Carlson’s show (which streams on X) that “nobody is even bothering to try to kill Kamala” and repurposing the @america handle from an inactive user to turn it into a megaphone for his pro-Trump super PAC. Musk has also quite clearly reengineered the site so that users see him, and his tweets, whether or not they follow him. When Musk announced his intent to purchase Twitter, in April 2022, the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein aptly noted that “Musk reveals what he wants Twitter to be by how he acts on it.” By this logic, it would seem that X is vying to be the official propaganda outlet not just for Trump generally but also for the “Great Replacement” theory, which states that there is a global plot to eradicate the white race and its culture through immigration. In just the past year, Musk has endorsed multiple posts about the conspiracy theory. In November 2023, in response to a user named @breakingbaht who accused Jews of supporting bringing “hordes of minorities” into the United States, Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.” Musk’s post was viewed more than 8 million times. Read: Musk’s Twitter is the blueprint for a MAGA government Though Musk has publicly claimed that he doesn’t “subscribe” to the “Great Replacement” theory, he appears obsessed with the idea that Republican voters in America are under attack from immigrants. Last December, he posted a misleading graph suggesting that the number of immigrants arriving illegally was overtaking domestic birth rates. He has repeatedly referenced a supposed Democratic plot to “legalize vast numbers of illegals” and put an end to fair elections. He has falsely suggested that the Biden administration was “flying ‘asylum seekers’, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona” and argued that, soon, “everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco.” According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of 53,000 of Musk’s posts, the billionaire has posted more about immigration and voter fraud than any other topic (more than 1,300 posts in total), garnering roughly 10 billion views. But Musk’s interests extend beyond the United States. This summer, during a period of unrest and rioting in the United Kingdom over a mass stabbing that killed three children, the centibillionaire used his account to suggest that a civil war there was “inevitable.” He also shared (and subsequently deleted) a conspiracy theory that the U.K. government was building detainment camps for people rioting against Muslims. Additionally, X was instrumental in spreading misinformation and fueling outrage among far-right, anti-immigration protesters. In Springfield, Ohio, X played a similar role as a conduit for white supremacists and far-right extremists to fuel real-world harm. One of the groups taking credit for singling out Springfield’s Haitian community was Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group known for marching through city streets waving swastikas. Blood Tribe had been focused on the town for months, but not until prominent X accounts (including Musk’s, J. D. Vance’s, and Trump’s) seized on a Facebook post from the region did Springfield become a national target. “It is no coincidence that there was an online rumor mill ready to amplify any social media posts about Springfield because Blood Tribe has been targeting the town in an effort to stoke racial resentment against ‘subhuman’ Haitians,” the journalist Robert Tracinski wrote recently. Tracinski argues that social-media channels (like X) have been instrumental in transferring neo-Nazi propaganda into the public consciousness—all the way to the presidential-debate stage. He is right. Musk’s platform has become a political tool for stoking racial hatred online and translating it into harassment in the physical world. The ability to drag fringe ideas and theories into mainstream political discourse has long been a hallmark of X, even back when it was known as Twitter. There’s always been a trade-off with the platform’s ability to narrow the distance between activists and people in positions of power. Social-justice movements such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter owe some of the success of their early organizing efforts to the platform. Yet the website has also been one of the most reliable mainstream destinations on the internet to see Photoshopped images of public figures (or their family members) in gas chambers, or crude, racist cartoons of Jewish men. Now, under Musk’s stewardship, X seems to run in only one direction. The platform eschews healthy conversation. It abhors nuance, instead favoring constant escalation and engagement-baiting behavior. And it empowers movements that seek to enrage and divide. In April, an NBC News investigation found that “at least 150 paid ‘Premium’ subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months.” According to research from the extremism expert Colin Henry, since Musk’s purchase, there’s been a decline in anti-Semitic posts on 4chan’s infamous “anything goes” forum, and a simultaneous rise in posts targeting Jewish people on X. X’s own transparency reports show that the social network has allowed hateful content to flourish on its site. In its last report before Musk’s acquisition, in just the second half of 2021, Twitter suspended about 105,000 of the more than 5 million accounts reported for hateful conduct. In the first half of 2024, according to X, the social network received more than 66 million hateful-conduct reports, but suspended just 2,361 accounts. It’s not a perfect comparison, as the way X reports and analyzes data has changed under Musk, but the company is clearly taking action far less frequently. Read: I’m running out of ways to explain how bad this is Because X has made it more difficult for researchers to access data by switching to a paid plan that prices out many academics, it is now difficult to get a quantitative understanding of the platform’s degradation. The statistics that do exist are alarming. Research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that in just the first month of Musk’s ownership, anti–Black American slurs used on the platform increased by 202 percent. The Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic tweets on the platform increased by 61 percent in just two weeks after Musk’s takeover. But much of the evidence is anecdotal. The Washington Post summed up a recent report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, noting that pro-Hitler content “reached the largest audiences on X [relative to other social-media platforms], where it was also most likely to be recommended via the site’s algorithm.” Since Musk took over, X has done the following: None of this is accidental. The output of a platform tells you what it is designed to do: In X’s case, all of this is proof of a system engineered to give voice to hateful ideas and reward those who espouse them. If one is to judge X by its main exports, then X, as it exists now under Musk, is a white-supremacist website. You might scoff at this notion, especially if you, like me, have spent nearly two decades willingly logged on to the site, or if you, like me, have had your professional life influenced in surprising, occasionally delightful ways by the platform. Even now, I can scroll through the site’s algorithmic pond scum and find things worth saving—interesting commentary, breaking news, posts and observations that make me laugh. But these exceptional morsels are what make the platform so insidious, in part because they give cover to the true political project that X now represents and empowers. As I was preparing to write this story, I visited some of the most vile corners of the internet. I’ve monitored these spaces for years, and yet this time, I was struck by how little distance there was between them and what X has become. It is impossible to ignore: The difference between X and a known hateful site such as Gab are people like myself. The majority of users are no doubt creators, businesses, journalists, celebrities, political junkies, sports fans, and other perfectly normal people who hold their nose and cling to the site. We are the human shield of respectability that keeps Musk’s disastrous $44 billion investment from being little more than an algorithmically powered Stormfront. The justifications—the lure of the community, the (now-limited) ability to bear witness to news in real time, and of the reach of one’s audience of followers—feel particularly weak today. X’s cultural impact is still real, but its promotional use is nonexistent. (A recent post linking to a story of mine generated 289,000 impressions and 12,900 interactions, but only 948 link clicks—a click rate of roughly 0.00328027682 percent.) NPR, which left the platform in April 2023, reported almost negligible declines in traffic referrals after abandoning the site. Continuing to post on X has been indefensible for some time. But now, more than ever, there is no good justification for adding one’s name to X’s list of active users. To leave the platform, some have argued, is to cede an important ideological battleground to the right. I’ve been sympathetic to this line of thinking, but the battle, on this particular platform, is lost. As long as Musk owns the site, its architecture will favor his political allies. If you see posting to X as a fight, then know it is not a fair one. For example: In October, Musk shared a fake screenshot of an Atlantic article, manipulated to show a fake headline—his post, which he never deleted, garnered more than 18 million views. The Atlantic’s X post debunking Musk’s claim received just 28,000 views. Musk is unfathomably rich. He’s used that money to purchase a platform, take it private, and effectively turn it into a megaphone for the world’s loudest racists. Now he’s attempting to use it to elect a corrupt, election-denying felon to the presidency. To stay on X is not an explicit endorsement of this behavior, but it does help enable it. I’m not at all suggesting—as Musk has previously alleged—that the site be shut down or that Musk should be silenced. But there’s no need to stick around and listen. Why allow Musk to appear even slightly more credible by lending our names, our brands, and our movements to a platform that makes the world more dangerous for real people? To my dismay, I’ve hid from these questions for too long. Now that I’ve confronted them, I have no good answers.

Title: Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era

Brendan Mullin (61), who has been found guilty on 12 charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from Bank of Ireland Private Bank when he was its managing director a decade ago, was one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era. Born in Jerusalem, he was educated at Blackrock College, which he captained to a Schools Senior Cup success, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the final against King’s Hospital. He was also twice the senior boys All Ireland 110m hurdles champion (1980-1981). Mullin studied Law at Dublin University while representing Trinity at rugby. He also played club rugby with Blackrock College and London Irish. Mullin then headed for Oxford University, where he won a “Blue” playing in the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. Having represented Leinster and Ireland at schools’ level, he graduated to the senior ranks for province and country. He made his Ireland debut against the Grand Slam-winning Australia side in November 1984, a losing start as the home side went down 16-9, but there was better fortune around the corner as he was part of Mick Doyle’s Triple Crown and championship winning side (1985) in his rookie Test season. Mullin scored his first Irish try in that campaign, where he blocked down England fullback Chris Martin’s kick and regathered to dot down. An elegant centre with blistering pace and an underappreciated kicking game, he played alongside some very talented three-quarters in Irish backlines such as Simon Geoghegan, Dave Curtis, Jim Staples, Michael Kiernan, Keith Crossan, Trevor Ringland and Hugo MacNeill. [ Ex-rugby international Brendan Mullin found guilty of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from bankOpens in new window ] A member of the Ireland squad for the first-ever World Cup in 1987, Mullin was subsequently selected for the 1989 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia under head coach Ian McGeechan, one of four Irish players in the original touring party, alongside Paul Dean, Steve Smith and Donal Lenihan, and played well enough to win a place in the first Test against the Wallabies, playing alongside Mike Hall (Wales). Mullin broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991 The Lions were thrashed 30-12, and among the changes for the final two Tests, both of which the Lions won to claim the series 2-1, was a new centre partnership of Scott Hastings and Jerry Guscott. Mullin did play another Test for the Lions, against France later that year, to celebrate the bicentenary of the French Revolution. He broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991, and later that year was part of the Ireland team that suffered a narrow World Cup quarter-final defeat at Lansdowne Road to the eventual champions, Australia. By the time he retired from rugby – he came back to play in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, having been out of international rugby for two years, and retired for good after the quarter-final defeat to France, the last of his 55 Irish caps – Mullin had added another two tries to push the new Irish record to 17, a milestone that he retained for a dozen years until broken by Brian O’Driscoll. [ Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur eraOpens in new window ] The former Ireland captain eclipsed the mark when he scored his 18th Irish try against Italy in Rome (2003) on his 35th cap, 20 fewer than it took Mullin, who sent O’Driscoll a congratulatory note and a signed jersey from that final cap against France in the 1995 World Cup. He said in a subsequent interview when asked about losing the record to O’Driscoll: “No regrets at all. It’s a milestone. It was something I was very proud to hold on to for a while, but it’s something to be broken. Many more players will break that milestone and that’s good for Irish rugby, while Brian will go on to score many more tries.” Mullin is due to be sentenced on November 25th.

Title: British Pension Fund Joins Bitcoin Rush, Invests 3% Of Its Total Assets In BTC

In a major adoption boost for Bitcoin, a United Kingdom-based pension fund has added the bellwether crypto to its balance sheet — marking the first move of its kind in the nation. According to pension advisory firm Cartwright, the undisclosed fund made a 3% allocation to the apex cryptocurrency. Pensions specialist Cartwright announced Monday that it had successfully guided an unnamed client in the UK to make a considerable investment into Bitcoin. In October, the client in question allocated 3% of its £50 million ($65 million) to BTC after “lengthy consultations with the scheme’s trustees, where ESG, investment case, and security were all addressed at length,” Glenn Cameron, head of digital assets at Cartwright told Corporate Advisor. What makes this investment particularly noteworthy is that the pension fund is actually investing in Bitcoin itself rather than a proxy such as a spot BTC ETF. The report reveals that the private key is divided between five separate institutions. Cartwright said it had made the recommendation owing to Bitcoin’s long-term returns. According to CoinGecko data, the top crypto has soared by almost 100,000% since 2013. According to Sam Roberts, the firm’s director of investment consulting, Bitcoin is well suited to the scheme’s 10-year investment horizon. “Trustees are increasingly looking for innovative solutions to future-proof their schemes in the face of economic challenges,” Roberts posited. This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” Roberts further said he hoped the “strategic move” would be emulated by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he declared, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright further stated that it anticipates institutional Bitcoin adoption to be similar to when pension schemes started purchasing equities in the 1970s. It might be painfully slow at first, but then, ultimately, it would become a bad idea not to allocate the asset to a portfolio. Cameron also believes that Bitcoin’s unique asymmetric return profile indicates that even a small allocation can considerably improve financial performance. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has skyrocketed across the globe, specifically in the United States, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic greenlighting of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These novel investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through stock-like shares on regulated exchanges without the hassle of storing the asset. The funds were introduced by Wall Street giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, and have so far collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC — fast closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s stack.

Title: Michigan Becomes First State Pension Fund To Invest In Ethereum ETFs With $10 Million Buy

The State of Michigan Retirement System has disclosed a new holding in Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund, becoming the first public pension fund to do so since the ETH-based product commenced trading on U.S. exchanges in July. This strategic move marks a huge step for institutional investment in crypto assets, as the Michigan Retirement System manages roughly $13.6 billion in pension fund assets for state employees. In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Michigan’s pension fund revealed it has scooped up 460,000 shares in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), valued at approximately $10.07 million, along with an additional 1.1 million worth of shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). According to VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Michigan has now become one of the top five holders of Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE. What’s more interesting is that the Michigan pension fund now owns more Ether than Bitcoin, despite the latter being greenlighted by the securities regulator several months in advance. The move sets Michigan apart as most state pension funds focus mostly on Bitcoin investments. As revealed in its latest SEC filing, the Michigan pension fund continues to hold its Bitcoin investment with 110,000 shares in the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF, worth roughly $7 million. “Not only did Michigan’s pension buy ether ETFs, but they bought more than they did of Bitcoin ETFs, $10 million vs $7 million, this despite BTC being up a ton and ether in the gutter,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posited in a post on X. “Pretty big win for ether, which could use one.” Following the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, institutional investors have become more comfortable with dipping their toes into the fast-growing asset class. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board made a trailblazing move by picking up a $100 million investment in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund issued by investment giant BlackRock. Notably, Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis recently sent a letter requesting a report on considering Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable investments for state pension funds. This move signals that more and more states are now eyeing crypto as a viable investment for pension funds.

Group plans to buy company behind Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare Frank Keane also operates Volkswagen dealerships in Dublin Frank Keane Motors plans to buy company behind Co Kildare BMW dealership BMW. Photo: Getty Frank Keane Motors – a BMW dealership for almost 60 years – is planning to buy Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare in a deal that’s likely to be worth well in excess of €20m. If approved by the competition watchdog, it will create a group with turnover easily exceeding €300m a year. Frank Keane Motors has just notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) that it intends to buy the entire issued share capital of Pavla Unlimited in Naas. Both companies sell new and used cars and are BMW dealerships, with Conlon & Sons selling the eponymous marque as well as Mini, Jaguar and Land Rover. Frank Keane Motors also sells Volkswagen vehicles and light commercial vehicles. It is also a wholesale distributor of FUSO trucks and MG passenger cars. Today's News in 90 Seconds - November 6th Recent company filings for Pavla – controlled by Ray and Nicholas Conlon - show that last month it issued shares valued at almost €23m to a company called Bonaghmore Holdings. Pavla was only incorporated during the summer. Bonaghmore Holdings is in turn owned by a company called Gledstanes, which was also set up during the summer. The most recent set of publicly available accounts for Bonaghmore Holdings show that it generated sales of €84.8m in the 12 months to the end of August 2023, up from €71.4m a year earlier. The company made a €6.1m pre-tax profit in the 2023 financial year, which compared with almost €6.9m in the previous year. It had shareholder funds of €41.5m at the end of the 2023 financial year. Frank Keane Group is unlimited and does not have to file publicly available accounts. However, its turnover is likely to be north of €250m a year. Founded in 1967, it was awarded the BMW franchise for Ireland that year. It now employs about 300 people. It operates a BMW dealership on the Naas Road in Dublin as well as one on Blackrock in the capital’s southside. It also has a Mini dealership on the Nass Road. The firm has two Volkswagen dealerships, both of which are in Dublin. The CCPC said submissions from third parties in relation to the proposed acquisition of Pavla Unlimited are due by December 13 as part of its preliminary investigation in the deal.

Title: Investor Anthony Pompliano Calls Bitcoin ‘Gold With Wings,’ Says BTC the Savings Account of the New Generation

Longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano believes that the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) is gold on steroids. In a new interview on Fox Business, the founder of venture capital firm Pomp Investments says that the debasement of the US dollar is bullish for both Bitcoin and gold, but the flagship crypto asset could outperform the precious metal due to increasing adoption. “If you look at gold and the S&P 500 over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate is about the same. Gold is up 13% and the S&P is up 14%. Bitcoin has destroyed that. And so I like to say that Bitcoin is gold with wings. Bitcoin and gold both go up for the same reason. They’re debasing the dollar. But Bitcoin is much more sensitive. It’s an earlier asset that the world is trying to price in. What’s very unique about Bitcoin is that it’s a bottom-up story. Most technology goes top-down. Militaries and governments, they adopt it first, then corporations and then finally individuals. They get a smartphone or they get a computer on their desk. They’re the last ones. Bitcoin was the opposite. The individuals got it first. Now we’re seeing corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity start to adopt this. Eventually, it’s going to be central banks and it is going to be governments. Central banks today own 12% of the global gold supply. I believe that they will eventually start to buy Bitcoin. That would be very bullish for the price of Bitcoin.” He also believes that people will increasingly store their wealth in stablecoins and Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank account. “If you think of the traditional financial system, you have a checking account, you got a savings account. That checking account is being replaced by stablecoins. It’s just dollars in a digital rail. Bitcoin is becoming that savings account and the beauty of a savings account is you put your money there and you don’t move it. So if you go and you look on-chain, you can see that more than one out of every two Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years, and two out of every three Bitcoin has not moved in the last 12 months even though Bitcoin’s price has tripled during that time period.” Bitcoin is trading for $67,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.
