By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors flooded U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target Chinese markets with $5.2 billion in new assets in the past week when mainland China's financial markets were shut for a national holiday, and some asset managers are hopeful the optimism will be enduring. The influx came after an initial package of stimulus measures from Beijing that included interest rate cuts and changes to bank liquidity requirements was announced in late September, which culminated on Sept. 30 in the largest one-day rally that Chinese stocks have seen since 2008. Tuesday is the first working day in China after a run of holidays over the past week, and senior officials from China's top economic planning agency are expected to give information on steps to implement policies to promote economic growth. China's measures have driven some optimism that the support will sustain and extend the dramatic turnaround in investor sentiment. The $5.2 billion inflow for the week ended Oct. 4 compares to an average weekly outflow of $83 million to date in 2024, and an average weekly outflow of $27 million last year, according to data from Morningstar. "The market has been waiting for a credible commitment from China to get its economy going again," said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust, a Philadelphia-based boutique wealth management firm. "Now we need to see follow-through." Authorities also have announced plans to boost their investment in domestic ETFs. China's Securities Regulatory Commission announced plans in late September to rapidly approve new ETFs that would track China's "Star Market," a segment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange dedicated to technology companies, and direct more capital to ETFs based in mainland China, according to the Financial Times. "The China markets have been so oversold," said Jonathan Krane, founder and CEO of KraneShares. His firm's flagship ETF, KraneShares CSI China Internet, pulled in $1.39 billion in new assets last week alone, putting year-to-date flows back in the black, according to Morningstar. The $8.3 billion KraneShares ETF is just one of more than two dozen China-focused funds that posted double-digit one-week returns, gaining between 10% and 28% and outperforming the more than 3,000 other ETFs traded in the U.S. market last week, according to Paris-based data analytics firm TrackInsight. Krane believes the surge in share prices is just the start, as investors have low exposure to Chinese stocks after February's outsize nosedive by the benchmark CSI 300 Index, itself a reaction to growing fears about everything from a real estate slump, lackluster economic data, deflation and geopolitical events. "This is just a very small percentage of the world getting back in or saying I need to rethink China," Krane added. "This was just the early money." The vast majority of money in the past week has flowed into the biggest ETFs that offer broad exposure to a range of large-cap Chinese stocks. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s $7.99 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF saw inflows of $2.7 billion last week, according to Morningstar. "When you see moves that are so vast and violent, you see money flow into these (index-linked) products first," said Michael Barrer, head of ETF capital markets for asset management firm Matthews Asia. Still, assets in the $44.8 million Matthews China Active ETF have soared in the wake of net inflows of $11.7 million last week. For Chinese-focused ETFs to hang on to the new assets, Beijing will need to announce a package of detailed and high-impact reforms, said Jason Hsu, founder and CEO of Rayliant Global Advisors, an asset management firm. "The next bazooka that Beijing fires has to come in the shape of formalizing new stimulus proposals and adding a timeline," he said. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza said he saw the tide turning in investor sentiment. Roundhill launched Roundhill China Dragons ETF last week, focusing on nine of what Roundhill deems the largest, most innovative Chinese technology firms. It attracted net inflows of $35 million in its first two trading days, Mazza said. "We figured that at some point soon, the tide would turn and China once again would be investable," Mazza said.

Title: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why

BlackRock’s stance on cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—has lately made headlines. While Ethereum is considered as a “technology bet,” the investment behemoth sees Bitcoin as a “gold alternative.” This point of view captures a major change in the way conventional finance is starting to welcome digital assets. The company’s findings show that people are becoming more and more sure that Bitcoin can protect against inflation, just like gold has in the past. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, recently said that Bitcoin is appealing to investors who want to protect their wealth in uncertain economic times because there is a limited quantity. Many investors who are growingly concerned about market volatility and inflation will find resonance in this mindset. For those looking for stability in the realm of finance, gold has traditionally been the preferred asset. BlackRock contends, though, that Bitcoin is filling in this function. As the company points out, Bitcoin’s limited supply and spread-out nature could make it a more interesting purchase than gold. Central banks around the world are printing money at rates that have never been seen before. This makes Bitcoin an even better way to save money. “More institutional investors entering the market will only speed up the acceptance of Bitcoin at an incredible rate,” says Rieder. With this new money coming in, demand will grow even faster, making Bitcoin even more of a digital gold standard. Additionally, BlackRock believes that with increased realization of worth and scarcity, the price of the blockchain will keep moving upwards. BlackRock considers Bitcoin a “risk-off” asset like gold. At a recent conference, BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin might hedge against fiat currencies and government trust. Mitchnick said Bitcoin is a safe shelter for investors, especially during economic turmoil. As inflation, monetary devaluation, and banking crises develop, Bitcoin’s potential as a worldwide monetary alternative makes it important for financial security. Although Ethereum is seen via another perspective, Bitcoin attracts attention as a store of value. BlackRock sees Ethereum as a platform for innovation as much as a cryptocurrency. With its smart contract capability, developers may create decentralized apps (dApps), therefore transforming many sectors, including gaming and banking. Ethereum has great future potential. Ethereum demand may explode as more companies investigate blockchain technology. The analysts of BlackRock are positive about Ethereum’s future and indicate that its core technology might cause rapid increase in the coming years. With BlackRock continuing to invest in these types of cryptocurrencies, that spells massive influence for the financial market. The general financial market is responding in such a trend, with old-time investors now becoming conscious of the potential attached to such digital assets.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Global Crypto Fund Outflows Hit $147M—Here’s What’s Driving Investors Away

The latest report from CoinShares, a crypto asset manager, has revealed that digital asset investment products experienced a notable shift last week as $147 million in net outflows were recorded globally, ending a three-week streak of inflows. CoinShares revealed that this ended inflow streak isn’t ordinary, as it results from a notable trend in the macroeconomic space. According to CoinShares, the sudden outflow seen last week impacted major asset managers, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, following nearly $2 billion in net inflows over the prior three weeks. The outflows were largely led by Bitcoin-based funds, which accounted for $159 million in net outflows. In contrast, short-Bitcoin investment products attracted $2.8 million in net inflows, indicating that some investors are betting on a further downward price movement for the asset. Ethereum-based products, on the other hand, which had just ended five weeks of outflows the previous week, resumed their negative trend, recording net outflows of $28.9 million. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained this was due to a “lackluster” investor interest in the asset. This indicates that while Ethereum had briefly stabilized in the eyes of investors, confidence in its performance has not been fully restored, resulting in continued outflows. Meanwhile, multi-asset investment products, which provide diversified exposure across a range of cryptocurrencies, went against the overall trend by attracting net inflows of $29.4 million. This marked the 16th consecutive week of positive flows for these products, with $431 million flowing into multi-asset funds since June. Butterfill noted that these products have gained popularity among investors who favor a diversified approach, representing roughly 10% of assets under management (AUM) at global crypto fund managers. Furthermore, regarding region, the largest negative flows were concentrated in funds based in the US, Germany, and Hong Kong, which lost $209 million, $8.3 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. However, these losses were partly offset by net inflows into products based in Canada and Switzerland, which saw inflows of $43 million and $34.9 million. Notably, the change in market sentiment, which resulted in millions of outflows, has been linked to stronger-than-expected economic data. James Butterfill, attributing the market reversal to this unexpected economic data, wrote in the report: Higher than expected economic data last week, reducing the probabilities for significant rate cuts are the likely reason for the weaker sentiment amongst investors. Butterfill added alongside these broader economic developments, noting: Trading volumes were up marginally by 15% to US$10 for the week in ETP investment products, while we have seen lower volumes in broader crypto markets.

by Rhoda Wilson | Oct 7, 2024 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Daily Exposé. Hurricane Helene which hit North Carolina on 25 September and was the second worst hurricane since Katrina, dumped 40 trillion gallons of water in a short amount of time, causing unprecedented flooding and mudslides, with the water having nowhere to go. The flooding has caused widespread devastation, with whole towns being washed away and over a million people still without power in North Carolina and South Carolina. Corporate media has been reporting a relatively low number of affected people, but the reality on the ground is much more severe. As one independent media report described it, the situation is “unprecedented” and “apocalyptic,” with many people experiencing flooding and devastation on a scale never seen before. Was Hurricane Helene caused by weather manipulation so the Government could grab the land from citizens? If so, why? As Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin wrote: “Untold potential for riches are there for the taking in the mountains of Appalachia. The Americans living in the mountains are the only barrier. Murder always happens for a reason.” On Saturday, Truthstream Media published a report about Hurricane Helene. Thousands of people are missing in the flood-ridden areas of Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, and it may take a while to determine the actual number of people alive or dead. Many people in the affected areas are currently without power, clean water, food, fuel, medicine, and other essential supplies. Many bridges are out, and people are stranded, with some areas only having one way in and one way out, making evacuation difficult. The situation is described as “apocalyptic,” with bodies floating down the river and people having witnessed neighbors dying, leaving many in shock and traumatized. There have been reports of children being found alone in the woods, with their parents nowhere to be found, suggesting that something may have happened to them. Many people are still trapped, and there is no coordinated central location for information on missing people, with citizens taking to social media to share pictures and information about their loved ones. Rescue missions are underway, but there have been reports of people being turned away from donating or volunteering, with some organizations only accepting approved donations. A civilian helicopter pilot was helping to rescue people stranded by the disaster but was threatened with arrest by authorities after landing to pick up an older couple who were waving for help. Many people in North Carolina have lost trust in relief organisations, believing they have been taken over by grifters and liars. Citizens are instead trying to help each other directly, only to be turned away or threatened with arrest by authorities. The federal response to the disaster has been appalling, with President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not making any public statements for four days and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) not being present on the ground. And the Government’s response to the crisis has been slow. President Biden only approved a thousand soldiers on 2 October, days after the emergency declarations were made, even though the affected area is the size of Massachusetts. The initial emergency declarations only covered 11 counties, despite widespread devastation in up to 90 counties. Governor DeSantis of Florida is sending extra aid to North Carolina, while some people feel that their own governor is not doing enough. Today the Independent reported that Florida has been warned that a “once in a lifetime” storm is on its way and Floridians have been asked to brace for what could be the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017. Naturally, questions are being asked as to what’s really happening. The United States government has been able to manipulate the weather since World War II, with the ability to control and even weaponize the weather since the 1960s to prove that the Government had the capability, in the 1970s, the US Congress introduced a bill to regulate weather manipulators, requiring registration and licensing for weather manipulation tools. And suspicions that the Government is attacking its own people for gain using weather warfare is not unfounded. After Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, many people became rich as a result of the destruction, with 80% of the land in New Orleans being destroyed and purchased by property developers. Black residents of New Orleans were forced to leave their homes and land, which were then bought by casinos and property developers, with areas like Point Cadet in East Biloxi, Mississippi, being transformed into tourist destinations. Similar scenarios have played out in other areas, such as Maui Lahaina, where massive wildfires cleared the way for new resorts and tourist developments. Now residents of North Carolina are wondering if the US government had anything to do with the massive hurricane that just destroyed their state. In the video below, the hosts of Redacted, Clayton Morris and Natali Morris, discuss the history of weather manipulation in the United States, weather manipulation and land acquisition, weather warfare during the Cold War, and the recent Hurricane Helene and suspicions of it being the result of weather manipulation. Some believe that the government may be using this technology to control the weather and that the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene may be used as an excuse for the government to seize land and resources through eminent domain, the legal power of the Government to take private property for public use. One of the areas affected by Hurricane Helene is the world’s largest lithium deposit, which is set to be mined by a company that has entered into an agreement with the Department of Defence. By coincidence, BlackRock and Vanguard own the most shares in the lithium mine. The agreement is worth US$99 million and aims to have the mine up and running by 2030, but the area has been devastated by the hurricane, which may allow the government to use eminent domain to seize the land. If the video above is removed from YouTube, you can watch it on Rumble HERE. Appalachia: Murder Always Happens For A Reason “Something evil is going on in the North Carolina mountains” By Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin (primary author Ginger Breggin) It is no less than mass murder. Reports of a complete absence of state or federal assistance in the devastated areas hit by Hurricane Helene are now crowding the social media airwaves. Bodies floating down the rivers. Bodies hanging in trees. Tangled in piles of debris. Utility company linemen are the first into most of the demolished areas. They report finding children as young as three wandering naked in the mud, crying for their parents, some with ropes dangling from where their parents lashed them in desperation to timber. The smell of death is everywhere. About 1 million souls lived in these Western North Carolina counties, with additional souls dying in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee. State and federal authorities have not been on site for the first week or so after the storm dropped like a bomb. There is no update on the number of dead and/or missing, and rescue of those who have survived other than local accounts. A report out of Asheville, the largest flooded-out community in North Carolina, says some FEMA workers have just arrived with porta potties for the local inundated hospital which is still without any electricity or any water. Volunteers, community members, and now some aid workers beginning to trickle in are bringing the dead to the privately owned Mission hospital in Asheville, which is now designated the place to bring bodies into the region. FEMA is quoted as saying they are too tied up at the border and won’t be sending refrigerator trucks for body storage. FEMA also was overheard saying “add a couple zeros” to whatever the body count is right now … One local report on X cites reports of over 900 bodies already at the hospital that haven’t been identified. A report out of Chimney Rock, NC said a “government official” has told residents at a town meeting that the federal government is seizing land, and the entire area will be bulldozed – bodies, still-standing buildings, and all. One local pastor was going door to door with water and found there were so many bodies that they changed their delivery request to body bags. “They are not picking up the bodies. They don’t wanna identify the bodies and they’re just leaving them to rot in the streets.” And “Something evil is going on in the NC mountains.” The disaster region needs pilots with planes, helicopters, people with big equipment, and trucks. The 82nd airborne is still not ordered to participate in the rescue, their Apache helicopters are on the ground waiting for Title 10, the emergency order that is required to activate the 82nd airborne. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) is AWOL (absent without leave). The few FEMA representatives trickling in a week after disaster struck are actively disrupting volunteer efforts. Emergency supplies are being taken from volunteers and locked up, FEMA directs survivors to use non-existent internet or telephones, and some state and federal officials are threatening volunteers and survivors with arrest. Federal relief is reported to be loans – and the contracts required to state if funds are not paid back on time all property may be seized. Unverified reports state North Carolina police have now issued a statement that they will start arresting any federal employees trying to stop or hinder rescue operations, have been debunked. Survivors of the hurricane and the floods are still without power more than a week after the storm and the rains – there is no date for restoration in sight. Food and water are running out or gone and small communities are still cut off. Dehydrated and starving people with no cell phones or other means of communication have been abandoned. A Brannon Howse media interview with the non-profit Aerial Recovery organization confirmed the federal government’s absence and further confirmed that they were told not to conduct search, rescue, and recovery work in both Lake Lure and Chimney Rock when they arrived with former special forces volunteers, equipment, chain saws. The volunteer rescue crew was stopped and ordered to leave by the local police. Elon Musk posted a video of the devastation filmed by some of his Space X engineers flying into North Carolina to deliver Starlink terminals and supplies. Musk said “My blood is boiling” because FEMA would not let the Musk company helicopter land to deliver the critical supplies. Columnist Leo Hohmann reminds us that this region of the US is Trump country: If your house is destroyed and you are literally trying to survive in an atmosphere with little or no food, water and shelter, and your cell service is out, will you be thinking about voting? What if you are fine but you haven’t heard from a family member since the storm hit? You are searching for them, wondering if you will find them dead or alive. Will you be thinking about voting? I don’t think so. So, we have to wonder if this is not only a humanitarian tragedy being left unattended by the federal government but whether it may also be a concentrated voter suppression effort. Most recently the Biden-Harris administration has announced the release of $750 per person in FEMA funds for hurricane victims. Colonel Douglas Macgregor exposed to Tucker Carlson that illegal immigrants coming over the border are being given $2,200 per month. FEMA has been transformed into emergency aid for illegal immigrants, paid for by US taxpayers. Infrastructure is another critical survival matter that is suddenly in short supply. In our last column, we documented the ILA (International Longshoremen’s Association) strike that started over the weekend. Docks across the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf are closed. Steel, heavy equipment, building supplies, and replacement parts for everything from rescue equipment to heavy electrical transformers come in by boat. There is a massive shortage of transformers in the US, with wait times for replacements of up to five years. So those heavy transformers knocked out by the hurricane are not going to be replaced any time soon. North Carolina has over 360 substations out of commission in its Western region. As of 4 October, the striking ILA port workers are returning to work until mid-January after negotiations settled on a wages agreement. But the high voltage transformer shortage will not be remedied anytime soon. In January of 2024, the federal government transferred two high-voltage power transformers to Ukraine to “enhance the reliability of Ukraine’s Integrated Power System and ensure its maintenance during this and following winters.” This was done despite the shortage of that equipment to ensure US electrical grid reliability. Now we are without the backup supply of transformers needed to repair the grid in the damaged part of Western North Carolina. North Carolina lawmaker Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) reported: The flooding provides a unique challenge not previously faced by substations in Western North Carolina …There is a high likelihood that the substations are not repairable, and replacement of the substation equipment will be necessary. Latitude Media, covering energy news, reported: Many substations [in Western NC] are reportedly completely flooded, leaving Duke Energy, the investor-owned utility that serves the region, unable to accurately assess the damage until the waters recede and the bulky equipment can be dried. Replacement, however, is a tall order. The disaster is coming in the midst of a shortage of electrical equipment, and especially of the transformers that substations use to switch power voltage from direct current to alternating current, or vice versa. As electricity demand across the US increases, so does demand for the equipment that renewable projects, electric vehicle chargers, and countless other things depend upon. And manufacturers are already at capacity – and expanding it further is made challenging by a tight labour market. Transformer prices have risen over 60% since 2020. The idea that some of the lightly populated regions of the heavily forested mountain region of North Carolina might not be rebuilt begins to make a diabolical kind of sense. The United States used to know how to do rescue. I wrote about traditional American rescue activities and contrasted them with the lack of assistance during the Maui/Lahaina “wildfire.” That signaled a blatant, unhidden disregard for the fundamental decency, traditions, and values of Western civilization: Americans Know What to Do When Disaster Strikes Americans know what to do when disasters hit. We have been doing rescue, survival, and restoration for as long as we have had communities, from the first small outposts dotting the East Coast to the spread and growth of towns and cities across this amazing land. We know how to “do” rescue. Many of us learned in our youth, during Scouts or other volunteer organisations. Many of us have served in the armed forces, as EMTs or police, or as a member of volunteer fire departments, or we have had training in CPR and first aid. My father was a member of the ski patrol in its infancy, in New York State. Now, most communities and certainly most regions have established Red Cross offices. Rescue begins when an alarm goes up. There is a fire, a tornado, a hurricane, a flood or some other disaster. People gather to help stem the damage, set up a central meeting place, start keeping a list of survivors (and those lost), gather supplies to sustain everyone, comfort the stricken and start the clean-up and the restoration. Temporary housing is arranged, care for children is established and the beginnings of a return to normalcy occur amidst the comforting of those who have been through the traumatic experience and loss of family, friends, community and home. This is not your Granddaddy’s rescue anymore. The burning question is why? “Never let a serious crisis go to waste” was known as Rahm’s rule. Rahm Emanual was chief of staff to President-elect Barack Obama when he issued that famous declaration. So, we ask what can be done with this massive disaster. We have touched upon the first action – condemn the lightly populated portions of North Carolina including the damaged electrical infrastructure meant to service the area. Suddenly the need for transformers is lessened. However, eliminating the need to replace key electrical grid infrastructure is only the beginning. There is so much more benefit to be gained by emptying these mountains of the American citizens who have lived and worked there. Some of the richest lithium sources in the world are located in Western North Carolina. Two lithium mines already exist in the mountainous region of Western North Carolina. Albemarle Kings Mountain is one mining operation and is touted as one of the world’s most advanced lithium material sites. They describe their mining as a lithium ecosystem: The Kings Mountain, North Carolina, site represents Albemarle’s mine-to-market strategy, encompassing all elements of the lithium ecosystem needed to power everything from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to life-saving medical devices … The Kings Mountain site has one of the world’s richest lithium depositions, representing an essential part of the global clean energy transformation. Albemarle Corporation has been working hard to resume open pit mining at the Kings Mountain site which has been idled since the early 1990s. The Department of Defence (“DoD”), entered into a $90 million agreement in September 2023. The funds are earmarked to help support “Albemarle’s planned re-opening of their Kings Mountain, N.C. lithium mine to increase domestic production of lithium for the nation’s battery supply chain.” BlackRock Inc. wants a bigger piece of the mine, too. The largest investment firm in the world, BlackRock, increased its ownership in Albermarle Corp by buying over 2 million shares on 31 August 2024, less than a month before Hurricane Helene hit the mountains. The coincidences just keep piling up. Piedmont Lithium’s North Carolina operation is located 30 miles west of Charlotte in Gaston County. Piedmont Lithium has interests in Tennessee, North Carolina, Ghana, and Canada but “industry headwinds are causing major changes at the startup company.” The term headwinds means in layperson, making company growth more difficult. The company had much higher and active value until mid-2023 when it ran into local opposition and was having trouble with expansion plans in Tennessee. But in August 2024, they scrapped their proposed processing facility in Etowah, Tennessee, and they will now be “incorporated into the company’s proposed Carolina Lithium project, covering a 1,548-acre tract in Gaston County.” The company declared “Carolina Lithium is one of only two significant projects in the US Based on published technical studies, we expect Carolina Lithium to be a low-cost producer … and a key contributor to US energy security.” Their mining permit was just finalized in May of 2024 after the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources approved the permit application in April 2024. Hurricane Helene has arrived just in time to clear out the property owners local to the mining interests in Western North Carolina. Piedmont Lithium was heavily opposed in Gaston County by local residents and commissioners. But now it appears the opposition has been eliminated. Two quartz mines in Spruce Pine, NC produce “the world’s purest quartz, which formed in the area some 380 million years ago. The material is a key component in the global supply chain for semiconductor chips, which power everything from smartphones and cars to medical devices and solar panels.” According to the two companies, Siblelco and The Quartz Corp, that separately manage the two mines, they are making strides in getting their mines up and running again. The largest delay may be the specialized workers most of whom have been displaced by the storm and floods. Semiconductor manufacturers may run into extended delays until these two mines are up and running once again. CNN Business reports: “You’re building these incredibly complicated chips that have, in some cases, 100 billion transistors, 100 billion tiny little machines, on a chip that is the size of your thumbnail … One atom being out of place could mean a defect that breaks the chip,” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Centre for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. And while quartz is abundant around the world, the kind of ultra-high-purity quartz mined in Spruce Pine is not. The Spruce Pine mines provide an estimated 80% to 90% of the world’s high-purity quartz – experts say the exact amount is proprietary and unknown – supplying semiconductor manufacturers like chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Other quartz sources in the US and around the world require purification processes that are time-consuming and far inferior to the special quartz found, so far, at these two mines in North Carolina. The mines are considered a national strategic asset. I have discovered another company in the same affected region – Land & Mineral Company – Gusher Knob which is currently developing joint venture and extraction partners to begin mining the Gusher Knob land tract containing another ultra-high purity quartz deposit. I expect their business will pick up rapidly now in the wake of property damage from Hurricane Helene. Asheville, NC is the largest town in the damaged reason and it has suffered grave damage too, as we’ve reported above. There have been plans going back over eight years to convert Asheville into a Smart City. Because of the damage including lack of electricity and water, the opportunity now presents itself to implement the smart city plans for Asheville. Because of its size, Asheville may survive and become the regional hub for the future plans of Western North Carolina. The Federal government can seize land. The power of eminent domain, explained as the seizure of private property for public use, has been exercised for a variety of reasons over the decades. Expanding rail and roadways, creating parks and many other reasons have been used to seize land. There is a legal requirement that the landowner be compensated “fairly.” The technique of condemnation cases was acknowledged by the Supreme Court and has been used to appropriate property for public uses from the establishment of a post office to the building of a railroad. The ‘History of the Federal Use of Eminent Domain’ describes the legal issues and development of this federal law. Rock Creek Park, running through Washington DC and into Maryland, was developed using eminent domain. I have touched on the growing demand and national security significance for globally scarce lithium and precious quartz, both of which have traditionally been mined in this region. But there is an even greater value, at least to the federal government over time, in this great swath of the Appalachians to those who wish to embrace globalist values enshrined in the United Nations 2030 and 2050 Goals. I do not embrace globalism, as it has demonstrated an utter disregard for individual sovereignty, freedoms, Constitutional values and basic American rights. But the Biden/Harris US administration has completely embraced globalism, doing all that it can to increase the US globalist transformation. The UN has established a Global Biodiversity Framework that calls for a 2050 goal of all ecosystem integrity being advanced, with “an increase of at least 15% in the area, connectivity and integrity of natural ecosystems, supporting healthy and resilient populations of all species …” In layman’s language, this means people are no more important than “all” species and non-humans, i.e. natural ecosystems need to be expanded. In other words, remove the human influence on the region. The International Institute for Sustainability (“IIS”) is “a Brazilian private non-profit organization whose mission is to develop transformative solutions for a sustainable world, based on Science [sic] and other forms of knowledge.” The IIS partners with the UN and other international biodiversity organizations and has organized the Nature Map Explorer that identifies and maps a huge quantity of information about terrestrial habitats, human impact, species richness, biomass carbon density, and more, along with the areas of global significance for conservation. One of the richest areas of “global significance for conservation” in the US is the exact region of Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that has been devastated by Hurricane Helene. It appears from rumors coming out of Chimney Rock and surrounding areas that a condemnation seizure is ongoing. Brutal, illegal, immoral and downright evil in the abandonment of the local citizens – but I have also seen this in Lahaina on Maui before and there is a long history of eminent domain. The lands in Western North Carolina already have several state and federal parks and forest lands, and if many of the communities are now abandoned or condemned, nature could be encouraged to regenerate in the region, just as is hypothesized in government and academic papers. If the mountain area is returned to the wild and becomes unpopulated by humans, the future owners of the land – federal or state governments and their agents – will have reclaimed a natural forest wilderness that becomes a powerful carbon sink, which absorbs more carbon than it produces. Owners of carbon sinks can become part of the formal carbon exchange which allows companies that produce a lot of carbon (say in their manufacturing business or their operation) to buy credits offsetting their excess carbon. The forest terrain itself becomes a kind of commodity exchangeable for money. For example, a reforestation project that involves planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can produce carbon credits based on the amount of carbon that the trees sequester over time. Once a third party verifies these projects, the resulting carbon credits can then be sold to individuals or companies seeking to offset their emissions. I expect a few specialized, high-value mines will be able to co-exist in such an environment. The State of North Carolina, the US federal government, the mining industries, the future carbon credit investors, academics, and environmental non-profits will be able to profit from the damage done by the historic hurricane Helene. In a forthcoming column, I will be examining the weather conditions and control that steered this massive, once-in-a-thousand-year storm directly to the Appalachians. For the rest of us, the citizens, the regular folks. There are just too many of us, and depopulation is underway. But we refuse to give up on the plans of the global predators. We urge citizens everywhere to work with their local counties, their municipalities, their counties, and their states to preserve individual liberties, freedoms, and property rights. Work with your federal Congressmen and Senators also but focus especially on all your local representatives. May God protect us all against the diabolical carelessness and cruelty of our captured governments.

Title: One Of The Most Important Substances In The World Comes From An Area Of North Carolina Devastated By Hurricane Helene

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Did you know that a little town in the mountains of North Carolina is the primary worldwide producer of a substance that makes our modern high tech way of life possible? Without the ultra-pure natural quartz that comes from Spruce Pine, North Carolina we would not have the ultra-sophisticated electronic gadgets that we enjoy so much and the global economy would collapse. So is it just a coincidence that Spruce Pine was absolutely devastated by Hurricane Helene? The two facilities that produce this ultra-pure natural quartz in Spruce Pine are both shut down at this point… Two North Carolina facilities that manufacture the high-purity quartz used for making semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables have been shut down by Hurricane Helene with no reopening date in sight. Sibelco and The Quartz Corp both shut down operations in the Appalachian town of Spruce Pine on Thursday ahead of the storm that swept away whole communities in the western part of the state and across the border in East Tennessee. The town is home to mines that produce some of the world’s highest quality quartz. Hopefully these facilities will be able to open again before the end of the year, because they are absolutely critical to the global economy. According to ABC News, it is estimated that somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of all crucibles that are used to make silicon chips worldwide are made out of natural quartz from Spruce Pine… “To make silicon chips, you need to first melt down a highly-purified material called polysilicon. That can only be done in crucibles that are themselves made of a material so pure it will not react chemically with the polysilicon and is also able to withstand enormous heat,” he said. “The best material for those crucibles is ultra-pure quartz. Spruce Pine is the source of the purest natural quartz ever found on Earth.” An estimated 70-90% of the crucibles used worldwide are made from Spruce Pine quartz, he said. Without this natural quartz from Spruce Pine, our way of life would change dramatically. The following comes from a Wired article entitled “The Ultra-Pure, Super-Secret Sand That Makes Your Phone Possible”… The wooded mountains surrounding it, though, are rich in all kinds of desirable rocks, some valued for their industrial uses, some for their pure prettiness. But it’s the mineral in Glover’s bag—snowy white grains, soft as powdered sugar—that is by far the most important these days. It’s quartz, but not just any quartz. Spruce Pine, it turns out, is the source of the purest natural quartz—a species of pristine sand—ever found on Earth. This ultra‑elite deposit of silicon dioxide particles plays a key role in manufacturing the silicon used to make computer chips. In fact, there’s an excellent chance the chip that makes your laptop or cell phone work was made using sand from this obscure Appalachian backwater. “It’s a billion‑dollar industry here,” Glover says with a hooting laugh. “Can’t tell by driving through here. You’d never know it.” This is a really big deal. If the facilities in Spruce Pine are offline for an extended period of time, the entire globe will feel it. Just consider what happened when a fire caused a quartz mine in Spruce Pine to shut down for a brief period of time in 2008… In 2008, a fire in Spruce Pine forced a local quartz mine to halt production, which “all but shut off the supply of high-purity quartz to the world market, sending shivers through the industry.” That fire impacted only one plant—the Unimin Corporation Quartz/Feldspar Plant, which has since been acquired by Sibelco—and its impacts were still felt industry wide. Today, demand for semiconductors is much higher than what it was in 2008 as they’re used to power newer technologies like artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity. Needless to say, what we are facing is far worse than the brief interruption that occurred in 2008. The mountains of North Carolina are also very important to the lithium industry. According to CBNC, a mining operation at Kings Mountain “could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually”… Kings Mountain could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually. The mine sits on one of the world’s richest deposits of spodumene ore, a source of lithium. There is currently only one operational lithium mine in the U.S. in Silver Peak, Nevada, which is owned by Albemarle. Albemarle does not have a precise date for when Kings Mountain will become operational, Norris said. The company is preparing to start the permitting process, which will take two years to complete. Construction will be a multiyear undertaking before the mine is operational, according to the company. Despite local opposition, Albemarle has been aggressively pushing forward with this project. And it turns out that Albemarle was recently given a 90 million dollar grant by the Biden administration… The Biden administration has made setting up a battery supply chain, supported by domestic lithium production and processing, a top priority to end dependence on China, which dominates the global market. Albemarle was awarded a $90 million grant from the Defense Department to support domestic mining, which the company is using to help reopen Kings Mountain. 90 million dollars is a lot of money. So there is a lot riding on the success of this project. Interestingly, BlackRock purchased more than 2 million shares of Albemarle less than 2 months ago… On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc., a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock’s total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle, a key player in the lithium and chemicals industry. The shares were purchased at a price of $90.25 each, marking a strategic addition to BlackRock’s diverse investment portfolio. If you want to understand what is really going on out there, just follow the money. Meanwhile, vast numbers of deeply suffering local residents in the mountains of western North Carolina are still without clean water… Perhaps the greatest irony of Helene is the dire lack of potable water after the floods. The storm completely destroyed Asheville’s water supply system. Water mains and underground pipes were swept away as the ground itself was removed by the torrent. Not a single building in town can access running water, and citizens survive by the thousands of gallons of water being shipped in every day. “We need portable water … nobody can flush their toilets, nobody can take a shower, nobody can do laundry. We have no water and the infrastructure for that water is totally destroyed,” Dr. Carly Brown, a primary care physician in Asheville’s River Arts District, told The Epoch Times. “I haven’t had a shower since last Wednesday. I’m hearing horrible things about [others],” Wendy Feinberg, a 77-year-old retired schoolteacher in Asheville, told The Epoch Times. Many of the communities that have been destroyed by Hurricane Helene will never be rebuilt. We have never seen anything like this, and the federal response to this disaster has been extremely poor. But of course there seems to be plenty of money to send overseas. Just two days ago, Kamala Harris posted the following… The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million. How tone deaf can she possibly be? Enormous numbers of victims in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are not getting the help that they need, but she wants to send 157 million dollars to Lebanon? Is she serious? Sadly, this is just the beginning of the chaos that is coming. More historic natural disasters are on the way, global war will intensify, and the upcoming election will cause a tremendous amount of turmoil. So I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can, because you never know when the next major crisis will strike.

Title: Bitcoin News: Fewer And Fewer People Willing To Sell BTC

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset with a fixed supply, unlike Ethereum, whose supply increases or decreases yearly depending on network use. There will be only 21 million BTC in circulation, and a decent portion, exceeding 4 million, is irrecoverable. Now, recent data shows that fewer and fewer people are willing to part with their BTC. According to on-chain data from the Bitcoin long—and short-term holder supply cycles, less than 10% of holders were eager to sell as of October 2024. This percentage is much lower than the 26% of around mid-2021 and the 64% in 2013. Interestingly, this trend shows that long-term holders, those who bought their coins over six months ago, and short-term holders, or those who bought their BTC in less than 155 days, are willing to let go of their coins. This position is even though Bitcoin, like any other crypto asset, is volatile, posting sharp price gains or dumps over time. To put this position in perspective, Bitcoin is down 15% from its all-time high of March 2024. However, it is also up nearly 150% year-to-date after rising from around $27,000 in October 2023. 2022 Bitcoin prices plunged to below $16,000 after soaring to nearly $70,000 in November 2021. The cyclic nature of Bitcoin isn’t, looking at hard data, dissuading traders who sell whenever prices dump, for example. This shift in trend over the years shows that more holders are positive about the coin’s long-term potential and even as a store of value. There could be multiple factors behind this trend, but among the top is the engagement from institutions, especially after approving the first spot of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States early this year. According to Soso Value, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States manage over $57 billion of BTC. BlackRock controls more than $21.5 billion of user assets, while Grayscale, which is unwinding its GBTC, has seen over $20 billion in outflows since the launch of the derivative product in January. Meanwhile, Adam Buck, the CEO of Blockstream, observes that there are no options–both call and put–that are longer than a year. The CEO adds that this is because most options traders are unwilling to sell their calls since, if they do, most of them will be bought in a flash. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

This week’s Future of Work Summit examines the fallout from Amazon’a RTO push, the challenges of leading through disaster and a conversation about AI and work with Handshake’s Valerie Capers Workman. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Biltmore Village in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on September 29, 2024 in Asheville, North Carolina. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images) October is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious—and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region. Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it’s been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes—while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild. Amid all the chaos is the human cost—and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today’s newsletter about how Amazon’s RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday’s blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake’s chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs. September job growth shattered economists’ predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday. Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike’s impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future. The fallout over Amazon’s decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon’s move as the “canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,” noting “the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration.” Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility. The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. “I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,” Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they’d prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions. Handshake Chief Talent and Engagement Officer Valerie Capers Workman. Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. How is AI changing jobs? I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You’re going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing. What message did you want to share in your book? The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you’re going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both. [“AI skills”] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you’re doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That’s what I’m talking about. If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill? If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: ‘I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.’ Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can’t train you how to think. Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service? That's a great societal question. What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans—that can't be done by A.I.—are the companies that are going to win. We’re hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this? In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. … The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses. Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. … You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in. Last week’s jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall. 176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September’s 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August’s payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively. 83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs “The labor market isn’t on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed.”—​​Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement Here’s how to respond if your employee accuses you of discrimination. Why a lack of female leaders at the top can mirror biases across the organization. Want to establish psychological safety at work?

Title: Bitcoin: 3 key narratives that could influence BTC prices this week

Rising volumes and price gains suggest traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices. Bitcoin [BTC] has traded rangebound between $60,000 and $64,500 in the last seven days. The choppy price movements with no clear trend show a state of market uncertainty. However, BTC could be headed for a volatile week ahead as trading volumes had jumped by 55% at press time per CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin has also gained by 2.5% in 24 hours to trade at $63,435. The rising volumes and price gains suggest that traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices this week. The US Federal Reserve is set to release its minutes for the September monetary policy meeting on 9th October. Last month, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates for the first time since 2020. The September minutes could shed light on possible rate cuts during the November and December meetings. September’s 50-basis point reduction played a role in driving BTC prices last month. Data from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that 97% of investors anticipate that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in November. Source: CME FedWatch Tool A further reduction in interest rates will stir interest in risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, if the Fed minutes show a more dovish stance, it could spur BTC gains. The US inflation data for September is set for release on 10th October. Markets anticipate that the annual inflation rate will come in at 2.3%, a drop from 2.5% reported in August. Additionally, the Core Inflation Rate year-on-year is expected to cool down to 3.1%, a drop from the 3.2% reported in August. The Producer Price Index (PPI), which is also used to predict inflation will be released on 11th October. Economists forecast that the year-on-year PPI data will drop from 1.7% to 1.3%. If the inflation data comes in as expected or falls below expectations, it could drive gains for Bitcoin. On the other hand, if this data comes in hotter than expected, it could lead to Bitcoin’s volatility and cause a drop in prices. $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which is one of the issuers of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will release its quarterly results this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds 367,000 BTC valued at $22 billion. Therefore, the strength of its Q3 earnings could influence prices. JPMorgan will also release its Q3 results later this week, after which it will make 13-F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. In Q2, JPMorgan’s 13-F filing revealed it held $760,000 worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Given that it is the largest US bank, a change in its Bitcoin ETF holdings could drive volatility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 These three narratives are already driving activity in the Bitcoin futures market. BTC’s open interest has increased to the second-highest level this month to $34 million at press time per Coinglass. This increase shows there are more traders opening positions and participating in the market.

AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE of Kildare County Council who was convicted of criminal damage to a property in south Dublin two years ago in a dispute over payment for work has told a court he was a victim of “gross fraud.” Tom McDonnell (62), a self-employed builder and father of five from Lakeside Park, Newbridge, Co Kildare, had been remanded on bail to appear before a sitting of Dún Laoghaire District Court today to address the issue of compensation. However, McDonnell was ordered by Judge Anne Watkin to return again next year with an additional sum of €1,250 to the €1,000 in cash that he had brought to court. The accused, who was elected as an independent member of Kildare County Council in the local elections in June, had been convicted at an earlier court hearing of causing damage to windows at the rear of a house in Rockville Crescent, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 6 September 2022, contrary to Section 2 (1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1991. Counsel for the defendant, John McCoy BL, told Judge Watkin today that the question of compensation was complicated by a related “civil matter.” McCoy pointed out that a claim for damages had been settled by an insurance company for €16,900. However, Judge Watkin pointed out that the injured party had lost a no claims bonus which the court heard had cost him €2,250 this year and an uncertain amount in the future. In response to McCoy’s repeated insistence that his client was unsure what to do because of the uncertainty about the estimate of future losses and the civil matter, the judge retorted: “I don’t think you understand what you are doing here.” She added: “I’m not concerned about the civil matter.” The court heard McDonnell believed that the injured party had already been compensated with a sum that exceeded the damage that was done. Following a brief consultation with his client, McCoy said the defendant was prepared to increase his offer of compensation of €1,000 to the amount of the value of the no claims bonus that had been lost. Judge Watkin pointed out to the barrister that the whole situation had arisen from the position the injured party had been left in by McDonnell. Advertisement Asked to confirm his willingness to pay compensation of €2,250, the defendant said he would but claimed it was “gross fraud.” “I’m owed €23,000. This is fraud,” McDonnell added. The judge observed that McDonnell was accusing his victim of fraud “after what you did to him.” Asked what he was going to do to show remorse, McDonnell said he would require two months to pay the additional amount of compensation. The case was adjourned, with the defendant ordered to appear before a sitting of the same court in January. McDonnell was elected as an independent councillor for the Newbridge local electoral area of Kildare County Council this summer. He received 548 first preference votes which equated to 4.7% of the total valid poll. McDonnell was elected on the 11th and final count to the last of six seats without reaching the quota. The Kildare man is a co-founder of Éire Saor – an unregistered umbrella group of independent candidates who contested the local elections in Kildare on an anti-immigration platform and to oppose planning permission being granted for centres to house international protection applicants. Following his election, McDonnell generated widespread controversy over comments he made in which he claimed Irish people were in danger of dying out because Irish women were not breeding enough. He subsequently expressed regret for his choice of words but explained they were due to his farming background. McDonnell added that he supported tax incentives being given to working women to have more children. In a newspaper interview, he stated his belief that a secret cabal of “Khazarian Jews” are running the world and trying to flood Europe with immigrants as part of a plot to replace Irish people. McDonnell, who is planning to contest the upcoming general election, has denied that he is a far-right politician or anti-immigration but stressed that he was against mass uncontrolled immigration.

MILAN (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has derivative positions in UniCredit equivalent to a 6.7% stake in the Italian bank as of Sept. 30, mostly swap and future contracts as well as call options, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. The position, held through Goldman Sachs International and another nine subsidiaries, if exercised would make the U.S. bank a top investor in UniCredit whose single biggest shareholder is fund manager BlackRock with 7.02%. Filings with Italian market regulator Consob also showed that Barclays holds shares and derivatives as of Sept. 30 in Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which if combined and exercised would give it a 5.3% stake in the lender. The positions are held through Barclays Capital Securities Limited, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. They comprise a voting stake of just 0.92% while another 4.2% is long positions to be settled in shares. (Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Susan Fenton) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Wall Street's hacks and habits to stay on top of their game
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-hacks-that-keep-wall-street-rising-stars-mentally-sharp-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-07T15:44:25Z

Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe's yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. "You're not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It's sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It's no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned cold plunges, 10-step facial rituals, or biohacking trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Most of these high performers featured on Business Insider's 2024 list of rising stars of Wall Street are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and sleep routines, and finding opportunities to recharge. Here's what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He's partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it's regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added. Nina Gnedin, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager from Man Group, starts her day at 4:30 a.m. because she works East Coast market hours. "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There's no day of the year where the sun's down when I'm done with work," she said. Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let's imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock's Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It's a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she's reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. "It's really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That's my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It's about reminding me why I'm here and what it's all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what's about to come and what's ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head. It also works for her way home. Music "helps me reset and decompress and not go to bed with a hamster wheel in my brain," she said. KKR's Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I've been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it's just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we're really close," she added. "That's been a way that I've kept in touch." Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I've never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America's White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you're focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I'm here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Ben Carper, who finished his Padi open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it's a chance to completely unplug. "It's a change of scenery, and it's kind of hard to think about work when there's a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he's eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it's easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo's Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she's become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. "It's a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo's Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson's workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl's daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox, a fitness race featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it's strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I'm a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. "There's some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let's just say 9:30— that's lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I'm on paternity leave, I've been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick's rest so far. "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It's certainly something I have realized as I've matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It's very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, 'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it's just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. "I would say, in general, workaholic or 'Type A' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I'm at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here." Gidan Dan's key ritual at work is consistently staying in touch with his clients, but at home, the Citadel Securities senior vice president takes the chance to relax. "A lot of my colleagues are really good runners and they work out and everything. I'm completely different," he said. "I think I work long enough hours, so I don't want to exhaust myself too much. So I would just go home, and taking care of my kids is enjoyable but exhausting stuff," Dan said of his two daughters, aged 1 and 4. Feroz Khosla, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, isn't just looking for work-life balance, but "work-life harmony — which just means, when you look back at your career, you feel as if there was harmony between work and life," he told BI. "Sometimes, you do need to have the power to say no, but do it gracefully," he said. "Maybe the answer is sure, but not right now—and being able to do that without disappointing people is super helpful." Jump to

Title: Layer raises $6M to make incorruptible foundations of the internet

October 07, 2024 10:00 ET | Source: Layer Layer New York, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A well-functioning internet is something we get to take for granted, thanks to the built-in security protocols carefully designed underneath. Without them, no data could be securely transferred from place to place at the incredible speed required to support the tech industry’s biggest products. Today, the existing security protocols are struggling to protect users from even bigger threats, specifically the threats posed by large companies, cyberattackers, and AI that manipulate our online experience and erode trust. Blockchain technologies, like smart contracts, are a real hope to restore trust in the internet. However, smart contracts can only use a small amount of compute, putting limits on what they can support. To build great user experiences on a trustworthy Decentralized Web, we need a way to verify computations outside of blockchains, and make unstoppable applications that, once released, cannot be tampered with. Recently founded startup Layer aims to extend the functionality of Ethereum by making the first developer tools that support full-stack decentralized applications with Web Assembly. The company has raised a $6M seed round led by 1kx, with participation from Fabric Ventures, Arrington Capital, Stake Capital Group, and IOBC. Notable angels include Sreeram Kannan of EigenLayer, Rok Kopp and Mike Silagadze of Ether.fi, and Paul Taylor, formerly of BlackRock. Layer founders: (L to R) Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell and Ethan Frey Typically, smart contracts are small programs, specially packaged to be run by trustworthy “validators” on the blockchain. However, to power major software products, like web platforms, smartphone apps, and AI models, smart contracts would need to run thousands of lines of software at speeds you would find on a personal device or datacenter server. While many teams are optimizing the performance of blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts alone are not capable of meeting the high computational demand of many applications. Layer utilizes Web Assembly, which allows developers to write applications in languages like rust, that can run anywhere – even on your iPhone. Layer’s upcoming product, the “Layer SDK”, will allow developers to build new layers on top of Ethereum that run full-stack blockchain-based applications consisting of smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, UI, and verifiable off-chain services (AI agents, ZK provers, serverless functions, decentralized messaging servers, and more). This means, for the first time, a software developer can launch sovereign, incorruptible versions of their software products without any sacrifice to the user experience. The founders, Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell, and Ethan Frey are three of the most seasoned builders in the blockchain space. Their combined experience has been instrumental in the proliferation of blockchain technologies like MetaMask wallets, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and cross-chain protocols. By making the decision to band together, the founding team hopes to use all the lessons they have learned in blockchain to fulfill one of its biggest promises – to make all experiences on the internet inherently trustworthy, from the UI down to the functionality, through the shared security mechanisms of smart contracts. “All three of us have realized that, while smart contracts have given us a foundational layer of trust, they aren’t enough to support a full decentralized version of the Internet,” Sam Cassatt, Co-Founder of Layer explains. “We wanted to complete the full narrative arc of decentralized architecture, and give the world the tools necessary to build any application, with any performance requirements in this trust-minimized way.” They predict this original ideal, espoused by blockchain’s true believers, will soon be seen as an essential solution to existential threats in our digital world. According to Sam, Jake, and Ethan, the only way to verify the software and data you interact with online has not been manipulated by its creator, its host, a cybercriminal, an AI model, the government, or any other powerful actor would be with a protocol that guarantees trust. “We are thrilled to back Jake, Sam, and Ethan on their mission to build out the next generation of blockchain infrastructure.” says Wei Dai, Research Partner at 1kx, “Traditional smart contract platforms rely on replicated execution which limits scalability. Layer’s platform and SDK offer the best-in-class scalability, programmability, and configurability for shared-security applications.” Richard Muirhead, Managing Partner, Fabric Ventures commented: “We at fabric have long been excited to back teams expanding the boundaries of what is possible in crypto and Lay3r are doing exactly that. By defining a new category of shared economic security that spans hybrid off-chain and on-chain worlds, we believe Lay3r can be a Schelling point for new teams looking to build applications taking advantage of these core primitives.” - The team believes tools like Layer SDK will be the key to mitigating these incredible threats, and make the Decentralized Web the dominant web, complete with all the exciting products the founders have helped to pioneer in blockchain over the last 14 years.

October 07, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners MOUNTAIN IRON, Minn., Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heliene Inc., a leading North American solar PV module manufacturer, is pleased to announce closing a strategic equity investment up to $54 million from Transition Equity Partners (“TEP”) in collaboration with a consortium of limited partners, including affiliates of Hamilton Lane. The investment will support the expansion of Heliene’s industry-leading operations, which have served the North American solar market through multiple market cycles over the past 14 years, making Heliene one of the longest tenured solar manufacturers in North America. This strategic investment from TEP follows the $170M in capital that Heliene raised in 2023 from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC) and several of Heliene’s key customers. This capital infusion will support the development of a new 550MW production line in Rogers, MN, and the creation of 150+ new full time jobs at the facility. Heliene’s MN #3 manufacturing line will boost the company’s total U.S. based manufacturing capacity to ~1.5GW per year. Heliene has industry leading partners underpinning this expansion, including a 2.0GW supply agreement with Excelsior Energy Capital and 1.5GW supply agreement with Nexamp, touted by U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm as an investment that would “boost American manufacturing and create American jobs, while lowering families’ energy bills.” By leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act, Heliene is set to capitalize on the 45X production tax credit, whilst Heliene’s customers can unlock significant incremental value through the Domestic Content Adder (DCA). This creates strong tailwinds for Heliene, while offering its customers a decisive competitive edge in the renewable energy market. Heliene has leveraged the IRA to build a leading domestic solar supply chain, partnering with Suniva for U.S. made solar cells starting in Q3 2024, SOLARCYCLE for US made solar glass, OMCO Solar as a domestically produced racking partner, Premier Energies to pursue a cell manufacturing JV and NorSun for domestic wafer production among other initiatives to expand the United States solar supply chain and energy security. Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, stated “This investment from Transition Equity Partners is a key milestone in Heliene’s growth journey. It empowers us to expand our capacity to deliver high-quality, bankable, domestically produced solar modules that power the clean energy transition. We are proud to play a pivotal role in strengthening North America’s renewable energy supply chain and contributing to the global energy transition.” TEP believes Heliene’s proven track record and strategic positioning make them particularly compelling among US solar companies. Michael Allison, Partner at TEP, commented: “Heliene’s operational excellence and strong market position, combined with the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, make this a rare opportunity to invest in U.S. solar manufacturing at an attractive entry point. Our investment reflects our confidence in Heliene’s leadership and its growth potential as the demand for clean energy continues to surge." Stifel served as exclusive financial advisor to Heliene in connection with the entire transaction. ABOUT HELIENE Heliene, Inc. is one of North America’s fastest-growing domestic module manufacturers serving the utility-scale, commercial, and residential markets. With an in-house logistics team and remarkably responsive support staff, Heliene delivers competitively priced, high performance solar modules precisely when and where customers need them to accelerate North America’s clean energy transition.

Title: Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week

By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed down around 1% on Monday while Treasury yields rose, as traders tamped down bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate easing and worried about the Middle East conflict's impact on oil prices. While waiting for quarterly earnings season and fresh economic data, investors also braced for another big hurricane, Milton, which is expected to hit the United States this week. Relief efforts are under way after Helene, a Category-4 hurricane, killed more than 200 people across six states. Further dampening sentiment on Monday was an order from a U.S. judge for market heavyweight Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to overhaul its mobile-app business to give Android phone users more options. Analyst reports also spurred selling of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). After Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, traders pulled back from bets for a 50-basis-point rate cut in November. They were pricing in an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a roughly 14% chance the central bank would not cut rates at all, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The change in rate-cut expectations caused U.S. Treasury yields to rally, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes exceeding 4% for the first time in two months. Besides next month's Fed meeting, investors are waiting for the Consumer Price Index inflation reading for September and the kickoff of third-quarter earnings season with reports from banks, both due this week. "It's a combination of things over the last couple of days: the jobs report, the hurricane damage, the elevated energy prices and negative comments about some of the large-cap tech names," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "All of that combined just makes for a nervous day, and the Google headlines tipped things over to more aggressive selling in the last hour." James pointed to the Middle East conflict as a concern for U.S. investors who are worried about the war's economic impact, including rising oil prices. Investors continue to fret about how Israel would respond to Iran's missile strikes. On Monday, Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's city of Haifa while Israeli forces looked poised to expand ground raids into south Lebanon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398.51 points, or 0.94%, to 41,954.24, the S&P 500 lost 55.13 points, or 0.96%, to 5,695.94 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 213.94 points, or 1.18%, to 17,923.90. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.4 points at 22.64, marking its biggest one-day points gain in more than a month and its highest closing level since Aug. 8. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes, only energy advanced, finishing up 0.4%. U.S. crude futures settled up 3.7% in their fifth-straight advance on concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. [O/R] The biggest industry laggard was utilities, down 2.3%, followed by communications services, which was under pressure from Alphabet's 2.5% drop. The benchmark S&P 500's biggest drag from a single stock was from Apple, after Jefferies assumed coverage with a "hold" rating, sending the stock down 2.3%. Amazon.com finished down 3% after a Wells Fargo downgrade. Among the benchmark's biggest gainers was Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC), which added 8.52% as investors bet on solid demand for backup power generators because of the pending hurricane. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose 2% after a report that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a roughly $1-billion stake in the drugmaker. Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) closed up 9.5% on a report that activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge has built a position in the company. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 222 new highs and 55 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,292 stocks rose and 2,988 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.31-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 118 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 11.39 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.06-billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

Title: Japan’s Metaplanet expands Bitcoin portfolio with latest purchase

Metaplanet has made thirteen acquisitions since it began accumulating BTC on 23rd April. Bitcoin’s [BTC] recent price activity has drawn attention as it fluctuated from nearly $66,000 at the end of September, dipping to $60,000 on 1st October, before bouncing back. Trading at $63,480 at press time, up by 2.3% over the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency is showing strong bullish signs. Riding on this momentum, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its acquisition of an additional 108.78 BTC for $6.7 million (1 billion yen), bringing its total holdings to 639.5 BTC, valued at approximately $40 million. Source: Metaplanet Inc./X Remarking on the same an X user noted, “Nice investment choice!” Additionally, Bitcoin Treasuries data revealed that Metaplanet initiated its BTC acquisitions on 23rd April. Hence the recent purchase made on 7th October marks its thirteenth purchase, with the recent accumulation, being of 107.9 BTC, valued at 1 billion yen ($6.9 million). These recent purchases reflect Metaplanet’s consistent strategy to expand its BTC holdings amid renewed optimism in the crypto market’s outlook for the year’s final quarter. That being said, Metaplanet has gained attention for its proactive Bitcoin acquisition approach, drawing comparisons to MicroStrategy and earning the title – “Asia’s MicroStrategy” due to its institutional-level commitment to BTC. Thus, by adopting BTC, Metaplanet seeks to navigate Japan’s challenging economic landscape marked by negative interest rates and extensive quantitative easing. Needless to say, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point, shifting mainstream sentiment—especially within Wall Street—from seeing BTC as a risk to viewing it as a strategic opportunity. Subsequently, institutional interest in BTC has surged, with U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now holding 4.6% of BTC’s total supply, equating to $58 billion and approaching the holdings of Bitcoin’s largest owner, Satoshi Nakamoto. This was further confined by data from SoSoValue which showed that BTC ETFs have amassed $57.73 billion in total assets, with BlackRock leading the charge, managing $22.91 billion in its Bitcoin ETF alone. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst in a recent tweet had noted, “U.S. bitcoin ETFs had good day yesterday pushing YTD flows to new high water mark of $17.8b. They’re now 92% of the way to owning 1million bitcoin and 83% of way to passing Satoshi as top holder. Tick tock..” Hence, with the increasing adoption of BTC, it will be intriguing to observe whether Nakamoto will maintain his status as the top Bitcoin holder or if things take a u-turn.

Title: Inside the slow-motion fall of Patrick Drahi
URL: https://qz.com/patrick-drahi-sotheby-altice-john-malone-1851665674
Time Published: 2024-10-07T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz’s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here. Back at the end of the last century, Patrick Drahi was a fledgling French media entrepreneur, a one-time protege of U.S. cable king John Malone. He was intent on building an empire to rival that of his mentor, who borrowed heavily to build two media conglomerates and today controls significant stakes in Sirius XM and Charter Communications. Within little more than a decade, Drahi, a graduate of the Polytechnique, France’s MIT, had an empire stretching from Israel, across Europe into the U.S., and down to the Dominican Republic. His holdings included France’s oldest phone company and the country’s 24-hour news channel, a chunk of British Telecom, Portuguese mobile phone and cable operators, and mobile phone and TV news networks in Israel. In 2015, he moved into the U.S., buying Suddenlink, a southwestern cable company, for $9 billion. He bought New York-area cable and internet provider Cablevision for $17.7 billion from the Dolan family, and paid $200 million for Cheddar, a youth-oriented cable business channel. For fun, Drahi, who has a 750 million-euro collection of modern art, bought auction house Sotheby’s in 2019 for $3.7 billion. Drahi built his empire buying undervalued and underperforming cable and telecom companies, and applying what he and his aides claimed was telecom engineering — lowering costs with better technology and using the ensuing low prices to win customers. In truth, it wasn’t just telecom engineering, but a large dose of financial engineering that grew Drahi’s empire, most of it under the brand Altice. Drahi and his companies borrowed some $60 billion in bonds and bank loans to pay for it all. But rising interest rates, slower-than-expected growth, the pandemic, and poor management combined to push Drahi and his Altice empire to the brink. Now Drahi is engaged in a fierce battle with creditors, but is nearing the end of his rope, as interest payments rise, revenue is coming up short, and few buyers want to refinance his debt. At a meeting of creditors last fall in Goldman Sachs’ London office, Drahi said everything he owned would be for sale in an effort to cut debt and keep a smaller Altice conglomerate float. “Everything is open, it’s just a question of offer and demand,” Drahi said, according to a transcript of the meeting reported by Bloomberg. “All in man, all in. Plus the Eiffel Tower, OK?” “The house of cards is tumbling like it has never tumbled before,” investment banker Thomas Coudry told Bloomberg at the time. But more than a year later, Drahi has yet to sell enough of Altice’s holdings to right the ship. In fact, the outlook is so bad that the share price of Altice’s U.S. operations, which had almost $25 billion in debt at the end of June, has dropped 93% since the company went public in 2017. Net income for the first half of the year was down 92% from a year earlier, meaning there’s not much cash floating around to service that debt. In the U.S., Altice lost 51,000 broadband subscribers in the last quarter, despite building up its fiber-optic network and vastly reducing the number of trips its repair trucks need to make, and the number of calls to its helplines. Across his empire, which Drahi has largely divided into Altice units in several countries, $21 billion of debt comes due by the end of 2027. Yet Drahi seems in no hurry to sell major assets. Sales so far have included various media and data assets in France for about 3.5 billion euros, $1 billion for Teads, a European video ad platform once worth $5 billion, the giveaway of Cheddar to Archetype, with up to $50 million in payments if Cheddar reaches revenue targets, and the sale of a 24.5% stake in British Telecom to India’s Bharti Enterprises for 3.2 billion pounds ($4.2 billion). But that’s still a small fraction of what Altice owes. Complicating his task is a growing lack of confidence in Drahi’s leadership, exemplified by the arrest last year of his chief lieutenant, Armando Pereira, for allegedly bilking Altice’s various units out of millions of dollars in purchasing scams. Drahi conceded he’d been caught flat-footed by the scheme. “He built his empire on debt,” Coudry, the banker, told Bloomberg. “And it’s starting to crumple because of it. And he built his group with a small circle of people at the helm, which is also turning against him.” The most fashionable part of Drahi’s empire is Sotheby’s, the 280-year-old auction house that has stood alongside crosstown rival Christie’s as a symbol of wealth, taste, and power. But a major market downturn has left Sotheby’s struggling, and Drahi’s penchant for leveraging his assets may cost him control of the auction house. Leaked data published by The Financial Times in August showed Sotheby’s core income down 88%, amid a 25% drop in the value of art and other items sold in its auctions. A newly-opened Hong Kong office failed to muster enough worthy works to even hold its planned inaugural auction in the Chinese territory last month (Christie’s was able to go ahead with its Hong Kong sales). Sotheby’s has other ills: Employees and contractors are finding payments and bonuses delayed, The Wall Street Journal reported, and around New York, at least, Sotheby’s employees say morale at the firm is low. A planned move to new quarters at the former home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, designed in the middle of the last century by the brutalist master Marcel Breuer, has been delayed. New York City real estate records indicate the sale hasn’t yet closed, despite Sotheby’s having already agreed to sell part of its current headquarters. Drahi has also split Sotheby’s into three parts: the auction business, the buildings that house it, and the discrete business of lending money, both to collectors who offer their prizes for auction, and at high rates to buyers who purchase those same works. It’s all part of an effort to keep the market liquid and boost sale prices. But all of those businesses are now in a downturn. Certainly, Sotheby’s has been the victim of an economic cycle that has hit the art market. That market has been contracting for the past two years after a pandemic-fueled wave of exuberance had stuck-at-home collectors paying high prices to cover their walls in trophy art, said Katya Kazakina, who writes the Art Detective column for industry publication Artnews, and closely follows the auction market. Even though the stock market is still up, few works now in collections are coming on the art market, and that’s pushing prices and auction revenue down. “The rich people are still very rich, but psychologically, the market is seen as in a downturn and discretionary sellers are not in any rush to consign anything to auction when values have been falling,” Kazakina said in an interview. But part of the pressure on Sotheby’s is of Drahi’s own making, she added. “He’s leveraged other assets, and he’s leveraging Sotheby’s now, [but] auction revenues are down very significantly.” With the Breuer move still on hold, Drahi agreed last month to take in a new partner and recapitalize the auction house. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, known as ADQ, has just put $700 million into Sotheby’s for an undisclosed ownership stake, and Drahi himself has put in $300 million. According to the results obtained by the FT, Sotheby’s will use the $700 million to “reduce the company’s leverage” when the deal closes this fall. But with more than $1.8 billion in net long-term debt as of June, Sotheby’s will still be carrying more than $1 billion in long-term debt. The overall debt load is staggering, and observers say there’s a good chance Drahi may lose his empire. Secured creditors, including major financial investors BlackRock, Elliott Investment Management, and Pacific Investment Management Co., are pressing for payment and appear tired of the financial engineering that’s moved some assets out of their reach. They’re proposing a new deal that would give them bonds they could convert into stock, potentially taking control of the companies from Drahi. Meanwhile, Drahi is in talks with Apollo Global Management, a fiercely competitive asset manager founded by Leon Black, to borrow enough cash to start paying back his creditors and win time to turn the companies around. The problem is that, given the vast number of people switching off cable for online subscriptions, and the immense investments needed to keep cable and internet infrastructure up to date, there’s not much chance that Drahi’s various firms can actually generate enough cash to meet their heavy debt load. Or as Malone, Drahi’s one-time mentor, told CNBC last fall, as Altice’s debt load became visibly stressed, “It’s all toast.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Third-quarter earnings season to be focused on "more macro" topics - Evercore ISI

Investing.com -- US third-quarter earnings season is set to kick into gear this week, in what will be a test for a stock market trading near record highs and hovering around lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Federal Reserve’s large interest rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping the results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In a note to clients on Sunday, analysts at Evercore ISI argued that the latest quarterly earnings will be more focused on the macroeconomic picture, including the Middle East concerns, the looming presidential election in the US in November, and the possibility of additional stimulus measures from the Chinese government. These topics "will continue to exaggerate the macro, and its very uncertain uncertainties, over micro this earnings season," the analysts said. They added that they expect growth in third-quarter results to slow from a "torrid pace" clocked in the prior period, when income per share expanded by 11.3% -- its fastest rate in more than two years. The Evercore ISI analysts are forecasting earnings per share growth to come in at 6.5% during the third quarter. Wall Street consensus estimates see the figure at 2.9%, Evercore ISI noted. "Earnings strength is likely to come from [artificial intelligence]-exposed sectors Information Technology and Communication Services (both Outperform rated) as well as Defensives Health Care (Outperform) and Utilities (In Line)," the analysts said. "Cyclically geared Energy (In Line) is most at risk. Broadly though, the support from the S&P 493 is likely to moderate in [the third quarter] (albeit still supportive) before improving in [the fourth quarter of 2024] and 2025."

Shares in Asia jumped Monday, building on U.S. gains after Friday’s blockbuster jobs report fueled investor optimism. Oil prices paused their sharp rise as investors awaited Israel’s response to Iran’s missile attack. China’s markets reopen tomorrow after the Golden Week holidays. China: Hong Kong stocks surge again as mainland markets prepare to reopen Hong Kong shares jumped again, rising 1.60% the day before mainland China markets reopen. Beijing said it would explain the details of its economic stimulus plans at a Tuesday morning news conference. Japan: Yen falls and Nintendo jumps The Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8% as the yen fell, at one point touching its weakest level against the dollar in over two months. That’s good news for the country’s big export manufacturers, but a weak yen raises the cost of imports at a time of rising oil prices. Shares in Nintendo jumped 4.4% on news that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund was open to expanding its stake in the game maker. Europe: Middle East worries outweigh jobs optimism European stocks opened higher Monday morning but slid back, as worries about Mideast tensions outweighed optimism inspired by Friday’s strong jobs report in the U.S. Further tempering investors was data showing that factory orders in Germany plummeted in August. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.27% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading. U.S. premarket down as investors consider ‘no landing’ scenario All three U.S. indexes fell in premarket trading Monday, as optimism inspired by Friday’s blockbuster jobs report shifted to predictions of a “no landing” scenario—where the U.S. keeps growing and inflation returns, trimming back hopes for more interest rate reductions by the Fed. Pfizer shares rose more than 2% in pre-market trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the activist investor Starboard Value had taken an approximately $1 billion stake in the struggling drugmaker. Starboard wants Pfizer to make changes to turn its performance around as it struggles with fading sales of COVID-19 products. U.S. markets surged Friday on job numbers. Now, it’s earnings season Stocks surged Friday on news that U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September, surpassing estimates and signaling continued economic strength. The S&P 500 closed up 0.90%, and the Dow neared its record, up 0.81%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.22% with big gains for Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices. Now investor attention will turn to earnings. Pepsico kicks it off with its report Tuesday, followed by Delta Air Lines on Thursday and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock on Friday.

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%.

The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release.

Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3.

Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.

Title: Bitcoin Dominates 2024 Despite $12B Sell-Off: NYDIG Predicts Bigger Gains Ahead

According to a recent research note by Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, Bitcoin posted a modest 2.5% gain in the third quarter of 2024, bouncing back after a decline in Q2. Despite this, Cipolaro notes that the cryptocurrency’s trading has remained largely rangebound, fluctuating between $70,000 and $54,000 for most of the past six months. NYDIG’s report highlights that while Bitcoin struggled to make significant moves, it demonstrated resilience in a challenging environment. NYDIG (New York Digital Investment Group) is a prominent player in Bitcoin financial services, offering a range of solutions tailored to institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. They focus on Bitcoin custody, financing, asset management, and infrastructure, enabling clients to securely integrate Bitcoin into their businesses. Their services are highly compliant with regulatory standards, helping banks and financial institutions offer Bitcoin-related products without directly holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets​. The firm operates as a subsidiary of Stone Ridge Holdings Group. A significant factor weighing on Bitcoin’s performance in Q3 was the near resolution of several major bankruptcies, including the Mt. Gox bankruptcy, which resulted in the return of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to creditors, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro explains that these developments, combined with notable Bitcoin sales by the U.S. and German governments, contributed to downward pressure on the asset’s price. However, NYDIG’s analysis suggests that the mere fear of these coins coming to market may have had a greater impact on Bitcoin’s price than the actual selling activity. NYDIG’s research also points out that Bitcoin investors found the third quarter frustrating, as traditional asset classes outperformed the cryptocurrency. Cipolaro explains that lower interest rates provided a tailwind for assets such as utilities, real estate, and small-cap stocks, which fared better than Bitcoin during this period. NYDIG also notes that gold set new all-time highs, further challenging Bitcoin’s performance relative to other assets. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin remains the best-performing asset in 2024, according to NYDIG. Cipolaro emphasizes that Bitcoin’s lead over other asset classes has narrowed, especially as volatility spiked in August. While other assets, including precious metals and equities, gained ground, NYDIG’s analysis shows that Bitcoin continues to outperform on a year-to-date basis. Cipolaro notes that most asset classes are enjoying a strong year, echoing the trends seen in 2023. Cipolaro also highlights that Bitcoin defied typical trends in September, posting a gain in what is historically a weak month for the asset, according to NYDIG. Bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. equities also increased during Q3, ending the quarter with a rolling 90-day correlation of 0.46. However, NYDIG’s report notes that while Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks has risen, it remains low enough to offer significant diversification benefits for multi-asset portfolios. One of the dominant themes in Q3, as outlined by NYDIG, was the emergence of large Bitcoin holders who distributed or sold their holdings. Cipolaro explains that the Mt. Gox and Genesis bankruptcies, as well as government sell-offs, led to the transfer of approximately 204,000 Bitcoins during the quarter, valued at over $12.6 billion. However, NYDIG’s analysis shows that despite the magnitude of these events, there was little evidence of panic selling by creditors. NYDIG’s report also points to continued demand from U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a key factor supporting Bitcoin’s price during the quarter. According to Cipolaro, U.S. spot ETFs gathered $4.3 billion in total flows, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leading the pack. NYDIG notes that while Grayscale’s new Bitcoin Mini Trust made a competitive entry into the market, BlackRock continues to dominate ETF inflows. Cipolaro concludes by looking ahead to Q4, traditionally one of Bitcoin’s strongest periods, as noted by NYDIG. He identifies several catalysts that could boost Bitcoin’s performance, including the upcoming U.S. presidential election. According to Cipolaro, a Trump victory would likely deliver substantial gains for Bitcoin, given the former president’s endorsement of the crypto industry. However, NYDIG also suggests that Bitcoin’s strength as an asset detached from traditional financial and political systems could benefit from post-election instability, regardless of the outcome.

Title: European stocks edge higher in payrolls afterglow; eurozone retail sales due

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday, boosted by a largely positive handover from Asia after last week’s strong US jobs report, with the new corporate earnings season drawing near. At 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. climbed 0.3%. The main European indices have started the new week on a positive note, boosted by gains in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei leading the way with gains of 2%, on the back of the latest U.S. jobs report that exceeded expectations. Nonfarm payrolls data, released on Friday, showed the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, ahead of the near 150,000 forecast. This release has shifted the narrative from worries about a U.S. economic recession to the potential for a so-called "soft landing", a cyclical slowdown in economic growth that avoids the world’s largest economy going into recession. Back in Europe, the economic news is less impressive, as German factory orders slumped 5.8% on the month in August, data showed earlier Monday, a significant deterioration from the prior month’s revised higher 3.9% gain. The business climate in the German retail sector clouded over in September, according to an Ifo survey published on Monday. Retailers assessed their current situation as slightly worse than in the previous month and are more pessimistic about the coming months, the survey showed. However, Monday’s main release will be the latest eurozone retail sales data, as a guide for how the important consumer is holding up during these tricky times. Retail sales are expected to have climbed 0.2% in August, a marginal improvement from the 0.1% gain the previous month. ECB chief economist Philip Lane as well as board members Piero Cipollone and Jose Luis Escriva are all scheduled to speak later Monday, and are likely to follow President Christine Lagarde in signalling a brisk pace of further easing. In the corporate sector, the third-quarter earnings season is drawing near, with the US banking sector leading the way. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday, with their European counterparts set to follow shortly afterwards. Elsewhere, Shell (LON:SHEL) stock rose 0.4% despite the energy giant indicating in a trading update that its refining profit margins dropped sharply in the third quarter from the previous three months as global demand sagged, while oil product trading earnings also weakened. Oil prices slipped slightly Monday, handing back some of the previous week’s hefty gains as traders continue to look to the Middle East for developments. By 03:05 ET, the Brent contract slipped 0.2% to $77.86 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $74.25 per barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, with Israel having sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. On Monday, Israelis marked the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that triggered a war, which risks igniting a wider conflict in the Middle East.

Title: Take Five: Rate cuts and politics, say no more
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/take-five-rate-cuts-and-politics-say-no-more-3650279

(Reuters) -It's a packed week ahead with U.S. inflation data, the start of Q3 earnings, a French budget and possibly a big rate cut from New Zealand. Investors are also on edge as Middle East tensions escalate, while Japan's new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is in the spotlight. Here's all you need to know about the week ahead in global markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Yoruk Bahceli in Amsterdam, Karin Strohecker and Amanda Cooper in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo. 1/ ONE YEAR OF WAR One year on from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the region looks on the brink of a sprawling war that could potentially reshape the oil-rich Middle East. The conflict, which has killed more than 42,000 people, the vast majority in Gaza, is spreading. Israeli troops are now in neighbouring Lebanon, home to Iran-backed Hezbollah; Iran launched a large scale missile attack on Israel last week. Global markets have remained broadly unfazed. Oil prices, the main conduit for tremors further afield, jumped about 8% last week, but soft demand and ample supply globally have kept a lid on gains. A further escalation between Iran and Israel could change that, especially if Israel strikes Iran's oil facilities, an option that U.S. President Joe Biden said was under discussion. The scars of the conflict are visible on Israel's economy, which has suffered a number of sovereign downgrades and seen its default insurance spike and bonds slide. 2/ BUSY TIMES The U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, posing a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at elevated valuations. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) report on Friday. Other results earlier in the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have increased Q3 earnings by 5.3% from a year earlier, according to LSEG IBES. Thursday's September U.S. consumer price index, meanwhile, will be closely watched for signs that inflation is moderating. Robust jobs numbers could mean smaller rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which kicked off its easing cycle last month. Elsewhere, investors will seek to gauge the economic fallout from a dockworker strike after U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports reopened on Thursday. 3/ A RECKONING France's new government presents its long-awaited budget to parliament on Thursday. It's planning a 60-billion-euro belt-tightening drive, around 2% of GDP, next year. It reckons spending cuts and tax hikes should bring the deficit, seen rising to 6.1% this year in the latest upward revision, to 5% by end-2025. The target date for reaching the euro zone's 3% deficit limit is also being pushed back to 2029 from 2027. That's bad news just ahead of rating reviews kicking off with Fitch on Friday. Markets are not impressed. Having eased slightly, the extra premium France pays for its 10-year debt over Germany's widened back to just under 80 bps, near its highest since August. Ultimately, what may matter more is whether Prime Minister Michel Barnier can pass the budget, given a divided parliament that has investors questioning how long his government will last. Left-wing lawmakers filed a no-confidence motion against Barnier's government on Friday, but it is not expected to pass. 4/ FEELING SHEEPISH A reluctant joiner to global easing, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is catching up fast. It meets on Wednesday, and traders reckon the central bank could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The RBNZ cut rates by 25 bps to 5.25% in August, a year ahead of its own projections. Markets price in a drop below 3% by end-2025. This will still be above where traders think U.S. and euro area rates will be. Shorter-term investors are neutral towards the kiwi, but hedge funds have lapped it up this year. Positioning and potentially higher rates than others might insulate New Zealand's currency. So could the return of so-called carry trades and in this case, essentially a bearish bet on the yen in favour of bullish ones on high-yielders such as the kiwi. 5/ POLL POSITIONING When Shigeru Ishiba surprised markets by winning the contest to become Japan's prime minister, investors rushed to reposition themselves for higher interest rates. A week on and the landscape looks different, as Ishiba back-flipped not just on monetary policy, but on prior market-unfriendly support for higher corporate and capital gains taxes. It's perhaps not surprising for a hawk to hide his talons with a snap election looming on Oct. 27. Even so, Ishiba was unabashedly blunt, saying after a meeting with the Bank of Japan - whose independence Ishiba has pledged to honour - that the economy is not ready for further rate hikes. The yen, which had been surging, slid past 149 to a seven-week trough on Monday. Japanese stocks rebounded from their steepest slide since early August. Check back in a month from now for any further policy flip-flops.

A smaller percentage was secured by investors with a short-term investment horizon such as hedge funds. It is recalled that of the total shares allocated, 15% ended up in the hands of investors in Greece and the remaining 85% to foreign investors. The placement was oversubscribed by 10.4 times in total (12 times in the international offer and 1.5 times in the Greek offer). The final sale price of the HFSF shares was significantly lower than the initial estimates, at 7.55 euros from 7.95 euros that the shareholder had initially set the threshold. Both the war conflicts in the Middle East and the shareholder’s overestimation of the success of the transaction played a role in this development. According to market sources, the HFSF “fell a victim” of its success with Piraeus Bank where the placement was completed with a marginal premium.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin is ‘gold alternative,’ Ethereum a ‘technology bet’ – Why?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-is-gold-alternative-ethereum-a-technology-bet-why/
Time Published: 2024-10-07T03:00:18Z

Here’s BlackRock’s insights and selling points for BTC and ETH. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently presented unique yet different pitch decks for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. The dual pitch deck was presented during a digital assets conference held in Brazil. BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick presented BTC as a ‘risk-off’ asset, putting it at par with or better than gold. On the other hand, ETH was pitched as a ‘risk-on’ asset, similar to U.S. stocks. The asset manager praised BTC as a global monetary alternative and an excellent hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies’ relentless debasement (devaluation). Source: BlackRock On the contrary, ETH was showcased as a speculative bet on blockchain technology adoption, an investment that Mitchnick equated to US stocks. He noted, “On one hand, you have BTC, a commodity like gold and an alternative to stocks and bonds. Ethereum, more of a long-term technology bet that this blockchain will provide more use cases and more value to the economy going forward.” Part of the crypto community echoed Mitchnick’s presentations, underscoring that BTC is ‘money’ with less inflationary pressure than fiat currencies, which lose value annually. But it also settled the raging debate that has been going on for a while: ETH isn’t money. In fact, since the introduction of Blobs earlier this year, ETH’s inflation has hiked, making it less of an “ultra-sound money.” If the projections hold, BTC could rally more during future geopolitical tensions, while ETH could decline in such scenarios. BlackRock’s perspective is crucial since it is a trendsetter and widely accredited. Along with Grayscale, the asset managers are perceived to be responsible for the US shift and final approval of US spot BTC ETFs. Since the ETFs debuted, BlacRock’s ETFs have outperformed every alternative offering and crossed key milestones. At the time of writing, its BTC ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT], had a cumulative netflow of $21.5 billion with nearly $23 billion in net assets. That said, since it began trading in July, BlacRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, has netted $1.1 billion in total inflows. Ergo, the world’s largest asset manager, could influence how other investors view the sector. According to some market observers, the message seems clear — Bitcoin is money, while the rest of crypto is speculative. In the meantime, BTC was valued at $62K, down 5% on the weekly charts. On the other hand, ETH was valued at $2.4K, down 8.5% over the same period. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

"What kind of effect did this pernicious predatory culture have on all the bystanders? The boys who were lucky enough to escape being raped, but who watched their fellow pupils being publicly molested and humiliated?" Photo: Getty Of all the accounts I’ve read about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of men in cassocks – purporting to be teachers or counsellors, when in fact they were predatory paedophiles, gaining access to their preferred prey by exploiting the trust of naive, well-intended parents – it was that of Séan Duke that kept playing over and over in my mind. He wasn’t, thankfully (I might once have said thank God, but the cultural influence of the church has waned in every way in Ireland over the course of my life, much of that down to the actions of these craven men) raped himself. Instead he talked about what he bore witness to; the myriad of more minor sexual assaults that took place in plain sight in Willow Park and Blackrock College on a regular basis during his time there.

Title: Tafe and Agco: How did the tractor partners fall out of love?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Growing anxiety over Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd's (Tafe) rising ownership in Agco Corp., plus its demand for board-level changes at the US-based tractor maker, prompted the latter to snap its brand agreement with the Chennai-based company, according to Tafe's court filings, as well as a senior company executive. After discontinuing some business ties with Tafe earlier this year, Agco on 30 September terminated its agreement that allowed Tafe to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand, accusing the Indian company of what it called inappropriate and unauthorized actions. The developments come as a possible case of shareholder activism by a homegrown entity rattling a large foreign company. Two reasons“The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons. One, as you said citing legal documents, is perhaps because the executive (Agco CEO EricHansotia) was concerned about the rising ownership of Tafe in Agco," said T.R. Kesavan, group president, corporate relations and alliances, Tafe. Tafe first acquired a 12.5% stake in Agco in 2012, a year after Tafe chairman and managing director Mallika Srinivasan joined the board of the US company. Tafe has since increased its stake in Agco, touching 16.31% at the end ofSeptember2024, making it the single-largest shareholder in the world's third-largest tractor maker. Also read | TAFE presses AGCO to refresh board, consider alternativesTafe's submission to a Chennai court on 8 August said, “As between 2014-2024, the shareholding of the first plaintiff (Tafe) in the second defendant (Agco Corp) had risen to 16.3% and since the first plaintiff had become the single largest shareholder, the same had made the second defendant uncomfortable. Therefore, to force the plaintiff to a standstill agreement and to reduce its stake in the second defendant, without any justification whatsoever, the defendants issued a letter, dated 26.04.2024, unilaterally terminating the agreement between the parties concerning Turkey". Another angleKesavan provided another angle to the issue. “But the other equally important reason is that the largest shareholder, Tafe, has been urging Agco for a few years now that Agco should split the role of chairman and CEO. Tafe is the largest shareholder, a long-term strategic shareholder, a patient investor whose interests are completely aligned with those of other shareholders," said Kesavan. On the question of whether Tafe would like to increase its stake in Agco, which had a market cap of $7.3 billion as of 4 October, Kesavan said Tafe has written to all shareholders, highlighting its concerns. However, he reiterated a standstill agreement limits Tafe from owning more shares in Agco. “Please remember Tafe has not sold a single share since we invested in Agco in 2012. The commercial matters are sub-judice as it is in court, and I am afraid I cannot comment on these," he said.

The roots of dispute date to 2022, a year after Hansotia became the chair and CEO of Agco in January 2021. Citing Hansotia's lack of experience running a large business, Srinivasan suggested to the Agco board that the roles of chair and CEO should be split some time in early 2022, a Tafe executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. In April this year, Agco ended some business relationships with Tafe, citing the company’s “continued poor operational performance as a supplier, brand licensee and distributor to Agco" and “continued lack of focus on Agco customers in several key markets". Finally, on 30 September, Agco said it was ending, with immediate effect, its agreement with Tafe that allowed the homegrown company to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand. This prompted a Tafe executive to write to Agco's shareholders, underlining what it said were strategic missteps, poor execution, and underperformance by the US company. Tafe also secured a reprieve from a court in Chennai, which put on hold the dissolution of the agreement between the two companies. Call for changes“Tafe calls for shareholder-driven boardroom changes, citing issues such as missed market opportunities, unsuccessful acquisitions, and ballooning costs," P. Krishnamurthy, corporate advisor to Tafe, said in a letter dated 30 September. “Rather than engage constructively with Tafe, the board has taken measures to disenfranchise Tafe and isolate Tafe’s representative from meaningful boardroom involvement," the letter said. Founded in 1990, Agco does not have a promoter and counts money managers Vanguard and Blackrock as its second and third largest shareholders, owning 10.5% and 7.1% respectively, as of 30 June. Its revenue improved 13.9% from the year-ago period to $14.41 billion in the year ended December 2023, while profit jumped 34.4% to $1.7 billion.

In April this year, 15 of the 20 largest public shareholders, who own 56% of Agco, voted to reappoint Hansotia as director. Sole dissenterThe sole dissenter was Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which owns 0.91% of Agco, according to filings reviewed by Mint. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual," reasoned Norges, as it rejected the reappointment of Hansotia. “Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest."

Privately held Tafe is the country’s second-largest tractor maker, behind leader Mahindra and Mahindra. In the year ended March 2023, it had ₹12,619 crore in revenue and ₹1,278 crore in profit. Agco owns 20.7% of Tafe, while Simpson & Co Ltd, the holding company of the Amalgamations group, holds the remaining 79.3% of shares. An Agco executive, Robert Crain, is also on the Tafe board. “The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons.

Gold prices slipped after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report poured cold water on expectations for an aggressive rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, boosting the dollar. U.S. job growth accelerated in September and the unemployment rate slipped to 4.1%, further easing pressure on the Fed to deliver another 50 basis point rate cut at its Nov. 6-7 policy meeting. US non-farm payrolls showed job additions of 254K against the expectations of 150K and 72K of upward revisions to the past two months of data.

Escalating tensions increased demand for safe-haven assets, driving gold to record highs and silver to a 12-year peak. However, gains were limited by the strengthening dollar and rising U.S. bond yields. Strong non-farm payroll data in the U.S. pushed both the dollar index and 10-year bond yields to two-month highs. Additionally, rising crude oil prices tempered expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, causing gold and silver prices to retreat from their peaks. Gold has support at $2,631-$2,610, with resistance at $2,662-$2,678. Silver has support at $31.82-$31.68 and resistance at $32.35-$32.52.

Silver has support at ₹92,850-₹92,050, while resistance is at ₹94,130-₹94,980. de CRUDE OIL Crude oil prices experienced significant volatility last week, recovering from their lows to reach five-week highs, driven by heightened tensions in the Middle East and better-than-expected U.S. non-farm payroll data. Israel’s military actions against Lebanon and its threats of retaliation against Iran in response to missile attacks on Israel have further unsettled global oil markets. The crude oil prices rose due to positive U.S. economic data, including the non-farm payroll report and the unemployment rate. The reopening of Chinese markets this week, combined with recent stimulus measures, is expected to boost China’s oil demand, providing further support to prices. However, gains are being capped by the upcoming OPEC+ production hike starting in December and the strengthening U.S. dollar. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile during today’s session. Crude oil has support at $73.10–$72.50 and resistance at $74.20–$75.00. In INR, crude oil has support at ₹6,250–₹6,180 and resistance at ₹6,420–₹6,480.

Geo-political factors, new SEBI rules on F&O, and October seasonality also played a role. We believe the worst of the geo-political impact and China-related issues is now behind us. We began purchasing equities in a significant way yesterday and will continue to do so in the coming days. In the short term, we are positive about the markets. However, longer term, we remain cautious due to deteriorating global macroeconomic conditions and high valuations. Therefore, we plan to book profits on our current purchases by the end of CY 2024. “Nifty bounced back sharply in the first half on Friday, re-tested the trendline, and made a new low on the hourly chart.

U.S. stocks ended higher Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report, with all three major benchmarks picking up steam in late afternoon trading to end with weekly gains.

Three central banks are set to release their interest rate decisions this week, namely the Bank of Korea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of India. Nifty ended lower for the fifth consecutive session on October 4. It recorded its worst week in over two years amid rising tensions in the middle east. At close, Nifty was down 0.79% or 200.3 points at 25049.9. Nifty fell for the fifth consecutive session on Oct 04 forming a bear candle with a long upper shadow. This means that the upward retracement is happening in a running manner. Over the week, Nifty fell 4.45% retracing the gains of several weeks. This is a negative sign though oversold conditions may mean a small pullback in the near term. Nifty could now take support at 24753 and later 24420 while 25453 could act as a resistance in the near term. In the past week, panic-selling hit Dalal Street, pushing Nifty near the psychological 25,000 mark. However, a potential rebound is on the cards as Nifty bulls may regroup following a strong close on Wall Street after the US September Jobs Report eased recession fears. Key upcoming events include the FOMC Meeting Minutes and RBI MPC outcome on 9th October, and the US CPI data on 10th October.

The focus will be on the RBI monetary policy outcome and quarterly results of India Inc that will start trickling in from this week. Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India, said: The forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from October 7-9 will be conducted with the induction of three new MPC members in place of the retiring members. During the last meeting of MPC held in August, internal RBI members were biased towards an extended policy rate hold. “The September jobs report is hard proof that a soft landing is within the grasp of the Federal Reserve. Obviously, there is healthy momentum in the US labour market — US companies added 254,000 jobs when the projected increase was 150,000. Not just that, US unemployment has also ticked down to 4.1%, when economists expected that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged, or in fact, rise. The report also confirms that we will, most likely, conclude 2024 with two 25 bps cuts in November and December, without any big bang 50 bps rate cut. The jobs report would have strengthened the narrative for market bulls, had it not been for the widening Middle East conflicts. Now, with crude oil prices jumping by $3 a barrel, all eyes would be keenly glued to the fallouts of this geopolitical disturbance.” The market’s recovery faltered, with the Nifty closing at a 3-week low, managing to stay above 25,000. Selling pressure was widespread, and the overall market breadth favored declines. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are shifting funds away from India, viewing it as a relatively expensive market. Instead, they are turning to China, anticipating an economic revival there. This optimism was fueled by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cutting interest rates and lowering the reserve requirement ratio, alongside fiscal stimulus measures. These moves triggered a strong rally in both Chinese and Hong Kong markets, pushing up commodity prices. On the domestic front, the market’s focus will also be on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from October 7 to 9, 2024, with the outcome to be announced on Wednesday, October 9. The RBI is expected to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged in its upcoming policy review, having maintained it at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive meeting in August 2024. This aligns with market expectations, as the central bank aims to bring inflation closer to its medium-term target of 4% while supporting economic growth. The Q2 earnings season is kicking off with key companies like TCS, Tata Elxsi, DMart, and IREDA among others, which will drive stock-specific movements. Domestically, liquidity remains strong, with signs of sectoral rotation from overvalued segments to areas with more attractive valuations. Additionally, commodity prices, the U.S. dollar index, and key U.S. macroeconomic data will play a crucial role in determining market direction. Geopolitical developments will also continue to be a significant factor on the global front. Technically, the Nifty has the immediate and critical support level stands at 24,750, with the next support around the rising 100-day moving average (DMA) near the 24,400 mark. On the upside, 25,500 and 25,700 will act as key resistance levels during any potential pullback. While Banknifty, The 100-day moving average (DMA) at 51,100 serves as an immediate support level, with the 50,000-49,500 range, which aligns with the 200-DMA, acting as the next support zone. On the upside, 52,500 and 53,300 will be key resistance levels during any pullback. Bank of Maharashtra raised Rs 3,500 crore from QIP - allotted at Rs 57.36 against the floor price of Rs 60.37. LIC was allotted nearly 26 crore shares (42.56% of the total QIP) ICICI Prudential Life Insurance allotted over five crore shares - 8.51% of the total QIP Aditya Birla Sun Life was allotted nearly 3.5 crore shares representing 5.67% of the total QIP. Bank of Maharashtra - a PSB is headquartered in Pune. It has about three crore customers with 2,489 branches as of March 2024. Asia Index Private Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of BSE, has announces the launch of three indices namely BSE SENSEX Sixty 65: 35, BSE SENSEX Sixty, BSE Power and Energy Index. “The September jobs report is hard proof that a soft landing is within the grasp of the Federal Reserve. Obviously, there is healthy momentum in the US labour market — US companies added 254,000 jobs when the projected increase was 150,000. Not just that, US unemployment has also ticked down to 4.1%, when economists expected that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged, or in fact, rise. The report also confirms that we will, most likely, conclude 2024 with two 25 bps cuts in November and December, without any big bang 50 bps rate cut. The jobs report would have strengthened the narrative for market bulls, had it not been for the widening Middle East conflicts. Now, with crude oil prices jumping by $3 a barrel, all eyes would be keenly glued to the fallouts of this geopolitical disturbance.” Fitch Ratings has assigned Adani Green Energy Limited Hybrid RG1’s (AGEL Hybrid RG1) proposed 20-year partially amortising senior secured notes due 2044 a first-time expected rating of ‘BBB-(EXP)‘.

The recent US jobs data raised hopes for soft landing of the world’s largest economy and seems to have reduced the chances of another 50 bps rate cut by the end of this year. The US inflation continued to fall for fifth consecutive month, dropping to 2.5 percent in August, from 2.9 percent in July. Additionally, PPI and wholesale inventories data from the US, retail sales from Europe, household spending & PPI numbers from Japan, and vehicle sales from China will also be watched. 1) 8th results of Haryana and J& K 2) 9th RBI policy 3) 10th Result season start The Indian benchmark indices were knocked down badly last week. Nifty 50, Sensex and the Nifty Bank index tumbled over 4 per cent. Escalating tensions in the Middle East have been weighing on the Indian equities. Last week, we were bullish and had expected the benchmark indices to go up. That view has gone wrong. The sharp fall last week has turned the short-term picture weak. However, there is not threat for the broader uptrend. Although there is room to fall more from here, supports are coming up which can halt the fall and produce a bounce. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may prefer to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at their forthcoming meeting as the escalating Iran-Israel conflict could pose inflationary risks due to higher crude oil prices even as growth remains steady. After a wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent weeks, the primary market will experience a brief slowdown, with only two new public issues scheduled for the next week, aiming to raise ₹365 crore. Read more Nine of the top-10 most valued firms together lost a whopping ₹4,74,906.18 crore in market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries and HDFC Bank taking the steepest hit, in line with weak trends in equities. A war of words broke out between Ola founder Bhavish Agarwal and stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday on social media platform X over the after-sales and service quality of the company’s electric scooters. It started when Kamra responded to a post on X by Agarwal, who posted a photo of Ola’s gigafactory, by putting a picture of several Ola Electric scooters parked together seemingly waiting for servicing. Read more Mid-cap companies are projected to outperform their large-cap counterparts in FY25 as they quickly adopt emerging technologies and capture market share in niche sectors. Analyst estimates suggest that tier-1 companies, or large-caps, are expected to witness revenue growth of 0.9-3 per cent q-o-q, while mid-caps are expected to grow by 2.1-4.5 per cent. Equipped with ₹17,600 crore fundraising and a zero-debt status, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group companies — Reliance Infrastructure Ltd and Reliance Power Ltd — are poised to execute their growth strategies, according to officials. In the past two weeks, both companies have announced raising ₹4,500 crore through preferential issues of equity shares and ₹7,100 crore from global investment fund Varde Partners through equity-linked long-term FCCBs, having a long maturity period of 10 years and low interest rate of 5 per cent. Read more The short-term outlook is bearish for IDBI Bank. The stock has been in a strong downtrend since the last week of July this year. The 4.5 per cent fall in the second half of last week has dragged the share price well below the 200-day moving average (DMA). This can continue to keep the stock under pressure.

Title: Five talking points from the weekend GAA club championships
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2024/10/06/five-talking-points-from-the-weekend-gaa-club-championships/
Time Published: 2024-10-06T20:37:05Z
Full Content:
Kilmacud Crokes’ win over Na Fianna kept them on course for a club record fourth successive Dublin football title. They had to pedal hard in the second half, but the champions held on for a 1-12 to 0-12 victory – the decisive goal coming in first-half injury time from Mark O’Leary. Their final against Cuala is something of a neighbourhood squabble but the first time it has been played out at this level. Cuala’s defeat of Ballymun Kickhams on Saturday sent them to a first senior football final since 1988. Back-to-back All-Ireland hurling champions in 2017-18, the Dalkey club have yet to win the Dublin football title. This weekend’s semi-final success was spearheaded by recently confirmed football All Star nominee Con O’Callaghan, who started both All-Ireland club hurling finals and scored 0-8 in the 0-16 to 1-8 win over Ballymun. Southside football in the capital has strengthened considerably in the 36 years since Cuala’s last final. Of the 35 titles contested 18 have been won by clubs from south of the river and none of Thomas Davis, Kilmacud Crokes and Ballyboden St Enda’s had even won their first senior championship. Kilmacud could go clear second on the Dublin roll of honour if they win the final – despite having won the first of their 11 titles in 1992, 46 years after O’Toole’s won their 11th. Although the champions will be hot favourites a few in the club may remember how in 2009 when they reached the Dublin under-21 final against an unfancied Cuala it didn’t go to plan and the underdogs ran out 2-7 to 0-6 winners. The weekend’s two county football finals ended in draws and will go to replays. In Leitrim, Ballinamore Seán O’Heslin’s, winners three years ago, had nearly got home but champions Mohill rallied and replacement Matthew Murphy got a late equaliser. Carlow also featured recent champions – from 2022 and 2021 – in the meeting of Palatine and Rathvilly, and it took two late points from Liam Molloy and Liam Gavin to force a replay. Elsewhere “winner on the day” protocols led to great excitement and heartbreak in Clare where Sixmilebridge beat Inagh-Kilnamona to join Saturday’s victorious semi-finalists Feakle in the hurling final after extra time and penalties. The shoot-out went to a second round before David Fitzgerald’s penalty flew over the bar to send the Bridge through – a cruel sign-off to a brilliant season for Fitzgerald who nonetheless has an All-Ireland and League double under his belt. In the Cork football championship, which has provided a few shoot-outs in recent times, Nemo Rangers qualified for the semi-finals with a 5-4 penalty win over Clonakilty when extra time had failed to separate the teams. The vital kick fell to Ross Corkery, a son of former All Star Colin, and he did the needful. The Cork hurling semi-finals were contrasting events. Divisional side Imokilly had a comfortable nine-point win over Blackrock to reach a 10th final. The east Cork side have established quite a record since breaking through 27 years ago. Since then they have won five titles – two back-to-back and also a three-in-a-row – and lost just the one, in 2001, although they did lose three other finals before they won their first. That 1997 final is to be re-enacted this year as champions Sarsfields, their opponents back then, won their semi-final against Midleton, albeit without any measure of comfort. It looked as if Conor Lehane’s injury-time equaliser had forced extra time but up popped last year’s top gun Aaron Myers to decide the match 0-22 to 0-21. It has been part of the mythology of Kilkenny’s 20th century hurling domination that manager Brian Cody, who led the county to 11 All-Irelands, hadn’t been an obvious choice given his experiences in charge of home club James Stephens. In his autobiography Cody acknowledged as much. “In stark, blunt terms you could say that my years as The Village manager had been a failure – certainly when it came to winning trophies – so there was no obvious reason why county chairman John Healy or the rest of the board would look in my direction.” Since retiring after his record-breaking exploits with the county he has been back involved with the club but with no discernible lift in fortunes, having precipitously toppled in three years from losing a county final to being blitzed in last year’s semi-final and on Saturday being beaten in a relegation playoff by Glenmore after a difficult season. It will be a first campaign outside senior in 70 years. They weren’t the only former All-Ireland champions to find themselves on the downward escalator at the weekend. Galway’s Kiltormer, winners of the Tommy Moore in 1992, slipped into junior hurling for next year after losing a relegation playoff with Kilbeacanty. Both of the Mayo football semi-finals went to extra time before Ballina Stephenites saw off Ballaghaderreen and Knockmore came from behind to pip Breaffy. It will be the fifth year running that the local rivals will be in the county final but the first time that they have played each other in 20 years, Ballina coming out on top on that occasion. On Sunday Ballina emerged on top by 1-18 to 2-12, and had to survive a late goal chance for Shairoze Akram which was somehow scrambled to safety and they will contest a third successive final. Later there were times when Breaffy looked more likely winners but Knockmore refused to wilt. In extra time it appeared as if Pearse Ruttledge’s sending off had swung the match in Breaffy’s direction but they too lost a man when Conor Beirne also picked up a red card. Late goals in extra time from replacements Charlie Bourke and Billy Ruane settled the matter for a 2-15 to 0-18 victory.

Title: Ukrainian families in South Dublin face relocation on Monday
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2024/10/06/ukrainian-families-in-south-dublin-face-relocation-on-monday/

Olha Sheremet’s husband Viktor has stomach cancer, meaning she must cook special food for him, she explains through a translation app while standing at the foot of a staircase in a building in Blackrock, Co Dublin. With tears streaming down her face, she moves her hand over her heart as she shows photographs of her son holding a gun while wearing a military uniform on the front line in Ukraine. She speaks to him once a month, she says. “We cannot live and cook in a hotel. Everything is nearby here, both the hospital and medical centre where my husband is being monitored. We are elderly people and it is very difficult for us to move,” the translation reads. She is one of 29 Ukrainians in a property in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock who have been told that three buses will arrive on Monday morning to move them to new accommodation. Under plans drawn up by the Department of Integration, the group which has been living at the property since December 2022, is to be split up and moved to three separate hotels near Citywest, Liffey Valley and Temple Bar. [ Ukraine’s weariness with the West grows as war enters new phase: ‘People are tired, but we have no choice’Opens in new window ] The group varies in age with eight children attending schools in the area, five of whom are in primary schools, one in secondary and two at preschool. Living there for almost two years, they have become a “big family”, they say. Half of them are working nearby, in areas such as construction, caring, pharmacy and cleaning while others are in further education or learning English to use their qualifications in Dublin. “Everyone hopes and prays that something will be organised this week so we can stay long-term. It’s very important because we worked so hard to build our lives in this area,” says Diana Tkachuk, a 31-year-old from Sverdlovsk, who lives there with her six-year-old daughter Alisa. Sitting beside her, Natalia Mishchenko shows videos she took in March 2022, of the regional intensive care hospital of Mariupol, where she worked as a nurse, reduced to rubble. The 44-year-old is working in a local petrol station while studying to work as a nurse in the Republic. Her young daughter, Varvara, attends the same school as Alisa and plays camogie locally, she says. “All our lives are organised in this area,” says Ms Tkachuk, who works locally as a florist. “It’s very sad because we have to move out and live separately. I think for some people, it will be harder without support like English, it will be hard,” she says. She does not worry for herself, she adds, but for her daughter who will have to start over again, something that was challenging when they first arrived. “Everyone is upset, stressed and shocked,” she says. Ramziia Zidliaieva, a 66-year-old economist from Crimea, who lives at the property with her son Aider said she will not be boarding the bus on Monday morning, even if it means they will officially have nowhere to stay. “I want to stay here because I like this house and I like the very nice people. It’s very good, they’re beautiful people and they’re fighting for us. I’m very happy I have these people and this family and I thank god,” she says. The employer of Ms Zidliaieva’s son in Dún Laoghaire wrote to the department urging to reconsider the move which they described as “shocking”. Blackrock Community Alliance, a group of locals advocating for the Ukrainians, also urged the department not to proceed with the move. One letter from Carysfort National School said it has worked “tirelessly” to establish a sense of security for the families. It says children living at the property had “fully settled” within the local community, adding that the “proposed disruption would impact severely on these children’s emotional state”. The residents were initially informed on September 2nd, as the children were returning to school. The department explained it is consolidating its accommodation portfolio due to a reduction in the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and seeking accommodation. [ ‘He called Ukraine his home’: frontline fighters recall Irish soldier Robert Deegan killed by Russian shellingOpens in new window ] A subsequent letter informed them of the buses due to arrive on Monday morning, adding that if they refuse the accommodation, they would not receive further offers, nor could they access the Citywest Transit Hub. “These actions are necessary to ensure the provision of accommodation for all who need it,” the letter reads. The residents wrote to the department asking it to reconsider or at least postpone the move until alternative arrangements could be made, either through private rented accommodation or host families, though no such pledges have yet been made. The majority are refusing to board the buses, hoping an agreement can be reached in the coming days. The owner of the property, who wished for their name and the precise location of the accommodation to remain anonymous, said the department declined a request for an extension to allow a planned transition to private accommodation in the area or at the current property. Applications for rent supplements in the hope of staying on as private tenants have also been declined by the Department of Social Protection as it deemed the property unsuitable for their needs. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said contracts are being ended regularly and that every effort is being made to keep those being moved, as local as possible. “The department appreciates that this is not easy for people and that moving location can be very disruptive, but at all times the department was clear that State-funded accommodation is temporary and subject to change,” he said.

Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin, are to be “uprooted” and moved to hotels on Monday, supporters have claimed. Blackrock Supporters Group issued a media alert tonight stating the refugees will be moved to West Dublin hotels. The Irish Independent has asked the Department of Children if this report is accurate and for details. A spokesperson for the group said: “Supporters of the Blackrock Ukrainians were shocked that the Blackrock centre had been prioritised for closure. “They are vulnerable families and are in schools and jobs locally. To be moved now after two years to a remote, out of town hotel setting makes no sense. "The Ombudsman for Children has been clear that long term accommodation in hotels is damaging and inappropriate for children. “Hotels are also much more expensive than this self-catering model. Nothing about this closure makes sense.” The group has claimed the Department of Children and Integration will terminate its contract for Ukrainian refugee accommodation in Blackrock. They added that a “decision to close the state accommodation and relocate the vulnerable tenants has been unsuccessfully appealed by the impacted Ukrainian refugees, as well as the local community and representatives”. The group of 30 Ukrainians had been resident at the Blackrock property since December 2022, the group stated. They claimed the residents are “set to be moved to three different hotels and are advised that the new accommodation is temporary, and they can expect to be moved again”. The group added that it had been “highlighted in a written appeal that their lives will be put into complete turmoil if they are forced to relocate now after two years of settled life in Blackrock”. The Blackrock property has been “converted from commercial office use to emergency use, with up to 42 bedspaces and communal self-catering facilities,” the group stated, “The Ukrainians appealed as a group to the Department of Children and Integration to review the decision as their children are settled in schools and into the community,” it added. “The group learned of the closure on September 2 as schools reopened and have been supported by parents in local schools, as well as neighbours, to appeal to the Department to review the decision or delay the closure to allow them to find appropriate accommodation in the area,” the group said. Supporters and Ukrainians have joined together to now create the Blackrock Community Alliance to “help and representations have been made to the Minister for Children, Roderic O’Gorman and to local TDs and councillors,” the notification explained. A petition had been signed by 1,200 in the area and employers and schools had written letters of support. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news
