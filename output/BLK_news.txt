We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 14 AI News Investors Are Paying Attention To. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors are paying attention to. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, now the most valuable private firm in the world, back in November 2022 had widespread implications for the technology industry. In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued. The computer scientist claims that the 2010s were the age of scaling, and now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing, and scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Market Capitalization: $2.2 Trillion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 9, tech website Android Authority reported that the AI-capable Tensor processors developed by Google for the Pixel line of smartphones had failed to meet financial targets. The report highlights that the financial goal for the tech titan is about $65 per chip to make the business viable. For additional context, the tech website claims that Qualcomm’s latest flagship chips cost around $150. Google released the latest Pixel phones earlier this year. The phones feature the on-device artificial intelligent assistant Gemini Nano and an array of generative AI features. Overall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks investors are paying attention to. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The stock traded flat on Thursday’s early trade. Swiggy shares ended the listing day trading session at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium. Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 110145.png (NSE data) Swiggy Stock Listing by Bajaj Broking Research “Swiggy’s listing on the Indian stock market has stirred up notable excitement, but early trading volatility reveals investor caution. While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood.

Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The stock traded flat on Thursday’s early trade. Swiggy shares ended the listing day trading session at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium. Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.

While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price.

While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Unveils ‘Better Binary Quantization’ to Enhance Elasticsearch for AI and Machine Learning Data Processing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored. Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology. “Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”. READ ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported. In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation. Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Market Capitalization: $9.24 billion Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is a search artificial intelligence (AI) company that delivers hosted and managed solutions designed to run in hybrid, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. The company leverages AI across its product offerings, particularly within its “Elastic Stack” comprising Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack) and more. On November 11, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) introduced a new feature called Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) for Elasticsearch, the company’s open-source search and analytics engine. The BBQ tool will make it easier to store and work with complex data types known as vectors, which are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The development of BBQ is a significant step toward data processing and storage, enhancing the capabilities of Elasticsearch. It is available as a tech preview for both self-managed and cloud users of Elasticsearch and will be contributed to Apache Lucene, an open-source Java library used as a search engine. Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene. “Elasticsearch is evolving to become one of the best vector databases in the world, and we see our users wanting to put more and more vectorized data in it. Better Binary Quantization is our latest innovation to reduce the resources needed to store vectorized data and provide freedom to our users to vectorize all the things.” Overall ESTC ranks 13th on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On a chilly and crisp autumnal day, mourners at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, south Dublin, heard about “a truly remarkable woman” who had a “speaking voice of silk”. Tribute was paid to the talented broadcaster, writer and musician, who died at the age of 90 last Friday. It came five years after her famous husband’s passing on November 4, 2019. Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo: Steve Humphreys As was fitting for someone renowned for her love of the arts, her funeral mass included classical music pieces chosen by Kathleen herself, along with extracts from her favourite poems. Among those in attendance were RTÉ figures such as Marty Whelan, Mary Kennedy, Dave Fanning, Joe Duffy, Ray D’Arcy, Mike Murphy and Olivia O’Leary. Kevin Bakhurst, the RTÉ director-general, was also in attendance, alongside Riverdance co-founder Moya Doherty, film producer John McColgan and presenter Pat Kenny. Suzy Byrne (second from left) with family members including her sister Crona Byrne (right) after their mother’s funeral. Photos: Steve Humphreys During the funeral mass, officiated by Fr Leonard Moloney, daughter Suzy told the congregation how her mum was “a lady”. “She was full of grace, gentility and love. Her life was dominated by four words – family, friendship, faith and fun,” she said. A mother to Suzy and Crona and grandmother to five, she had died peacefully at Blackrock Clinic at her favourite time of the day, which was dawn. Kathleen had many monikers over the years but her fondest one was that of ‘Nana Kit’. Suzy said that when she told her parents she was pregnant, Gay said her mother was “speechless for the first time in her life”. “Then she spoke. ‘From today, I will answer to all as Nana Kit.’ I laughed, saying, ‘Mum, I have seven months to go’. Her only response: ‘I am Nana Kit now.’” As soon as her first grandson Cian arrived, she was “besotted”. He was joined by grandchildren Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry. She had a “magical place in her heart” for children, Suzy said. Joe Duffy (left) outside the church with fellow mourners. Photo: Steve Humphreys Being a grandmother inspired her to create a series of popular children’s books, Pigín of Howth. “It was through piglet that Nana Kit educated our children on so many levels, by making it fun and telling them stories. It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were “We watched in awe as the children hung on her every word. Through Pigín and co, Nana Kit was a grandmother to a nation of children. Our children shared her as Nana Kit, just as myself and Crona shared both Mum and Dad as we grew up.” Most treasured of all were those lazy Sundays with Suzy’s family at their old home in Howth, having moved to Sandymount in recent years. “It started off as a late lunch but quickly became all day,” she said. “It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were. Their visits defined our week as a family. We slipped easily into the tradition of the full Sunday roast, the ritual of sitting around for hours, just chatting.” John McColgan and Moya Doherty at the funeral of Kathleen Watkins. Photo: Collins Kathleen placed an emphasis on her friendships. After the loss of her “soulmate” Gay, she turned to her circle of pals who “welcomed her with open arms”. Having asked one of them for a memory of her mother, she recalled it was “one of beauty – beauty of face, beauty of demeanour, of action and reaction”. “Today, we remember with love and gratitude our mother, our Nana Kit and your friend,” she said. “Mum had great faith. She knew without question that she would be reunited with Dad when she left us. Spiritually, she believed first and foremost in love. If you have love, you will have joy. With those, you have enough. “Today, I say goodbye to my mother and my closest friend. I never knew a day without her in it. How lucky I am to be able to say that. God granted her a peaceful death at the end of an incredible life. She gave us all such joy and love. We will have that forever.” Fr Leonard said she was a “woman of empathy and compassion” and spoke of her long marriage of 55 years. They were loved, both of them “Ireland doesn’t do monarchs. But if we did, I do think Gay and Kathleen would have been contenders for the crown. They were loved, both of them,” he said. As well as being RTÉ’s first continuity announcer, she was also a talented harpist and folk singer and inspired granddaughter Sadhbh to take up the harp. Former presenter Pat Kenny. Photo: Steve Humphreys You could hear a pin drop as Sadhbh played a tribute to her grandmother with a rendition of Eleanor Plunkett. As was her wish, as indicated in her last-ever interview with the Sunday Independent, Frank McNamara performed Pie Jesu during Communion before Gabriel’s Oboe. Grandson Cian brought the mass to a close with a final reflection on his esteemed grandmother. She had advised him to “always give people your time”. “It is the most precious gift of all and you should always give people the benefit of the doubt as you never know what anyone is going through,” he said. Her remains were taken for a private burial before mourners were invited to toast her eventful life at her and Gay’s favourite spot, the Intercontinental hotel.

Title: Chinese EV firm swoops on German flying taxi start-up

An aircraft from the Baden-based air cab manufacturer Volocopter with the ADAC logo is parked on the airfield in August. Photo: Getty Chinese conglomerate Geely is in advanced talks to take control of Germany’s Volocopter in a deal that would save the flying taxi start-up from potential bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the talks. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has discussed taking a majority stake in Volocopter by leading a consortium that will inject fresh capital into the company, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. The funding round would be about $95m (€89.6m) in exchange for roughly 85pc ownership, said one of the people. The family office of German industrialist Gerhard Sturm would also participate in the deal, the person said. If completed, the deal would slash the start-up’s valuation from a peak of $1.9bn in 2022 to about $110m. The Geely group is working through due diligence and aims to finish next month. Volocopter has also held discussions with other potential bidders. No final decisions on the terms have been made and the deal could still fall apart. Volocopter’s financial troubles show the fraught effort to make flying cars a reality in the US and Europe, where start-ups often collapse before they’re able to sell a single ride. In China, however, the government has made boosting the “low-altitude” economy a priority, along with an electric vehicle industry that is bombarding Germany’s automakers with competition. A Geely spokesperson declined to comment. Sturm’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. “Due to ongoing financing and contractual obligations, we will not disclose investor names, amounts raised, or any predictions for the future,” a representative for Volocopter said. With the Geely deal, Volocopter is weighing moving the manufacturing of its future aircraft to China, the people said. Its current, smaller model is being built in Germany. The Volocopter representative said it considers the German facility a “reference facility” for working out efficient production practices. That will give the company a blueprint for scaling up as it expands overseas, she added. Formed in 2011, Volocopter was among a raft of start-ups developing electric vertical take-off and landing, or what the industry called EVTOL. It raised $600m from German firms and global investors, including Mercedes-Benz Group, DB Schenker, Blackrock and Neom, Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city project. The start-up burned through cash and swapped out its chief executive in 2022. Volocopter planned to debut its first commercial aircraft, a two-seater called the VoloCity, at the Olympics this summer in Paris. But it missed the deadline.

The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” The Rs. 11,300-crore IPO comprised a fresh capital of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹ 6,828 crore. The food delivery major raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors through the anchor book. Among the investors who were allocated shares are New World Fund Inc, Government Pension Fund Global, Nomura Funds Ireland Public Limited Company, Fidelity Funds, BlackRock, Allianz Global Investors Fund and Schroder International, according to a circular uploaded on BSE’s website. ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd were also allotted shares in the anchor round. Swiggy’s upper price band valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently has a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy plans to use the IPO proceeds to fund investments in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, technology and cloud infrastructure investments, brand marketing and business promotion expenses to enhance the brand awareness and visibility of its platform across segments, and inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes. “Post Listing: For allotted investors, one should not expect any kind of listing gains. Hence, only risky investors should consider the company to HOLD FOR LONG TREM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit the space with better discounted opportunity,” said Tapse. Swiggy is an online food delivery platform that emerged in India in 2014. It offers a convenient solution for ordering food from various restaurants. The company operates five business units: Food Delivery, out-of-home consumption, including restaurant visits and events; Quick Commerce, offering on-demand delivery of groceries and household items; supply chain and distribution, providing B2B deliveries, warehousing, logistics, and distribution for wholesalers and retailers; and platform innovation, introducing new services like Swiggy Genie and Swiggy Minis. Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Citigroup Global Markets India, Jefferies India, Avendus Capital, J.P. Morgan India, BoFA Securities India, and ICICI Securities were the book-running lead managers of the IPO. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Is Block, Inc. (SQ) the Best Cryptocurrency Stock to Buy According to Wall Street?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks. Post Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections, the price of bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. On November 12, Bitcoin neared a record $90,000. While Trump has revealed his plans to make America the crypto capital of the world, he has stated that he would be sacking the current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has led the SEC's crackdown on the crypto market. Gensler tried to regulate the market which he believed, was at least partially made up of securities trading illegally. Market analyst at StoneX Financial, Matt Simpson, emphasized that bitcoin prices could go as high as $100,000 in case the Trump administration deregulates crypto. Although Trump was once railing against cryptocurrencies, he later embraced crypto as he started a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial in September. While commenting on the crypto industry, he said “It’s very young and very growing” and that he believes in it. He has also expressed support for domestic Bitcoin miners saying that if crypto is going to define the future, he wants it to be mined, minted, and made in the US. Bitcoin has surged more than 26% since election day on November 5. As reported by CNBC, Mike Colonnese, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright, stated: “Bitcoin is now in price discovery mode after breaking through all-time highs early last Wednesday morning when it was officially declared that Trump won the election. Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024 and [we] see bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year.” As the crypto market anticipates a positive and bright regulatory climate under the Trump administration, crypto-focused stocks also surged post-election. Vice President and General Manager of Robinhood, Johann Kerbrat, appeared on CNBC and referred to the post-election scenario as a big moment for the firm on the crypto side considering bitcoin was not even a fraction of its current price two years ago. The firm saw a lot of activity on the crypto volume. While the company has faced scrutiny from the SEC under the Biden administration, Kerbrat is hopeful to see more crypto-friendly policymaking. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan seconded this stance when he appeared on CNBC Crypto World on November 12. In his opinion, Trump’s economic policies should be positive for crypto. He referred to the prevailing market as a golden age of crypto and that it’s right to be bullish. While he thinks that crypto has been fighting with one hand tied behind its back during the past four years and has faced a lot of regulatory unclarity, the scenario has shifted 180 degrees with a positive regulatory environment to look forward to. Finally, Hougan calls the market a win-win post-election. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, he states that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025, considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street, we first utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the major crypto companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest upside potential, as of November 12. The 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street have been arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). People using the Cash App paying for goods and services, highlighting the impact the of the company's payment tools. Average Upside Potential: 8.25% Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a technology company that focuses on financial services and helps expand access to the economy. Block comprises Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD. Square offers an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers to grow their business while Cash App allows sending, spending, or investing money in stocks or bitcoin. Spiral advances the use of Bitcoin by building and funding free, open-source projects whereas TIDAL is a platform for musicians and their fans. TBD eases access to Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. Block, Inc.’s (NYSE:SQ) growth remains at scale with rising profitability. The core businesses are robust with adjusted operating income margins growing significantly for both Square and Cash App. The firm has also expanded its addressable market over time. With Square representing a nearly $130 billion gross profit opportunity and Cash App representing a nearly $75 billion gross profit opportunity in the US, the market potential is strong. The strong profitable growth across Block depicts that its ecosystems are efficiently delivering differentiated value to its customers. The firm has also shifted to a functional organizational structure to improve collaboration across ecosystems. In the third quarter, the firm’s gross profit rose 19% year-over-year to $2.25 billion. Square generated a gross profit of $932 million, up 16% year-over-year, due to strength in its software and integrated payments and banking products. Cash App generated a gross profit of $1.31 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, and BNPL platform. Overall, the firm delivered year-over-year improvement across all profitability measures including adjusted EBITDA. The company’s potential for continued growth and profitability across its key businesses, its ability to generate substantial free cash flow, and its strategic shift to a functional organizational structure make it attractive to investors. Overall SQ ranks 11th on our list of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Search, Blackrock, iBit, BTF, Bitcoin ETF fund surpassing their gold one?

Written by in . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has recently surpassed its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in assets under management (AUM). As of November 7, 2024, IBIT’s AUM reached $33.17 billion, slightly exceeding IAU’s $32.96 billion. This milestone is notable given that IBIT was launched in January 2024, while IAU has been available since 2005. The rapid growth of IBIT reflects increasing investor interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset. The surge in IBIT’s AUM coincides with a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price, which has recently reached new all-time highs. This trend suggests a growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional financial instruments. In comparison, ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, has also experienced growth but remains smaller in AUM compared to BlackRock’s IBIT. The surpassing of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin ETF highlights a shift in investor preferences toward digital assets. This development underscores the evolving landscape of investment strategies and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. I’m the number 1 idea supplier!

Title: Kathleen Watkins: Funeral Mass remembers a woman whose life was a ‘hymn of love’

Kathleen Watkins lived “the wonderful life”, her daughter told her funeral Mass. Ms Watkins, a broadcaster, harpist, singer and children’s author, died at the age of 90 last week. On Tuesday, her remains journeyed from Howth, where she originally lived with her late husband Gay Byrne, to the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, next door to the RTÉ campus where both had groundbreaking careers. Her life was dominated by the four Fs, her daughter Suzy O’Byrne told the congregation: family, friendship, faith and fun. She was known as Kathleen to her husband and to the wider public; Kit to her friends and family; and Nana Kit to her five grandchildren, a title she bestowed on herself when she became a grandmother in 2004. [ Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: She loved life, poetry and Gaybo. Conversation flowed from her like musicOpens in new window ] “It is this wonderful life we celebrate today – a life truly lived to the full, a woman who developed all of her talents, but remained interested in learning,” Ms O’Byrne said in her funeral eulogy. She was first and foremost a wife and mother. Gay Byrne “quite simply adored mum”, Ms O’Byrne said. She had created a sanctuary for him at home and did the lion’s share of the parenting. Their lives together were “relentless” and her support for her husband “unwavering”. “‘You must understand,’ she told us. ‘Everybody wants a piece of your father.’” She had persuaded him to come out of retirement and start broadcasting again. She had a huge interest in children and always gave her time to them. She had been in and out of the Blackrock Clinic for the past year but was always cheerful and she valued her friendships to the end of her life. In his sermon, Fr Leonard Moloney, the Irish Jesuit Provincial who had also been the chief celebrant at her husband’s funeral Mass in 2019, said Ireland had no monarchy but if there had been one, it would have been Gay Byrne and Kathleen Watkins. [ Kathleen Watkins, broadcaster and author, has died aged 90Opens in new window ] They had been a beloved fixture of Irish life for decades. They had made friends the length and breadth of Ireland, many of whom joined them on holidays in Donegal, he explained. The Mass booklet featured the now well-known photograph of her in the car driving off from her husband’s funeral in 2019 applauded away from the steps of the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin by a large crowd led by President Michael D Higgins and then taoiseach Leo Varadkar. She was the first female broadcaster on RTÉ, and the first and only woman to present the Rose of Tralee. Yet, she was an “ordinary” woman, Fr Moloney said, “but only in the best sense of that word. She was so talented, but she was not egotistical or egocentrical.” That extended to her dying wish that no symbols of her life be placed on the altar other than a crucifix and a Bible. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] “Why? She didn’t want anything to distract from the Mass. In her being ordinary, she really was extraordinary. Her life was a hymn of love. She was a woman of empathy and compassion.” Her grandchild Cian O’Byrne said Nana Kit had lived under two abiding principles. One was to give people time “which is the most precious gift at all” and to always give people the benefit of the doubt because you do not know what they are going through. “We take this opportunity today to thank Nana Kit for her time, her joy and her unconditional love and support and most of all her friendship,” he said. Music was provided by Frank McNamara, a long-time music director of the Late Late Show, the soprano Claudia Boyle, the oboe musician David Agnew and the Lassus Scholars. The harp was played by her niece, Sadhbh O’Byrne, Ms Watkins having been a harpist before she met her husband. In the congregation, RTÉ was represented by director-general Kevin Bakhurst. Broadcasters Joe Duffy, Dave Fanning and Mary Kennedy were present alongside John McColgan and his wife, former RTÉ board chairman, Moya Doherty; the entrepreneur Harry Crosbie; and Ballymaloe founder Darina Allen.

A psychiatrist has told a High Court jury she diagnosed a woman with “severe” post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) some two years after being allegedly sexually assaulted by Conor McGregor. Dr Ann Leader said she formed that opinion in December 2020 in relation to Nikita Hand, who has alleged Mr McGregor sexually assaulted her on December 9th 2018. Her opinion was based on reading Ms Hand’s 150-page statement to gardaí, notes of counselling sessions with Ms Hand on several dates during 2019 and 2020, Ms Hand’s medical records and examining Ms Hand herself. Ms Hand provided an account of rape, constant nightmares, panic attacks, detachment from friends, was worried photos of her bruised body may be circulating on line, and felt her daughter and partner were also suffering, the witness said. Ms Hand had said she had no memory of alleged consensual sex with a second man on the day of the alleged rape and described feeling “like a lump of meat”. Dr Leader gave evidence on Tuesday, the fifth day of the civil action by Ms Hand (35), a hair colourist, against Mr McGregor and James Lawrence, of Rafters Road, Drimnagh. Ms Hand is seeking damages for alleged separate sexual assaults of her by both men in Dublin’s Beacon Hotel on December 9th 2018. Both respondents have denied her claims. The jury has heard Ms Hand drank alcohol and took cocaine while at her Christmas work party on the night of December 8th 2018 and continued partying into December 9th. CCTV footage showed Ms Hand, a female friend, Mr McGregor and Mr Lawrence arriving at the Beacon hotel about 12.30pm, Mr McGregor leaving with her friend around 6.13pm, and Ms Hand and Mr Lawrence leaving around 10.30pm. In evidence on Tuesday, Dr Leader said, having carried out a mental state examination of Ms Hand in December 2020, her opinion was Ms Hand was traumatised. She diagnosed Ms Hand with severe PTSD, a psychiatric condition. Ms Hand, she said, had pronounced symptoms of PTSD including nightmares, flashbacks, wanting to die, inability to function normally and feeling dirty, ashamed and guilty. She needed, and was getting, appropriate treatment for PTSD. On review in March 2024, she considered Ms Hand had improved but still had fluctuating symptoms of PTSD. In cross-examination, Dr Leader agreed with Remy Farrell SC, for Mr McGregor, she did not have regard to CCTV when forming her opinion. Ms Hand had anxiety symptoms about 2018 in relation to lifestyle/work stresses for which she was prescribed medication and had counselling, she said. She did not have PTSD then, Dr Leader added. The court also heard evidence from Eithne Scully, a paramedic, said she examined Ms Hand on the morning of December 10th 2018 before she was taken by ambulance to the Rotunda hospital sexual assault unit. Ms Hand’s chief concern was about a tampon “that had been pushed up way too far”. She had a small cut on her chin, there appeared to be some bruising around her lower neck and bruising around her chest, abdomen, buttocks and thighs. “I had not actually seen someone so bruised in a long time.” Ms Hand told her she had been grabbed around the neck and said something about fighting somebody off and there was a threat made, Ms Scully said. Ms Hand did not name her attacker, she said. Dr Frank Clarke, a GP at Walkinstown medical centre, said Ms Hand was a patient there over some 20 years. She had a history over many years of being an anxious person and was treated with serotonin medication. He certified her as unfit for work from May 5th 2019 and provided reports following the alleged assaults. Ms Hand had suffered serious physical and psychological injury and has significant ongoing distressing symptoms due to PTSD which will require ongoing treatment, he said. In cross-examination, he agreed with Mr Farrell, in relation to most cases of PTSD, doctors rely on a patient’s reporting of an event. Detective Sergeant Peter Woods told Ray Boland SC, for Ms Hand, he was stationed at Blackrock Garda station in 2019 and involved in investigating the alleged assault of Ms Hand. She gave him certain information on January 11th 2019 and he took possession of a black jump suit she had worn on December 9th 2018. The jump suit was shown to the jury. He agreed Conor McGregor was arrested by arrangement at the Garda station on January 17th 2019 for the alleged rape of Ms Hand on December 9th 2018. At that point, the judge asked the jury to go out while discussion on legal issues took place. When the jury returned, the judge asked them to return to court on Wednesday when he said it was expected, after some further evidence, the plaintiff’s case would close and the next stage of the case would begin.

Title: Jim Cramer on Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): ‘This One Will Do Best’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market’s reaction to the election results. He noted that the trading session on November 6 was largely influenced by a collective sigh of relief from traders who were glad the election was over. With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office, many were preparing for the shifts his administration could bring. Cramer pointed out that the market responded positively to Trump’s victory, stating: “The market likes Donald J. Trump and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both and we had a monster-buying celebration. It was a bull jailbreak and the bears never knew what trampled them.” Cramer reflected on the uncertainty leading up to the election, with many investors fearing a prolonged and contentious process. But with the winner now clear, Cramer argued that the market is better off knowing what lies ahead. He remarked: “Let’s understand that many people thought we’d have a contested election, which would cause tremendous uncertainty. The fact that we already know the winner is a huge win for the stock market in itself, which makes it a magnet for new money. This election, with its vicious maelstrom of hate and fear, is finally over.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins and Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch One of Cramer's main focuses was Trump's proposed tax cuts, which he believes will have a substantial impact on corporate profits. Cramer emphasized that the tax cuts are expected to boost earnings, particularly by lowering corporate tax rates, which would directly increase profit estimates and earnings per share. Cramer also highlighted the importance of maintaining low interest rates for these benefits to materialize. He cautioned that while the current environment might feel like a party, there could be risks down the line, especially as debt continues to grow. Despite these concerns, Cramer seemed optimistic, suggesting that the market could continue to rally as long as interest rates stay low and corporate tax cuts come to fruition. However, Cramer also pointed out a potential complication and commented: “We also have to accept that we will have another earning season right at the time of the inauguration. So we'll have to worry about those earnings too, but not yet.” Additionally, Cramer suggested that there could be more significant market moves in the near future, especially if President-elect Trump makes comments about the Federal Reserve that investors find unsettling. He said that such remarks could trigger a negative reaction from the market, potentially leading to a downturn before things settle again. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 6 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Cramer acknowledged that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is a popular stock and commented that it will perform well. “There's a sense that a Trump presidency will bring more hacks. Probably won't, though. This one will do best, Palantir. It's upending the Pentagon procurement process and making it possible for us to play offense when it comes to cybersecurity. President-elect Trump's gonna have a lot of fun with Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir… [It] can go much higher, I don't care about the valuation. I know it's a popular stock. It can go higher.” Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a prominent developer of software platforms specializing in complex data integration and decision-making. The company primarily serves government agencies, particularly in the intelligence sector, as well as commercial clients. Over the years, the company has made significant strides in positioning itself as one of the key beneficiaries of the growing demand for AI technologies, largely through its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). This focus on AI innovation has helped the company gain recognition as a leader in the field. For the third quarter, CEO Alex Karp credited Palantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) success to the continued and "unwavering" demand for its AI products, which he sees as a promising indicator of future growth. The company’s performance was especially strong in the U.S., where revenue rose 44%, reaching $499 million. The U.S. commercial segment was a particularly bright spot, showing a 54% jump in revenue to $179 million. Overall PLTR ranks 14th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New Dublin brewery backed by some of Ireland’s top publicans, with two beers in initial launch

A new €1.8 million brewery backed by the families behind some of the country’s best-known pubs has been launched in Dublin. Changing Times Brewery is based in Glasnevin, along the banks of the Royal Canal, and will initially employ nine people, with two full-time positions and seven other roles. Its backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of popular bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. The backers said the idea for the brewery came from listening to feedback from customers over a number of years, which led to conversations between the publican families, and eventually detailed discussions on creating their own brewery. [ Electric Picnic vs craft beer: how Irish microbreweries are fighting back against the industry’s biggest playersOpens in new window ] The brewery’s products will be stocked in The Palace; The Long Hall; The Swan; The Bankers; Arthur Maynes in Donnybrook; Devitts; Doheny & Nesbitts; Sheehans; Lemon and Duke; The Bridge 1859; The Blackrock; The Bank; McSorleys; Darkey Kelly’s; and The Ferryman. The brewery will initially provide two products – Daydreamer Lager and After Hours Pale Ale – but hopes to expand its product range early next year. The products are also expected to be expanded to additional pubs in the coming weeks. Mr Aherne of The Palace said the brewery was set up to “give pub goers something new and something locally brewed”. “Our customers were saying they were in the mood for change and that we should be brewing our own range of beers,” he said. “We listened and took note. This led to conversations with other families of publicans, whose customers were saying the same things and eventually we decided to create this brewery so we could make those customer suggestions a reality. [ Roe & Co toasts Palace Bar bicentenaryOpens in new window ] “Effectively, the concept for Changing Times Brewery was born over the pub counters. We look forward to giving our customers a taste of that something new, that change they have been looking for.” Speaking of the concept behind the name, Mr Sheehan of Sheehans Pub said: “Change has been good for modern Ireland. We’re no longer a country that is stuck in our ways or who does things just because that’s the way they have always been done. That is the spirit behind Changing Times – there’s always time for something new. We wanted to address those changing tastes with this brewery.” Brewer Shane Long said the products were brewed using “quality Irish ingredients from the best producers”. “Combining high-calibre hops, barley, malt, yeast and more with the insights of our customers, we’ve been able to develop draught with a great taste that we believe will help change people’s minds and become their regular pint,” he added.

Title: Bitcoin rally slows as it nears $90,000 — now with a bigger market cap than silver
URL: https://qz.com/bitcoin-rally-btc-crypto-market-cap-silver-gold-assets-1851695613
Time Published: 2024-11-12T12:59:00Z
Full Content:
On the heels of a rally sparked by Donald Trump’s presidential election win, Bitcoin’s price is finally moderating — but not before beating out silver to become the eighth largest asset in the world. As of Tuesday morning, the leading cryptocurrency was valued at about $86,900, giving it a market capitalization of $1.72 trillion. That gives it a lead on silver’s $1.71 trillion market cap, but still falls well short of gold’s estimated $17.52 trillion. Bitcoin’s price had risen 5.6% over the prior 24 hours, adding to a rally that saw its value surge 30% in less than a week and hit several new record highs. Bitcoin is expected to continue barreling forward as investors’ optimism and enthusiasm grows on Trump’s return to the White House. Some analysts say Bitcoin could even cross the $100,000 threshold as a result. That seems increasingly likely as it nears the $90,000 mark, with six weeks to go before year’s end. Starting in January, crypto fans and investors will — for the first time ever — have a friendly face in the Oval Office. Throughout his campaign, Trump took an unprecedented pro-Bitcoin stance, championing the digital currency as a symbol of financial independence and an alternative to traditional banking. Labeling himself as the “crypto candidate,” Trump fully embraced digital assets, even accepting donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana. Trump also attended and addressed a Bitcoin conference in July, where he touted a commitment to positioning America at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Among other promises to the crypto industry on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to create a national Bitcoin reserve, as well as a “Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” “The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” he said. Following Trump’s election win last week, investors began pouring cash into spot Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. On Thursday alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK-0.52%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with more than $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs have lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across a number of other digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was priced at more than $3,200 as of Tuesday morning, and Dogecoin jumped 30% in the past 24 hours. Others, including Solana and Cardano, have taken a tumble. All together, the global crypto market has a valuation of $2.91 trillion, a 4.09% increase in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. — Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Title: Bitcoin bull run could continue for 200 days before possible US recession – Report

As Bitcoin reaches day 554 of its cycle, Copper.co suggests a peak is aligned with potential mid-2025 US recession forecasts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s current market cycle indicates a potential peak in about 200 days, coinciding with forecasts of a possible US recession by mid-2025. According to recent research from Copper.co, this alignment emerges as Bitcoin reaches day 554 of its cycle. Historically, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days from the point when the annual average growth of its market capitalization turns positive until it hits a price peak. Copper.co assesses that the present cycle began around mid-2023, shortly before BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Bitcoin could peak around mid-2025, approximately 200 days from now, if the pattern holds. Copper.co uses JPMorgan’s estimate of a 45% chance of a US recession occurring in the second half of 2025 to showcase a potential overlap of Bitcoin’s peak with economic downturn predictions, adding a layer of complexity to market expectations. Investors may find this intersection significant when considering portfolio strategies amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Realized volatility for Bitcoin currently stands at 50%, reflecting the standard deviation of returns from the market’s mean return. Implied volatility, which gauges market expectations for future volatility, recently hit its highest level of the year. This suggests ongoing market turbulence as 2025 approaches, with a possible bullish undertone influencing trading behaviors. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60, significantly lower than previous bull market highs. Copper.co’s report highlights that by extending the RSI’s look-back period to four years—a timeframe that reduces short-term noise—the indicator shows substantial room for growth. This metric implies that Bitcoin could build momentum into the new year, potentially reaching higher valuation levels. Inactive Bitcoin supply, representing coins held without movement for extended periods, is increasing amid record prices. This trend indicates that long-term holders maintain their positions, but vigilance is advised. Should these investors begin to move assets, it could signal shifts in market forces or profit-taking activities. Per Copper.co’s analysis, combining these factors paints a nuanced picture of Bitcoin’s trajectory. The interplay between market cycles, volatility measures, and macroeconomic forecasts illustrates the importance of monitoring multiple indicators.

Title: Ajay Banga

Ajay Banga didn’t like the existing decor, so when he took over as World Bank president he gave his grand two-story corner office a makeover. Old-school leather furniture? Gone. Dark lighting that made the space feel like a dungeon? Replaced. And a depressing painting? Swapped out for three framed motivational quotes: “Question everything always,” “Done is better than perfect,” and “Fail harder.” “They are kind of my philosophy of working,” he tells me only moments after my walking in the door. My conversation with Banga at the World Bank’s Washington, D.C., headquarters dug into the wonkiest details of climate finance, from the role portfolio guarantees can play in reducing credit risk to the investment challenges posed by volatile currencies in emerging markets. But his quick office tour offered just as much insight about his approach to running the world’s most important development bank: seemingly small tweaks can make a huge difference. Banga entered office in 2023 after his controversial predecessor, David Malpass, was forced to resign following controversial remarks that seemed to doubt the science of climate change. Many environmentalists called for a full-scale revamp of the 80-year-old World Bank and other international financial institutions. The bank’s most powerful members—including and especially the U.S.—have also pushed for a greater focus on climate while stopping short of endorsing some of the boldest efforts to remake the institution. Banga has approached the task judiciously. Under his leadership, the bank has added climate to its mission statement. To implement his agenda, he has pursued a range of seemingly small reforms that can have a big impact accelerating global climate action and intertwining it with the bank’s long-standing development agenda. He has tweaked the rules about how much the World Bank can lend, freeing up space to finance more climate projects. He has sought to integrate climate change into other development programs, from agriculture to education. And he has worked closely with the private sector in hopes that companies will step up to invest the lion’s share of the trillions of dollars needed to pay for expanding clean energy in the Global South. “There’s a whole Rubik’s Cube to be solved,” he says. “If it begins to make sense numerically, money does flood in.” This work comes as the focus of the global climate conversation increasingly turns toward finance—both for the energy transition and the adaptation needed to prepare communities around the world for the increasingly dire effects of rising temperatures. Research has found that emerging markets and developing countries need to spend upwards of $2 trillion annually to meet global climate goals. And at the annual U.N. climate conference—this November known as COP29 and held in Baku, Azerbaijan—diplomats from nearly 200 countries are working to hash out a climate-finance deal that lays out how much countries in the Global North will give to help their developing counterparts. The most ambitious proposals call on wealthy nations to provide upwards of a collective $1 trillion each year to the Global South. Banga knows that the World Bank’s work is a critical part of the picture, but he tries not to dwell on it. Getting the small things right first will eventually lead to big changes, he says. “Rather than get bogged down by the trillions,” he says, “work on solutions, and let them build at scale.’” In late October, as finance ministers from around the world flocked to Washington, D.C., for the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Banga darted between conversations on agriculture, gender, and jobs. From a quick glance at his schedule, climate change barely seemed to come up. But actually listening to him talk paints a different picture. At an agriculture dialogue, his announcement to double the bank’s agriculture-finance commitments to $9 billion annually by 2030 included programs for smallholder farmers to incentivize greener practices. His gender strategy links gender inequality with growing weather extremes; simply put, more fragile societies lead to increased risk of gender violence. And he frames investments in jobs and education as a pathway not just to growing economies but also to climate resilience and the deployment of clean energy. In a way, this is a unique feature of how Banga envisions the bank working on climate. He tells me the approach is born of his travels to member countries around the world where he saw how climate change was exacerbating other challenges on the ground, from migration to educational attainment. “It’s intertwined,” he says. “You can’t segregate it.” There’s an element of practicality to this approach too. The World Bank was first founded after World War II to help finance the reconstruction of Europe, and, along with the IMF, has since become a central node in a group of international financial institutions meant to help developing countries grow their economies and get through tough times. And, while the effects of climate change are of dire concern to leaders in the Global South, that’s not the only thing on their minds. Citizens still expect their governments to deliver development—from better roads and bridges to new jobs. And that has been especially challenging in the post-COVID-19 period when strained budgets have left many countries in deep debt. Read More: How to Avoid A Climate Backlash Banga has had to thread a difficult needle—showing member countries that he is committed to the bank’s tried-and-true mission while advancing climate efforts. And so many of his efforts have focused on using existing mechanisms rather than creating new, exclusively climate-focused ones. He adjusted the so-called equity-to-loans ratio, which determines how much the bank can lend, to allow it to lend an additional $30 billion over the next decade. He streamlined bureaucratic processes to cut average project approval time from 19 months to 16. And he used the bank’s profits to start a new Livable Planet Fund, which will be used to cut the costs of financing projects. The results have been significant. The bank’s climate finance deployed neared $43 billion in the last fiscal year. That’s a 10% increase over the prior year and brings it close to reaching its 2025 target of devoting 45% of its financing to climate. And all that money can go even further as it attracts private capital on its coattails. Still, it doesn’t take a math Ph.D. to see that the World Bank won’t be able to fill the massive climate finance gap on its own. The bank manages hundreds of billions of dollars in investments; climate change requires annual investments that measure in the trillions. “There is no way that any amount of financial engineering that I do with the balance sheet ... can get there,” he says. “The reality is everybody has fiscal constraints.” Banga’s solution is private finance. The owners and managers of trillions of dollars in capital have said they want to invest in the energy transition, but a flurry of risks have held them back. “This idea that you can wave a wand and get the private sector to come in ... it’s not how it works,” says Banga. But Banga thinks he can bridge the gap. It makes sense. Before leading the World Bank, Banga had a storied career in the private sector, most notably as the CEO of Mastercard but also in banking and in growth equity. Since taking office, he has launched a Private Sector Investment Lab working with the CEOs of BlackRock, HSBC, and other big financial institutions to work through the biggest challenges holding back private investment, from currency risk to a lack of regulatory certainty. In October, he launched a set of solutions tailored to address those risks. “He fundamentally understands that to take on these big, bold aspirations and actually execute them on a timeline, you have to work outside of your own institution,” says Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which in September joined a World Bank program to provide electricity to 300 million people across Africa. Every World Bank president faces their share of critics. And Banga is no exception. Some fear that his climate initiatives veer too far from the bank’s original mission. Others say his climate work is too piecemeal and too reliant on the private sector. A re-envisioning of the postwar international financial system with new institutions focused solely on climate would better serve us, they say. Banga is aware of all the challenges the bank must navigate, particularly as countries face populist revolts in parts of the world that aren’t too happy about multilateralism. Without my prompting, Banga addresses widespread concern that now-President elect Donald Trump may not like his agenda, saying that his work at the bank is “common sense” and “has nothing to do with politics.” “Smart management of money… Who's going to say no to that?” he asks almost incredulously. “The fact that I'm willing to do more work with the private sector, you really think President Trump will say no to that?” Still, the long-term future of the bank is clearly on his mind. Along with his IMF counterpart, he’s convened a working group to think through some of the big questions. But when I ask him about what the bank may look like in 30 years, he pivots right back into the programmatic changes he’s making today. “Forecasts are not destiny,” he says. “You can change destiny, but you have to work at it.” Write to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com

Title: Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of Bitcoin
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj0wkwv1x2o
Time Published: 2024-11-12T11:05:15Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs. Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin. Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry. But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. 1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. 2. Making history with pizza Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! 3. Becoming legal tender In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. 4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. 5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." 6. Crypto King fraudster No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. 7. Investment bank boom Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen arrested in February, will be allowed abroad to seek medical treatment. Habibur Rahman was charged with running the machine without registration from the FCA. The agreement will put an end to a saga that started when the firm went bankrupt in November 2022. The collection was considered a virtual asset and could not be released, Guernsey Post says. Crypto currency firms are waiting to see how November's vote will impact upon them. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Title: Trump hurls bitcoin near $90,000 — will the rally endure?

Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged without restraint. The President-elect intentionally courted the bitcoin community. But can he make good on his promises? The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was trading near $90,000 (€85,780) on Tuesday, reaching a new high. The record rally began on November 4 after Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the next US president. Jonas Groß, chairman of the Digital Euro Association — an organization that promotes digital payment systems — says Trump has declared himself to be the "crypto president" who will "lead the US to a pioneering role in bitcoin." Such promises have been made so far only by presidents of smaller countries, like [President Nayib Bukele of] El Salvador, Groß told DW. "It's no surprise that the crypto community is celebrating." Though Trump had previously harbored a negative opinion about the cryptocurrency, he suddenly made a U-turn during the 2024 election campaign. At a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, for example, he promised to keep the crypto market largely unregulated and to make energy cheaper for the power-hungry mining of cryptocurrencies. Generating new bitcoins and maintaining the so-called blockchain network on which all transactions are recorded requires significant energy. Co-Pierre Georg, director of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, attributes bitcoin's price surge primarily to "structural factors amplified by the US election." Georg told DW that the approval by US market regulators in January of so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in bitcoin made investing in the coin and other cryptocurrencies much easier. With ETFs, investors can profit from price movements by buying shares without owning bitcoin directly. Georg noted that since regulatory approval, huge amounts of money have flowed into such ETFs, indicating that mainly institutional investors, like the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, are fueling the rally. He said that direct purchases of bitcoin via crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpanda, or Kraken haven't fundamentally changed so much recently. Jonas Groß believes, however, that bitcoin's new all-time high mainly reflects sentiment and trust, similar to other publicly traded assets. While financial fraud dominated the headlines regarding bitcoin in the past, "it just needed a reason to lift spirits and get the machinery running again." Trump's soft regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies has "brought positive sentiment back," he added. Bitcoin's most prominent foe in the US administration is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, a staunch advocate of sweeping cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, Co-Pierre Georg expects Trump to try to reorganize the agency overseeing US financial markets but said the incoming president can't simply replace Gensler without proving specific errors. Georg also sees Trump's win as a victory for the crypto industry lobby. "At the moment, it appears that the industry has bought influence over the government and the new Congress," he said in a reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest man has proven an ardent fan of both cryptocurrencies and Donald Trump, whose campaign he supported with millions of dollars. According to news agency Reuters, the crypto industry spent nearly $120 million on support for Trump and Republican candidates, with a significant portion of the funding dedicated to unseat Senate Banking Committee chairman and crypto critic Sherrod Brown from the Democrats. The campaign of Brown's Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, was reportedly supported with industry donations of about $40 million. While in the past, bitcoin broke records mainly in the wake of major companies accepting it as payment, such as PayPal in 2020, Georg sees "no such reasons" at the moment. "Bitcoin is completely unsuitable for payments, and it's also not reliable as a stable investment. The only real reason to buy bitcoin is speculative." Jonas Groß is less skeptical, seeing some market fundamentals currently favoring the asset. "Bitcoin has established itself as a new asset class. The first pension funds are already investing, and in my view, it's only a matter of time before the first sovereign wealth funds enter the space. And then we're talking about an entirely different scale," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Noting that markets have already "priced in Trump's promises," he warned, however: "If it turns out he doesn't deliver, prices could of course fall again." For Co-Pierre Georg, predicting if the rally will continue under Trump is "like reading tea leaves." With bitcoin, he said, "you should only invest what you're prepared to lose completely." Moreover, he's wondering about the crypto industry and what it says that it "so strongly supports the election of a convicted criminal and political firebrand like Donald Trump, and then massively profits from his win."

On Monday morning, the research firm Bernstein came out with some advice about crypto for its Wall Street clients: “Buy everything you can.” Ever since the invention of bitcoin 15 years ago, this would be the kind of bloodshot, crazy-eyed call you could ignore because it was coming from a fanatic. But Bernstein is not some crypto-pilled boiler-room operation. Rather, it is part of the staid French investment bank Societe Generale and traces its history back to the 1960s, when the U.S. was still on the gold standard. The paper immediately ricocheted around the finance industry. When I started writing this column, bitcoin was testing new highs above $82,000; by the time I finished, it had eclipsed $88,000. When you look at the sheer volume of trading, it was probably crypto’s biggest day ever. Welcome to crypto’s Donald Trump era. It has hardly been a week since Trump won election, but it looks increasingly likely that the next four years in cryptoland are going to make the time when Sam Bankman-Fried was the industry’s fuzzy-headed mascot appear tame by comparison. What happened? It is not that there was some mass conversion event among Wall Street’s most cynical moneymen to the utopian promises of the digital future. There has been no new invention, no new use discovered that would make bitcoin or any other digital currency more likely to be a part of your everyday life. The calculus here is that all the insanity of the pandemic-era boom can come back in force — and this time, like Trump, the industry is emboldened to get even bigger, richer, and more unabashed than it ever has before. There’s no guarantee that bitcoin, or any other digital token, will be worth more tomorrow than it is right now. Volatility and sky-high risk is a central part of investing in crypto, and that didn’t change on November 6. But crypto in 2025 is looking like it is the industry’s best chance to make itself into something bigger than just a financial sideshow — for the next four years, the industry is absolutely looking to make itself institutional. The coming Trump economy, if it looks anything like the last one, is going to be very good for business, with lower taxes and interest rates, freeing up more money for people to speculate. And the industry has already made it as easy to buy crypto as anything else available on the New York Stock Exchange. Which, broadly speaking, has meant more money coming into the space, bringing rising prices and dampened volatility. Ever since this winter, when regulators allowed 401(k) money to flow into bitcoin ETFs, giants like BlackRock have been acting as a bridge between the traditional and digital worlds of finance — which has, in turn, only served to make crypto that much larger. The biggest break from the Biden administration, though, is likely going to be how much the industry is going to police itself. That is at least partly a function of an extremely aggressive lobbying campaign. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — the largest U.S. crypto exchange — made a wager that he could marshal more than $100 million from his industry to elect a crypto-friendly government — and he ended up with a historic streak of wins that rivals some of the all-time great Wall Street trades. Bloomberg tallies that out of the 48 races where crypto money was backing a candidate, the industry has won every single won. (There are eight remaining, and all but three seem to be breaking toward the industry). Washington, D.C.’s most powerful bulwarks against the industry, including Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, are losing their jobs. The winners, like Brown’s successor Bernie Moreno, are openly pushing for crypto to get the laissez-faire treatment. One senator, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, has introduced a bill that would require the Treasury to buy and hold onto a “strategic reserve” of 1 million bitcoins for 20 years — putting the U.S. more in line with El Salvador, which has tried, and mostly failed, to integrate the asset into everyday life. It’s not just lawmakers. Howard Lutnick, who is overseeing Trump’s personnel staffing, is the CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald — which just happens to be where Tether, the lifeblood stablecoin of the crypto industry, keeps its money. Elon Musk, who bankrolled at least $119 million of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations, is a major crypto proponent — especially the joke dogecoin — and Tesla owns vast stores of bitcoin. (His vow to oversee a Department Of Government Efficiency to root out public spending is, I am sorry to say, a crypto joke). Of course, the first Trump administration oversaw a wild crypto bull market in 2017 and, at the time, prosecuted plenty of scams and frauds. What the crypto industry complains the most about these days is that the federal government doesn’t make crypto-specific rules, and that it uses the courts to set policy. Nevermind that this practice originated under Trump, back when he wrote he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” But since July, when Trump promised at the annual bitcoin conference to ax Gensler and make the U.S. the global center of crypto, his late-in-life conversion was accepted by the industry without much of a second thought. This is essentially what Bernstein and many others on Wall Street are excited about: putting money into a relatively new asset class now that regulators and federal prosecutors seem ready to let it grow. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, a tech company that holds $10 billion in bitcoin, went vertical on Monday. The total market for all of crypto was within a breath of reaching $3 trillion — about the size of France’s economy. In fact, the only digital asset to lose money among the largest 100 was Monero — a cryptocurrency favored by the likes of North Korea because it is so useful for laundering large sums of money. (The first Trump administration had prosecuted a multi-decade low of white-collar crimes, after all, so it’s not clear that money laundering would be much of a priority.) Last year, the Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux (who’s a friend of mine) published a book called Number Go Up about the various scams and frauds that crypto facilitates. The title of the book comes from a quote by Dan Held, an executive at a crypto exchange, who was quoting — in earnest, apparently — a sarcastic meme about crypto. “Number go up technology is a very powerful piece of technology,” he said, according to the book. “It’s the price. As the price goes higher, more people are aware of it, and buy it in anticipation of the price continuing to climb.” Of course, what he’s describing has paved the way for many of the Ponzi-esque schemes that have defined the crypto industry so far, not least of which was the collapse of SBF’s crypto empire. (Not for nothing, FTX, his exchange, was based in the Bahamas, which has notoriously hands-off and crypto-friendly laws. They’ve since backtracked.) Crypto’s doubters have continued to make the same case against it over and over again: that digital assets make for a slow and expensive form of money, and that their best use is either in speculation or crime. Perhaps, over the long run, all this speculation will make for another FTX-like crash — this one even bigger than the last one. But for now, the crypto bros are going to go absolutely ape.

The biggest break from the Biden administration, though, is likely going to be how much the industry is going to police itself. That is at least partly a function of an extremely aggressive lobbying campaign. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — the largest U.S. crypto exchange — made a wager that he could marshal more than $100 million from his industry to elect a crypto-friendly government — and he ended up with a historic streak of wins that rivals some of the all-time great Wall Street trades. Bloomberg tallies that out of the 48 races where crypto money was backing a candidate, the industry has won every single won. (There are eight remaining, and all but three seem to be breaking toward the industry). Washington, D.C.’s most powerful bulwarks against the industry, including Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, are losing their jobs. The winners, like Brown’s successor Bernie Moreno, are openly pushing for crypto to get the laissez-faire treatment. One senator, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, has introduced a bill that would require the Treasury to buy and hold onto a “strategic reserve” of 1 million bitcoins for 20 years — putting the U.S. more in line with El Salvador, which has tried, and mostly failed, to integrate the asset into everyday life. It’s not just lawmakers. Howard Lutnick, who is overseeing Trump’s personnel staffing, is the CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald — which just happens to be where Tether, the lifeblood stablecoin of the crypto industry, keeps its money. Elon Musk, who bankrolled at least $119 million of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations, is a major crypto proponent — especially the joke dogecoin — and Tesla owns vast stores of bitcoin. (His vow to oversee a Department Of Government Efficiency to root out public spending is, I am sorry to say, a crypto joke). Of course, the first Trump administration oversaw a wild crypto bull market in 2017 and, at the time, prosecuted plenty of scams and frauds. What the crypto industry complains the most about these days is that the federal government doesn’t make crypto-specific rules, and that it uses the courts to set policy. Nevermind that this practice originated under Trump, back when he wrote he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” But since July, when Trump promised at the annual bitcoin conference to ax Gensler and make the U.S. the global center of crypto, his late-in-life conversion was accepted by the industry without much of a second thought. This is essentially what Bernstein and many others on Wall Street are excited about: putting money into a relatively new asset class now that regulators and federal prosecutors seem ready to let it grow. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, a tech company that holds $10 billion in bitcoin, went vertical on Monday. The total market for all of crypto was within a breath of reaching $3 trillion — about the size of France’s economy. In fact, the only digital asset to lose money among the largest 100 was Monero — a cryptocurrency favored by the likes of North Korea because it is so useful for laundering large sums of money. (The first Trump administration had prosecuted a multi-decade low of white-collar crimes, after all, so it’s not clear that money laundering would be much of a priority.) Last year, the Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux (who’s a friend of mine) published a book called Number Go Up about the various scams and frauds that crypto facilitates. The title of the book comes from a quote by Dan Held, an executive at a crypto exchange, who was quoting — in earnest, apparently — a sarcastic meme about crypto. “Number go up technology is a very powerful piece of technology,” he said, according to the book. “It’s the price. As the price goes higher, more people are aware of it, and buy it in anticipation of the price continuing to climb.” Of course, what he’s describing has paved the way for many of the Ponzi-esque schemes that have defined the crypto industry so far, not least of which was the collapse of SBF’s crypto empire. (Not for nothing, FTX, his exchange, was based in the Bahamas, which has notoriously hands-off and crypto-friendly laws. They’ve since backtracked.) Crypto’s doubters have continued to make the same case against it over and over again: that digital assets make for a slow and expensive form of money, and that their best use is either in speculation or crime. Perhaps, over the long run, all this speculation will make for another FTX-like crash — this one even bigger than the last one. But for now, the crypto bros are going to go absolutely ape.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs pull in $3.4 billion since US Election amid another $1 billion day

Rising Bitcoin ETF investments signal institutional FOMO and market confidence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted $3.4 billion in inflows over the past four days, according to Farside data. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, reported significant investments in their Bitcoin ETFs, indicating heightened institutional interest. On Nov. 7, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF saw an inflow of $1.12 billion, marking the largest single-day investment among the ETFs listed. These inflows come in the wake of the US Election, in which Donald Trump’s victory helped push Bitcoin toward $90,000. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also recorded notable inflows since the election of $666 million and $178 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued to attract investments, adding $61 million. Other financial firms, such as Ark Invest, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree, contributed to the rising inflows. On Nov. 11, Ark’s ARKB ETF received $42.7 million, while Invesco’s BTCO added $108.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with $756 million. These firms’ participation underlines a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial markets. Substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect growing confidence among institutional investors in cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Possible FOMO among US investors who have seen adverts from the likes of BlackRock, Bitwise, et al over the past year could also be impacting investments as Trump’s reelection spurs increased attention to the digital asset.

Title: Here are 33 places to eat in Ireland that readers say are good value

When it comes to highlighting rip-offs, Pricewatch is not to be found wanting – we hope – but we believe it is also important to support local businesses and to acknowledge that there are many, many restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels all over the country that are offering good value for money in very difficult circumstances. These businesses are also bringing jobs and money and life into all our communities unlike, say, many of the blue chip big tech companies that concentrate their presence in and around big urban centres. And the hospitality sector does more than that. It is also a magnet for the millions of tourists who travel to Ireland, not many of whom complain about rip-off prices, incidentally. Bearing all that in mind, we took to the platform formerly known as Twitter last week and asked people for examples of good value across the hospitality sector. We were heartened by the volume of responses and positivity that flowed our way. Here is just a sample of what came back. Blackrock Market: Lebanese Tapas offers delicious home-made Falafel and hummus. Really good value and the best coffee too. – Elaine Banfield Pizzas of Heart, Youghal: A young family from Naples giving us great value for money. €10-€13 for an oven fired freshly made pizza. They work out of their own mobile kitchen which changes location from the beach to the GAA club. – Michael John Howard Kenny’s pub on James’s Street, Dublin: Went there on a random Monday earlier this year. Pint of Guinness was only €5 and there was not one but two Elvis impersonators. – Ian Begley Timeless Cafe in Kilcock: Lunch for four yesterday including drinks and coffee was €40. Don’t get that value around these parts often. – Meadhbh Charles Sligo: Three tapas dishes for €12 at Osta Cafe and excellent (free) music Thursday evenings. And across the river, low price menu at Oak Moon evening cafe Thursday to Saturday. – Richard O’Beirne Stranorlar: Our local Kees Hotel has great offers including B&B plus dinner for €56 per person sharing. – Angela Holohan Gorey, Co Wexford: Partridges on Main Street. Had the most delicious chicken curry. Boss had butter chicken and chips. €34 for both. Lovely staff and food was really good, for a coffee shop. – Dave O’Connor Donegal: Any of the three bars on Arranmore Island – Neilys, Phil Bans and Earlys – offer great value on the price of pint and Earlys has great value pub grub with local fish dish a speciality. Neilys offers a beer token when you want to buy someone a drink, they can redeem it whenever. – Stephen McDevitt Bishopstown: My sister and I had a toasted sandwich each with three fillings, a decaf tea and a flat white for €13 total in Dunnes cafe in Bishopstown last Tuesday. Staff were helpful and friendly despite it being lunchtime and midterm. Kids meal for €2. Simple but very tasty. – Paula Courtney Bray: I’m usually fickle and want to try new places, but I keep going back to Dockyard No 8 in Bray over the past few years. Excellent value food with proper portions, enticing menu, great atmosphere and friendly, efficient service. Dog-friendly downstairs. – Peter McGuire Dalkey: You can buy an Americano in Robertos for €2.50 if you bring your own keep cup, €3 if no cup which is still great value compared with many other coffee shops. – Emma Forsyth Drury Street, Dublin: Heartbreak Social Club for €2 coffees, no matter what you get (alt milk is extra) but it’s delicious coffee from Pine Cone Coffee Roasters. I don’t think you’ll find coffee at that quality cheaper anywhere else. – Ger Holland Macroom: Great carvery lunch in Castle Hotel. Mains €18, best quality seasonal foods, excellently cooked. Great service also. Now that the town is bypassed, it’s worth a visit for food, traditional drapery shops, etc. (Visited on Bank Holiday Monday last.) – Margaret Kent Dublin: The Silk Road Cafe in the Chester Beatty. Delicious, Middle Eastern food at very reasonable prices. Lovely, helpful staff too. – Gillian Monaghan Galway: The Galleon in Salthill. It’s almost an institution. Remember being brought in there as a child for a knickerbocker glory. Brought my own kids when they were younger and it’s still going strong. Simple food and great service always. – Edel Abberton Stoneybatter: Bismarck Store Dairy Parlour, €3.10 for a keepcup latte. Tasty coffee, chatty owner and great value. – Aideen Lawlor Wicklow town: The Jailer’s Rest is the best value around. Four full breakfasts with tea, coffee and toast included was €53 this morning. – Anne Marie McGovern Wexford: Kafe Konnect in Wexford town. Social enterprise with all day mega breakfast for less than a tenner, including lovely coffee, toast, etc. Main courses also less than a tenner. Plus social impact and excellent service, so phenomenal value. – Marie Laoise Ni Bhroin Co Westmeath: Genesis cafe just outside Mullingar. Wonderful food. Good prices and the very best service. – Mary Healy Trim: I got a great deal in Knightsbrook Hotel for December, €149 bed and breakfast plus three-course dinner for two. – Irene Cullen Co Mayo: Johnny Moran’s pub in Westport, €5 for a pint of the black stuff. Gem of a pub in the centre of town. – Kieran O’Hara Wicklow: We ate in the Brass Fox Pub over the midterm. Fantastic value for kids for a main course, drink and ice-cream only €10. Really good service and quality food. – Michael Fennelly. Skerries: The Gladstone, a pub in Skerries, Co Dublin, €5.20 for a lovely pint of Guinness. Other pubs in the town are charging €6.50. – Hugh Derham Tralee: The Daily Grind offers great service, coffee, food, atmosphere – the beating heart of Tralee for the past 10 years. – Gráinne McPollin Gorey: Amber Springs Hotel, two main meals, two kids’ meals, two glasses of wine and squash for the children for €60, with lots of great facilities on site too. – Christine van der Kamp Tuam: The Front Room Bar and Restaurant. Meal for three people yesterday, starters and mains, €54. Food was excellent and really good value for money. – Claire Dillon Abbeyleix: Mueller and O’Connell Bakery, a special bakery and coffee shop adored by the community. They make amazing sourdough bread, sausage rolls and delicious pastries. – Denis O’Leary Clifden: Station Hotel, dinner, B&B and bottle wine €240 per couple, full a la carte menu and the wine option was €30 towards your choice of wine, great pool and location, was great value. – Paula Dawson Galway: Hotel Leenane. Great value and lovely food. Two nights B&B for a couple is €180 total. Great staff too. – Dee O’Dwyer Ballinasloe: Bistro 18. €10 lunch menu. And the coffee is good. – Frank Hunt Rathmines: €60 for a lovely two-course meal for two people in Bethlehem. You can bring your own wine. €5 euro corkage. Great service and atmosphere. – Alice Walsh Bray: Nine offers high-quality brunch and lunch (sourdough bread, quality ingredients such as local organic vegetables) for very reasonable prices, in a lovely space. – Michelle Cookson Galway: The Neighbourhood Cafe in Doughiska (opposite Lidl) has excellent food at great prices (eg mini breakfast for €10 which is as big as many “standard” breakfasts I’ve seen. – Joe Desbonney Our weekly personal finance newsletter will give you the insight you need to save money and make smart spending decisions © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Almost $90,000 During Face-Melting Rally

Bitcoin prices neared the $90,000 price level today. Bitcoin prices continued their sharp, upward trajectory on Monday, November 11, approaching $90,000 as the world’s most prominent digital currency attained its latest all-time high. The cryptocurrency, which has been generating substantial visibility and widespread headlines for several years now, reached $89,600, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. To provide an idea of just how rapidly the cryptocurrency has been appreciating over the last several weeks, it was trading close to $62,000 roughly a month ago, additional TradingView figures reveal. Since dropping to that point, the digital asset has rallied more than 40%. Chris Chung, CEO & co-founder of Solana DEX aggregator Titan, emphasized just how strong bitcoin’s upward trend has been lately. “Bitcoin’s all time high and momentum shows no signs of stopping, as continued optimism surrounding the results of the U.S. election continue to drive price movement,” he stated via email. “Traders are deploying their capital and flocking to the safest asset that they are certain will stay around regardless of any drops in the market,” Chung added. The TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O also weighed in. “Bitcoin keeps breaking all time highs since last week, this caused a full blown crypto bull market to begin!” she said through emailed comments. Bitcoin prices are benefiting from multiple tailwinds, and Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of Bitpanda, offered his views on this situation. When asked what fueled the latest gains, he replied simply that “It’s a combination of factors.” “The election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States was a key event, both because the uncertainty of the election is now over and because of the promises he made to the crypto industry during his campaign,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad emphasized via email. “Added to that, we have seen record ETF inflows, significant capital entering the crypto space from capital markets, falling interest rates, and a surge in interest from retail investors,” he noted. “The fact that a new all-time high was reached over the weekend suggests that the current price increase is driven mainly by heightened demand from retail investors rather than institutional ones. If this demand persists, we could see further price increases for some time,” the executive stated. Going forward, the analysts polled for this article offered optimistic price forecasts. Wendy O, in particular, seemed confident that bitcoin would reach a six-figure valuation before the year is through. “Personally it seems very likely Bitcoin could see $100,000 prior to 2025 as BlackRock IBIT is creating insane demand for the finite asset Bitcoin, with only 21 million ever made, $85,000 Bitcoin may just be the beginning,” she stated earlier in the day.

The San Francisco-based company’s shares (COIN: NASDAQ) closed Monday’s trading session at $334.24, Google Finance data shows. That’s a nearly 20% rise in the past 24 hours and close to an 84% jump over the past month. After-hours trading shows the stock is up a further 1% to $327.40. The digital asset giant isn’t far off touching its debut price of $381 when the company went public during the prior bull run, set roughly three years ago. Analysts are now forecasting a high price target for the stock of around $380 over a 12-month horizon—with nine experts recommending to buy and eight advising to hold, according to TipRanks data. Coinbase not only allows users to buy and sell major coins and tokens, but the company, which went public in 2021, also provides custody and other services to nearly all the spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, including Wall Street heavyweight BlackRock. Since crypto-friendly Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week, the stock has jumped 67%. President-elect Donald Trump became a cheerleader for Bitcoin and the digital asset industry during his campaign for the White House. He has vowed to allow all future Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. and for the country to become the “crypto capital of the planet.” His rhetoric prompted a “Trump trade,” with investors scooping up tech stocks and crypto before and after the election. Coinbase stock isn’t the only Bitcoin proxy to be up big: software company and now “Bitcoin development” firm MicroStrategy’s shares hit an all-time high of $351 today. The company is the largest publicly traded holder of the asset.

Title: Bitcoin BTC’s Price Surge to New All-Time High: Will the Bullish Trend Continue?

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Bitcoin recently surged to a new all-time high, fueling excitement across the crypto market. After breaking the strong resistance around $73,600 on November 6, Bitcoin has been gracefully soaring to new heights, clinching an all-time high of $76,228. Surprisingly, Bitcoin’s price broke this ATH yesterday, surging to over $82,000 and reaching 82,657 today, November 11. As the broader market reels in bullish sentiment, altcoins soar to new highs, with analysts predicting a possible Bitcoin surge to $100,000 before the year ends. Technical indicators point to further gains, suggesting that Bitcoin’s bullish trend could last in the coming days. But the big question is: Will the current momentum be sustained? This analysis will explore Bitcoin’s next possible moves as market momentum builds. Bitcoin has recently crossed above its Bollinger Band, signaling a strong bullish trend. Breaking above the upper Bollinger Band typically indicates increased buying pressure and potential for a continued upward movement. If Bitcoin manages to sustain this level, it could establish a strong support zone around the upper band, helping to maintain its current momentum. Additionally, Bitcoin remains above its bullish trendline, reinforcing the positive trend we’ve seen recently. Key support zones around the trendline have consistently pushed Bitcoin’s price higher. Also, the MACD is above the signal line with green histogram bars, signaling intense buying pressure. The above chart shows that Bitcoin BTC’s price recently broke out of its “fallen wedge” channel. This breakout is significant because the falling wedge pattern indicates that selling pressure is weakening. To confirm the bullish momentum, BTC retested the wedge’s upper boundary. When combined with other indicators, the current rally looks strong. So, there’s a strong possibility that Bitcoin’s bullish trend will extend further. MicroStrategy has just acquired 27,200 Bitcoin for $2 billion, co-founder Michael Saylor announced today, November 11. This purchase increases the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 279,420 BTC, valued at $11.9 billion. With Bitcoin hitting all-time highs, MicroStrategy’s investment is now seeing unrealized gains of over $10 billion. Saylor also revealed that the company achieved a 7.3% BTC yield quarter-to-date and 26.4% year-to-date. This massive purchase solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as one of the largest Bitcoin holders, ranking fifth after Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, and Grayscale. This purchase is a strong signal to the market, boosting overall confidence. When a major company like MicroStrategy increases its Bitcoin holdings, it attracts more buyers and investors. The timing of this acquisition, as Bitcoin is reaching new all-time highs, further strengthens the bullish market sentiment. Many investors may now view Bitcoin as an asset with long-term potential, especially seeing big players like MicroStrategy making significant moves. Veteran trader Peter Brandt predicts Bitcoin could surge to $250,000, highlighting a bullish breakout on the multi-year chart. He pointed to the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, often signaling strong upward momentum. Brandt compared Bitcoin’s current price action to spot Gold after a similar breakout, which saw significant gains. Though this forecast is for the long term, it has added to the growing bullish sentiment in the market. Such predictions often attract more buyers, driving prices higher as confidence in Bitcoin grows. The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with new projects, and one gaining significant attention is FreeDum Fighters (DUM). While Bitcoin’s potential rally is exciting, many investors are shifting focus to FreeDum Fighters ($DUM). Some believe $DUM could yield significant returns when it goes live. For those who may have missed Bitcoin’s early days, this could be the perfect time to explore emerging alternatives. This political-themed token quickly becomes a favorite in the emerging “PolitiFi” space. So far, it has raised over $468,000 in presale funding, reflecting growing investor interest ahead of the U.S. election. FreeDum Fighters offers a unique approach by blending cryptocurrency with politics. The token is part of the growing PolitiFi sector, which includes tokens tied to political themes and events. The total market cap of PolitiFi tokens has now reached $670 million, and investor interest is on the rise. FreeDum Fighters has built a solid community of 1,800 Twitter followers and 1,500 Telegram members, showing strong support for its project. The token is priced at $0.000075 in its presale phase, mirroring a democratic election process. Of the total supply, 40% is reserved for presale, while 20% will be used for exchange liquidity. Security has been a top priority for the team, as the token has already passed two independent audits. Also, FreeDum Fighters has an exciting roadmap that includes staking pools and weekly debates with rewards through airdrops. This ensures ongoing community engagement, making the project one to watch as the PolitiFi sector grows. With its strong presale and unique concept, FreeDum Fighters is a potential alternative to more established meme tokens.

Title: Kerry Group agrees fresh dairy joint venture with Kerry Co-op
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/11/kerry-group-agrees-fresh-dairy-joint-venture-with-kerry-co-op/
Time Published: 2024-11-11T20:42:10Z
Full Content:
Kerry Group and its main shareholder, Kerry Co-op, have reached a fresh agreement on a joint venture for the publicly-quoted food giant’s dairy division, according to sources. The deal, set to be unveiled on Tuesday morning, would see the co-op initially take a 70 per cent stake in the venture for about €350 million, putting a €500 million valuation on the business, they said. Kerry co-op is expected to ultimately buy the remainder of the dairy business, called Dairy Ireland, covering milk processing plants in the Republic and the UK, within five years for €150 million. The unit owns brands such as Charleville cheese and Cheestrings snacks. The outline of the accord, which follows the collapse in early 2021 of an original joint venture, was first reported on Monday evening by the Farmers Journal and Agriland publications. Spokesmen for Kerry Group and Kerry Co-op declined to comment when contacted by The Irish Times. Talks between both sides broke down in April 2021 after 18 months of negotiations, after Kerry Group rejected the co-op’s initial bid for a 60 per cent stake in the dairy processing business that would have valued the entire business at €600 million. Kerry Group was said to have placed a valuation expectation on the dairy unit of about €800 million at the time. Kerry co-op owns about 11.3 per cent of the listed company, more than double the 5.1 per cent interest held by the second-largest shareholder, US investment giant Blackrock. Kerry Group, which floated on the stock market in 1986 and is currently led by chief executive Edmond Scanlon, has long left its dairy co-op roots behind to become a global taste and nutrition giant. The taste and nutrition division accounted for 86 per cent of the group’s €8 billion of revenues last year and 96 per cent of its €1.2 billion earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). The development comes three years after Kerry Group sold its UK and Irish consumer foods’ meats and meals business – including brands such as Denny, Galtee and Richmond – to US poultry producer Pilgrim’s Pride for €819 million. The board of the co-op drafted in a veteran of the industry – former Dairygold boss Jim Woulfe – early last year to advise on a strategic review, which ultimately led to a return of both sides to the negotiating table. The latest deal will need the approval of shareholders of both companies. It follows Glanbia initially selling a 60 per cent in its Dairy Ireland segment to Glanbia Co-op in 2017, with the remaining 40 per cent being transferred five years later. Kerry Group reported on October 2rth that its volumes rose in the third quarter as the company remained on track to meet guidance for the year. However, the group noted consumer demand across many food and beverage markets remained relatively muted, a consequence of the inflation experienced in many of its markets. The Dublin-listed group said overall volumes were up 4.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year, with its more significant taste and nutrition unit growing 3.4 per cent. Growth was driven by the Americas, a good performance in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions, with more positive volumes in Europe in the third quarter. The Dairy Ireland business, which had been hit by falling prices in the first six months of the year, saw volume growth of 0.4 per cent in the year to date, with the third quarter recording a 5.7 per cent increase. Pricing was lower over the year to date, down 3.1 per cent, but the third quarter was more positive.

Title: Bitcoin: Trump win hurls crypto coin above $80,000 — Will the rally endure?

Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged without restraint. The President-elect intentionally courted the bitcoin community. But can he make good on his promises? The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was trading near $90,000 (€85,780) on Tuesday, reaching a new high. The record rally began on November 4 after Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the next US president. Jonas Groß, chairman of the Digital Euro Association — an organization that promotes digital payment systems — says Trump has declared himself to be the "crypto president" who will "lead the US to a pioneering role in bitcoin." Such promises have been made so far only by presidents of smaller countries, like [President Nayib Bukele of] El Salvador, Groß told DW. "It's no surprise that the crypto community is celebrating." Though Trump had previously harbored a negative opinion about the cryptocurrency, he suddenly made a U-turn during the 2024 election campaign. At a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, for example, he promised to keep the crypto market largely unregulated and to make energy cheaper for the power-hungry mining of cryptocurrencies. Generating new bitcoins and maintaining the so-called blockchain network on which all transactions are recorded requires significant energy. Co-Pierre Georg, director of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, attributes bitcoin's price surge primarily to "structural factors amplified by the US election." Georg told DW that the approval by US market regulators in January of so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in bitcoin made investing in the coin and other cryptocurrencies much easier. With ETFs, investors can profit from price movements by buying shares without owning bitcoin directly. Georg noted that since regulatory approval, huge amounts of money have flowed into such ETFs, indicating that mainly institutional investors, like the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, are fueling the rally. He said that direct purchases of bitcoin via crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpanda, or Kraken haven't fundamentally changed so much recently. Jonas Groß believes, however, that bitcoin's new all-time high mainly reflects sentiment and trust, similar to other publicly traded assets. While financial fraud dominated the headlines regarding bitcoin in the past, "it just needed a reason to lift spirits and get the machinery running again." Trump's soft regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies has "brought positive sentiment back," he added. Bitcoin's most prominent foe in the US administration is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, a staunch advocate of sweeping cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, Co-Pierre Georg expects Trump to try to reorganize the agency overseeing US financial markets but said the incoming president can't simply replace Gensler without proving specific errors. Georg also sees Trump's win as a victory for the crypto industry lobby. "At the moment, it appears that the industry has bought influence over the government and the new Congress," he said in a reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest man has proven an ardent fan of both cryptocurrencies and Donald Trump, whose campaign he supported with millions of dollars. According to news agency Reuters, the crypto industry spent nearly $120 million on support for Trump and Republican candidates, with a significant portion of the funding dedicated to unseat Senate Banking Committee chairman and crypto critic Sherrod Brown from the Democrats. The campaign of Brown's Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, was reportedly supported with industry donations of about $40 million. While in the past, bitcoin broke records mainly in the wake of major companies accepting it as payment, such as PayPal in 2020, Georg sees "no such reasons" at the moment. "Bitcoin is completely unsuitable for payments, and it's also not reliable as a stable investment. The only real reason to buy bitcoin is speculative." Jonas Groß is less skeptical, seeing some market fundamentals currently favoring the asset. "Bitcoin has established itself as a new asset class. The first pension funds are already investing, and in my view, it's only a matter of time before the first sovereign wealth funds enter the space. And then we're talking about an entirely different scale," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Noting that markets have already "priced in Trump's promises," he warned, however: "If it turns out he doesn't deliver, prices could of course fall again." For Co-Pierre Georg, predicting if the rally will continue under Trump is "like reading tea leaves." With bitcoin, he said, "you should only invest what you're prepared to lose completely." Moreover, he's wondering about the crypto industry and what it says that it "so strongly supports the election of a convicted criminal and political firebrand like Donald Trump, and then massively profits from his win." This article was originally written in German. Editor's note: This article, originally published on November 11, has been updated to reflect bitcoin's continued rally.

Title: Donald Trump Picks Stephen Miller for Deputy Chief of Staff
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/11/11/donald-trump-picks-stephen-miller-deputy-chief-staff/
Time Published: 2024-11-11T19:00:32Z

President Donald Trump has chosen immigration expert Stephen Miller as his deputy chief of staff, a source close to the president-elect confirmed to Breitbart News. The choice puts Trump’s promise of pro-American immigration reform at the center of his presidency and may help return the nation to a low-migration. high-tech future. Evidence Emerges Trump Is About to Unleash an Economic Boom; Guest John Carney The claim was first posted by CNN on Monday morning. “President-elect Donald Trump is expected to announce in the coming days that Stephen Miller, his top immigration adviser, will serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.” If appointed, Miller would work as deputy to Trump’s influential and experienced chief of Staff, Susan Wiles. The appointment would also help repatriation champion Tom Homan in his new job of enforcing Trump’s border and deportation policies on what may be sometimes reluctant agency officials. The appointment is also a signal that Trump’s appointee to run the Department of Homeland Security will face very strong pressure to vigorously enforce Trump’s immigration reform agenda. Trump’s team did not confirm the news report, CNN acknowledged, quoting his spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt: “President-elect Trump will begin making decisions on who will serve in his second administration soon. Those decisions will be announced when they are made.” Miller led Trump’s effort to curb illegal migration during the first term. But his push within the White House bureaucracy was repeatedly countered by establishment and media supporters of large-scale economic migration. In a second Trump administration, Miller will have to manage contradictory pressures on migration. For example, many of Trump’s business and GOP allies want more migration. But the 2024 voters gave him a mandate to reduce the migration that cuts Americans’ wages, drives up housing costs, and reduces investment in productivity-boosting technology. He will also have to balance demands from investors and Fortune 500 business groups who want more white-collar migration via airports, especially amid Trump-promised reductions in blue-collar migration via the southern border. The job would require Miller to oversee policy at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and even the Department of Education. Miller would get little sympathy from pro-migration reporters in the establishment media, most of whom prefer to portray him as a personal enemy of poor migrants. Few media outlets recognize the far-reaching consequences of migration on the nation’s economy. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink continued [emphasis added]: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology… “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2024 Breitbart

Data from CoinShares shows that investors were hungry for crypto products last week—and threw nearly $2 billion at investment funds giving exposure to digital assets. Most of this money was focused on the Bitcoin ETFs that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in January. The funds—run by asset managers such as Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale—allow investors to buy shares that track the price of the biggest virtual coin and trade on stock exchanges. “A combination of a supportive macro environment and seismic shifts in the U.S. political system being the likely reason for such supportive investor sentiment,” a Monday report by CoinShares reads, referring to Trump’s election win last week. It added that across all the funds it tracks—including across Europe and Asia, which give exposure to other major coins and tokens—the total amount of assets under management (AUM) hit a new all-time high mark of $116 billion. Investors also wanted to put money into Ethereum, the second biggest digital coin, the report noted: they pumped $157 million into funds around the world last week, with the new American Ethereum ETFs receiving their biggest inflows since they started trading in July. Bitcoin came close to touching $85,000 per coin Monday morning, according to CoinGecko data, setting a new all-time high price that’s more than $11,000 more than the previous mark broken on Election Day. It’s currently trading at $84,375—a seven-day rise of 23%. The asset has surged since Trump, a crypto supporter who’s promised to help the Bitcoin and digital asset industries, last week scored a shock victory in a tight race for the White House. Trump, who served as President from 2017-2021 and will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025, was not just a favorite for the crypto industry but also for Wall Street, with top hedge fund managers betting on his election ahead of last week’s result.

These next four years are going to be optimal for crypto holders. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. After months of sitting in consolidation, Bitcoin has broken its record high for the second time this year, rising to over $84,000 at the time of writing. CNBC reports the main driving force behind Bitcoin's resurgence is Donald Trump's electoral win for the presidential seat. Bitcoin broke its previous high ($73,794) on November 6, the day Trump won the election. Since then, Bitcoin has been on a nonstop bull run, charging to its all-time high of nearly $85,000 today. Bitcoin's new high represents a 15% increase over its previous high of $73,000 and a 23% increase from its last major high of $69,000 in 2021. This massive spike is purportedly a result of market euphoria following Trump's presidential win. Trump is a big supporter of cryptocurrency, promising to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. He also purportedly insists that all Bitcoin should be mined in the country. Trump's endorsement of crypto, especially Bitcoin, is encouraging investors to pour more money into the cryptocurrency. Purportedly, net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the two days after the election were combined over $2 billion. ETFs appear to be the leading value-builder for the world's most popular cryptocurrencies. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now more valuable than gold due to the election, making Bitcoin one of the most attractive asset builders moving forward. The good news for PC gamers and graphics card buyers is that Bitcoin's mining difficulty has not gotten any easier. As a result, we shouldn't see another major GPU mining shortage in the foreseeable future. Bitcoin's difficulty now requires dedicated ASICs to be profitable. Ethereum is in the same boat since the crypto moved to a proof-of-stake strategy that makes mining Ethereum with GPUs impossible. Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency that has seen price increases; virtually all of the popular cryptos have seen sudden spikes due to Trump's electoral win. Ethereum is now at $3,300, representing a full $1,000 increase in less than a week. Another popular coin, Ada (Cardano), has increased in value by over 80% in the same timeframe.

Title: The Climate Finance Racket

Advertisement More from the Review Subscribe to our Newsletter Best of The New York Review, plus books, events, and other items of interest November 21, 2024 Current Issue Current Issue More from the Review November 11, 2024 AFP/Getty Images Workers at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, Dubai, 2017 In 2023 the Gulf states supplied around 30 percent of the world’s crude oil imports. They all own sizable National Oil Companies (NOCs); Saudi Aramco is the world’s largest oil firm. And it is not just a matter of oil: they are also ramping up natural gas production. Only the United States exports more liquefied natural gas than Qatar. When it comes to addressing the climate crisis, the Gulf NOCs are fully aligned with the Western giants. They pledge to reduce emissions—by investing in renewables and technologies like carbon capture—while expanding oil and gas production.1 But the Gulf firms have a significant advantage. Where ExxonMobil lobbies governments to pass favorable legislation, the Gulf states directly shape global climate policy. Their influence is especially visible at UN climate talks, such as Conference of the Parties (COP). Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), presided over the last edition. As I noted in these pages, at COP28 Gulf NOCs like Saudi Aramco and ADNOC greenwashed their accelerating hydrocarbon extraction by pledging to also invest more in renewables. More of the same can be expected from COP29, which starts today in Baku, Azerbaijan. Like the UAE, Azerbaijan is wholly dependent on fossil fuels: oil and gas account for some 90 percent of its exports and up to half of its GDP. Mukhtar Babayev, who for more than two decades worked at Azerbaijan’s NOC, will be master of ceremonies. Elnur Soltanov, the deputy energy minister, is the event’s CEO. Last week the campaign group Global Witness, posing as fake oil and gas agents, met with him and filmed him agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at the event. If the focus in Dubai was on reaching an agreement to “transition away” from fossil fuels, Baku is being described as the “finance COP.” It is now clearer than ever that poorer countries can neither reduce their carbon emissions nor deal with the impacts of the climate crisis without monetary support. This is where “climate finance” comes in. The term refers to the various channels by which funds are raised for projects, mainly in the Global South, that address these issues. Those funds are needed for a range of activities: building green infrastructure, promoting conservation, investing in renewables, repairing damages, and so forth. They come from diverse sources: government development banks and aid agencies, multilateral organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and the private sector. Debates around climate finance tend to dwell on the gargantuan sums needed to shift our energy systems towards renewables. At the last COP, for instance, the conference’s conveners estimated that between five and seven trillion dollars will be needed annually “in greening the global economy by 2030.” Earlier this month the UN published a report noting that poorer countries were likely to received ten to eighteen times less funding than they need for climate adaptation. These are indeed alarming figures. A further complication is that funding inevitably comes with strings attached, most often in the form of loans at market rates that put their recipients deeper in debt.2 Governments, multilateral organizations, and private firms are all vying to shape climate finance markets—and their interests do not always align with the planet’s. These contradictions are likely to be laid bare in Baku, where Gulf states in particular are planning to pledge vast sums of money. * The Gulf states see no conflict between expanding hydrocarbon production and simultaneously investing in the green transition. If anything, they view the fight against climate change as a profit-making opportunity. Consider ACWA Power, a Saudi-owned energy firm that operates more than 280 subsidiaries across the world. On the one hand, ACWA is responsible for delivering 70 percent of Saudi Arabia’s planned renewable energy projects. (The country aims for half its energy to come from renewables by 2030.) It is currently building an enormous wind power plant in Azerbaijan that, when completed in 2025, will be that country’s largest renewable energy facility. It is also the official “energy and water partner” of COP29 and in this capacity will shape policy discussions. On the other hand, ACWA is still firmly anchored in oil and gas: in 2023 the company generated more than 90 percent of its electricity from plants fired by fossil fuels. The Gulf’s enthusiastic investment in climate finance is predicated on a similar understanding. Three of the world’s six biggest sovereign wealth funds (SWFs)—that is, state-owned investment funds—are headquartered in the Gulf; collectively they hold more than $3.5 trillion, much of which comes from oil and gas exports. The Gulf states are spending the money alongside their other petrodollar wealth to shape who provides climate finance and who receives it. In short, they are playing all sides of the energy market. This trend was on full display at COP28. During the early days of the conference, the UAE established a new private sector climate fund, Altérra, into which it poured $30 billion—more than a third of the total climate financing raised in Dubai. (The five multilateral climate funds established under the UN Climate Convention collectively raised little over $10 billion.) Altérra now bills itself as the “world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action” and has set a goal of mobilizing a further $250 billion by 2030. It aims to “bring unprecedented scale to address humanity’s most urgent challenge and supercharge the transition to a net-zero climate-resilient future.” Through a complex structure of nested ownership, it is largely controlled by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan—a member of the UAE’s ruling family, the country’s national security advisor, and the president’s brother. The firm is listed in Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone, the Abu Dhabi Global Market, where corporate and income tax are not levied. Advertisement As a private firm, Altérra aims to make above-average returns for its owners and investors. It operates not alone but as a “fund-of-funds,” partnering with asset management and private equity giants, notably BlackRock, Brookfield, and TPG Capital. By placing its capital in funds those firms manage, Altérra profits from their investments in infrastructure and other assets around the world. The portfolio is climate-agnostic—ie even includes fossil fuel stocks and plants in the Global North. Shortly after Altérra placed $650 million in BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Fund IV, it jointly purchased a fossil gas pipeline on the eastern seaboard. This is indeed a perverse kind of “climate change action.” Other Gulf governments and SWFs have invested billions of dollars in renewable and low-carbon technologies while remaining firmly grounded in hydrocarbons. Consider Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has over $900 billion in assets. The fund owns about 8 percent of Saudi Aramco and 44 percent of ACWA Power but it is branching into renewables and other green projects, recently allocating over $19 billion into sustainable investments. PIF is a founding member of the One Planet SWF Network, an initiative established after the Paris Agreement, which aims to channel sovereign wealth into green assets. (Three of the other five founding members are Gulf-based: SWFs in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, and Qatar.) Likewise, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi’s SWF, Mudabala, produces more than 350,000 barrels of oil a day across eleven countries, even as it finances solar and wind farms in India. Mubadala is also one of three shareholders of Masdar, the Al Jaber–chaired renewable energy firm that runs the world’s largest single-site solar power plant. * Another prominent form of climate finance is carbon offsetting: schemes in which governments, companies, or individuals fund projects that purportedly reduce carbon emissions. Such reductions are repackaged as financial assets known as carbon offsets (measured in tons of CO2), which are then sold to polluters, who use them to cancel out their own emissions. The carbon offset market is booming: Morgan Stanley predicts that, from about $2 billion in 2020, it will be worth $250 billion by 2050. There are various types of offset projects, but the most common one aims at preventing deforestation. This September, for instance, at New York’s Climate Week, the LEAF Coalition—comprising the governments of Norway, the UK, the US, and South Korea, as well as corporations from those countries—pledged funds to protect sections of the Amazon rainforest in Pará, Brazil (incidentally, the country hosting COP30). “The state government will use the proceeds from the LEAF agreement to finance its statewide programs to further reduce deforestation and support…sustainable economic development,” the press release reads. Carbon offsetting is beset with accusations of greenwashing, fraud, and human rights violations. For one thing, indigenous communities in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia—crucial targets of offsetting projects—have been evicted from their forest homelands in the name of preservation. In 2023 the journalists Daisy Dunne and Yanine Quiroz compiled research on over sixty carbon offset projects, finding that 70 percent caused harm to Indigenous people and local communities. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch documented how the Chong Indigenous people were expelled from their lands in southern Cambodia to make way for the Southern Cardamom REDD+ Project. Repeated evictions and displacement have led the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples, Francisco Calí Tzay, to call for a global moratorium on carbon offset projects. There are also two methodological flaws with carbon credit accounting. One is that any calculation of the emissions saved through projects like forest protection rests upon a shaky counterfactual: how much carbon would have been released if it was not in place? This is obviously impossible to determine with any certainty. A study in Science of offset projects across six countries found that most did not reduce deforestation, and that carbon credits sold were used to “offset almost three times more carbon emissions than their actual contribution to climate change mitigation.” Advertisement The second problem is temporal. When a buyer purchases carbon offsets, they gain the right to pollute in the present. But it takes hundreds of years for a forest to absorb an equivalent amount of carbon, and there is no guarantee that the forest will stand for that long. In California recent wildfires have consumed large forested areas that were ostensibly protected by offsets purchased by companies like Microsoft and BP. Unsurprisingly, the Gulf states are emerging as leading advocates of offsetting. This came to the fore at the African Climate Summit, convened in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2023. Here a group of prominent Emirati energy and financial firms, known as the UAE Carbon Alliance, committed to buying $450 million worth of carbon credits over the next six years from the African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), a coalition of African governments, carbon credit firms, Western donors, and multilateral organizations. The agreement made the UAE the largest financial backer of ACMI. Saudi Arabia is likewise deeply involved in carbon markets. The Saudi businesswoman Riham ElGizy heads the Regional Voluntary Carbon Market Company (RVCMC), which was set up in 2022 as a joint venture between PIF and the Saudi stock exchange, Tadawul. (Soltanov, the CEO of COP29, has lauded RVCMC for creating carbon offset markets “at speed and at scale with global impact.”) In 2022 and 2023 RVCMC organized the world’s two biggest carbon credit auctions, at which more than 3.5 million tons worth of carbon credits were sold, 70 percent of them sourced from African offset projects; the principal buyers were Saudi firms, led by Saudi Aramco. Indeed, offsetting is central to Saudi Aramco’s official “sustainability” plan, accounting for around a third of the 52 million metric tons of carbon it pledges to reduce by 2035. In addition to buying carbon offsets, Gulf companies are establishing the projects that generate them. Shortly before the COP28 summit, investigative journalists from SourceMaterial broke the story that Blue Carbon—a company owned by Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai’s ruling family—had signed deals with African governments to lease vast tracts of land, including 10 percent of Liberia, Zambia, and Tanzania, and an astonishing 20 percent of Zimbabwe. Blue Carbon, which has no experience in the industry, will either protect preexisting forests or plant trees in these areas, creating carbon credits to sell to polluters. Axel Michaelowa, a scientist at the University of Zurich, estimates that the carbon credits earned this way would be equivalent to all of the UAE’s annual carbon emissions. In this light, the upcoming negotiations in Baku take on an ominous significance. Member nations at COP29 are expected to agree on a set of international trading standards for carbon credits. This October the Article 6.4 Supervisory Board, the body responsible for developing governance mechanisms for the carbon market under the Paris Agreement, released their proposals, which regulate how carbon credits are established and calculated but accept the system’s basic principles. The Financial Times noted that the rules could allow “oil-producing nations to avoid their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels or make cuts in their industrial emissions.” One fact has not been widely reported: Saudi Arabia currently chairs the Board, represented by Maria AlJishi, who worked for a long time at Saudi Aramco. Climate finance is a programmatically market-led “solution” to the climate crisis in that it is predicated on further commodifying nature. By justifying extraction here by investing in so-called law carbon projects there, prolonging business as usual in the present while making vague promises about the future, it offers a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. To understand where such policies come from, it would be remiss to focus solely on Western oil companies. Major oil producing states in the Global South—like the Gulf monarchies, Azerbaijan, and Brazil—also profit from these projects and agreements, which are in the end disastrous for the planet and its inhabitants. As we watch these states help steer the direction of COP negotiations, we should remember that they are not voices for climate justice but part of the problem.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Internet Retail Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) stands against other best internet retail stocks to buy now. According to a report published by FTI Consulting, the United States e-commerce is experiencing a revival after a period of stagnation post-COVID. After 18 months of slow growth, e-commerce sales began to pick up again in early 2023 as consumers resumed shopping habits that had been altered during the pandemic. The report notes that e-commerce sales growth represented 46% of total retail sales growth in 2023 and surged to 57% in the first quarter of 2024, marking its highest contribution since 2017, excluding pandemic spikes. Consumers have adopted the trend of shopping online as despite the reopening of physical stores, many consumers continue to prefer online shopping. The report indicates that foot traffic in stores remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, with many Americans choosing to shop online rather than visit physical locations. This shift suggests a long-term change in consumer behavior, as evidenced by ongoing declines in in-store visits and increased e-commerce market share. Talking about the pandemic era from 2020 to 2022 total retail sales in the United States (excluding auto and gas) increased by 31%, compared to only 12.2% from 2017 to 2019. The report suggests this translates to an additional $1.9 trillion in retail spending above pre-COVID norms. This increased spending benefited the e-commerce segment as it was able to capture 87% of the increase in total retail spending during the height of the pandemic lockdowns. Looking forward, the United States’ e-commerce sales are projected to grow at a sustainable rate of high to mid-single digits annually. This is a significant slowdown from the mid-teens growth rates seen before COVID but still sufficient for continued market share gains against traditional retail channels. Moreover, the report also highlighted that newcomers including Temu, Shein, and TikTok Shop are entering the US e-commerce market. These newcomers are disrupting the established players through a strategy of becoming low-cost retailers. For instance, Temu achieved $14 billion in global gross merchandise value (GMV) sales in 2023 and is targeting $30 billion for 2024. On the other hand, Shein captured 40% of the fast fashion market domestically and had an estimated global GMV of $42 billion in 2023. Moreover, TikTok Shop was launched in 2023 and is aiming for $50 billion in global e-commerce sales by 2024. The report suggests that while these platforms may attract budget-conscious consumers, they may not significantly threaten established e-commerce giant’s dominance due to perceived differences in product quality and brand positioning. Looking ahead as per FTI Consulting the US online retail sales are expected to hit $1.2 trillion in 2024 translating to a 9.8% increase year-over-year. Moreover, the e-commerce market share is also expected to increase from 21.6% in 2023 to 22.7% by the end of the current year. Moreover, some of the key trends identified by the reports are a sharp increase in the closing of physical retail stores due to increased labor costs, rents, and the feasibility of selling online. In addition to this, another key trend is the use of artificial intelligence among internet retailers, which helps engage with customers more closely and enables a personalized shopping experience. We have also covered the 7 Best E-commerce Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. Here’s an excerpt from the article: “E-commerce is growing faster than expected and as new avenues of selling online open up, companies are bound to keep up with trends and innovative strategies. According to a report by Forbes, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $7.9 trillion by 2027 from $6.3 trillion in 2024. In 2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to be made online, up from 20.1% in 2024. To compile the list of 10 best internet retail stocks to buy now we used the Finviz stock screener.

(Bloomberg) -- The world’s biggest asset manager is leaning into the stock market’s post-election rally after shying away from risk exposure in the run-up to the vote. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration More than $1.9 billion flooded into the $13 billion iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (ticker MTUM) on Friday, the biggest one-day flow since the fund’s 2013 launch, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At the same time, a record $1 billion exited from the $32.5 billion iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (IUSB). A BlackRock spokesperson confirmed that the firm adjusted its model portfolio allocations last week. The influx of funds into MTUM reflects BlackRock’s conviction that US equities — fresh off their best weekly performance of 2024 — will continue to climb as a “coiled spring” of pent-up business activity unwinds. With election uncertainty resolved, decisions on corporate capital allocations that were formerly on hold will resume. As such, the firm’s model portfolio team, which oversees about $131 billion in assets, is increasing its overweight on stocks from 3% to 4% heading into year-end. “Rather than attempting to thread the needle with tactical sector or industry bets tied to specific electoral outcomes, we’re positioning for a broader relief rally that we believe will transcend partisan results,” Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite wrote in investment commentary dated Nov. 8. “This ‘uncertainty discount’ embedded in market prices should begin to thaw as businesses and investors regain their footing and seek to execute on delayed strategic initiatives.” Model portfolios — which package together funds into ready-made strategies to sell to advisers — have ballooned in size in recent years. Broadridge Financial Solutions estimates that model assets likely reached $5.1 trillion at the end of 2023, and could reach $11 trillion by 2028. As a result, even small adjustments can cause big shifts in ETF flows. In addition to post-vote clarity, Gates wrote that recent economic data — showing that the labor market is cooling while growth remains resilient — should support the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting campaign, adding to the firm’s bullish conviction.

Title: Bitcoin soars past $82,000 as the Trump rally shows no sign of slowing

Bitcoin keeps hitting new record highs as the cryptocurrency rallies on Donald Trump’s presidential election win, which will put a crypto ally in the White House for the first time ever. The leading cryptocurrency surged to $89,560 on Monday evening, just hours after reaching $82,000 earlier that day, extending its impressive 126% gain for the year. According to the crypto tracking website CoinGecko, Bitcoin has surged more than 129,296% since 2013, meaning that a $1000 investment in Bitcoin back then would now be worth over $1.2 million. And its price is expected to continue barreling forward, as investors’ optimism and enthusiasm grows on Trump’s return to the Oval Office in January. Some analysts say Bitcoin could even cross the $100,000 threshold as a result. Throughout his campaign, Trump took an unprecedented pro-Bitcoin stance, championing the digital currency as a symbol of financial independence and an alternative to traditional banking. Labeling himself as the “crypto candidate,” Trump fully embraced digital assets in his campaign, even accepting donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana. Trump also addressed a Bitcoin event, attending the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, where he emphasized his commitment to positioning America at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Following Trump’s election win last week, investors began pouring cash into spot Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. On Thursday alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK-0.52%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with more than $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs have lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across a number of other digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was priced at more than $3,100 as of Monday morning. Dogecoin surged 18% in the past 24 hours, while Solana was up 6%. The global crypto market is valued at $2.79 trillion — an almost 3% rise in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap.

It will also test the nation’s appetite for IPOs that can scale past the $1 billion mark. For its IPO, Swiggy has already secured $1.4 billion from institutional investors, including Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, BlackRock and eight of the top 10 Indian mutual funds. Still, it will enter a public market where large tech companies’ stocks have struggled historically. Three years since its $2.5 billion offering, Paytm is still trading 47% below its IPO price. More than a dozen Indian tech startups have gone public in the last four years, but the market has shown scant interest in large IPOs. Beauty and wellness e-commerce company Nykaa is still trading 53% below its debut price, and Star Health and Allied Insurance Company remains 48% below its IPO price three years on. Startups that raised less than $500 million in India have performed incredibly well in comparison. India has emerged as a hotbed for tech IPOs this year even as the U.S. market remains muted. All eyes are on Swiggy’s IPO at the moment, particularly as many growth-stage startups — and their investors — are eyeing a similarly large listing over the next 24 months. Furthermore, for many Indian startups that were based in the U.S. and Singapore, moving their official HQs back to India would let them better comply with local regulations to do such an IPO. It’s also an opportunity to reap the benefits of a market whose benchmark index had risen more than 10% in the past year. Up to three dozen startups could be shifting their domiciles back to India in the coming years, according to investors. The prospects for Swiggy’s IPO looks good — especially given that rival Zomato’s stock has surged over 100% since its $1.3 billion listing in 2021, reaching a market cap high of $29 billion this year. In comparison, Swiggy is seeking a valuation of $11.3 billion. It helps that the Indian food delivery market has long been a duopoly between Zomato and Swiggy. And what makes the offer even more attractive to investors is that Swiggy is among the dozen firms attempting to disrupt the $1.1 trillion Indian retail market that is still dominated by millions of mom-and-pop stores. Swiggy’s Instamart is among the top three quick-commerce businesses in the country, which promises deliveries of groceries, wellness, and beauty products and much more within 10 minutes. Whether these companies will be able to revolutionize the broader retail market in India remains to be seen, but they have already captured 56% of the online grocery delivery market from e-commerce firms, according to JPMorgan. Quick-commerce firms such as Instamart, Zomato-owned Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, and Minutes are changing consumer behavior in urban Indian cities, home to about 80 million people. Together, they are on track to record sales of more than $6 billion this year, according to TechCrunch estimates. “I don’t think Swiggy will just be an e-commerce company in the future, but I do think that given the growth rate of Instamart, and the total addressable market it’s going after, the percentage of e-commerce in Swiggy is going to have a dramatic change,” said Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety (pictured above at the top) in an interview with TechCrunch. Underpinning this business model is a unique supply chain system that involves strategically setting up hundreds of discrete warehouses, or “dark stores,” within kilometers of residential and business areas. This allows the firms to make deliveries within minutes of an order. This approach differs from that of e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, which have fewer but much larger warehouses in areas where rent is cheaper and farther from residential areas. Swiggy operates over 600 such facilities, while Zomato’s Blinkit ended the September quarter with 791 stores. Swiggy, which counts Prosus, SoftBank, Accel, and Elevation among its backers, has scaled Instamart to 30 Indian cities. But many investors and analysts have expressed doubts about the viability of extending the quick-commerce model to smaller Indian cities and towns. “Do we have an operating model for city number 500? Honestly, I don’t know,” said Majety. Asked if the model works on city number 75, Majety said: “I think that probably exists. We will see city 75 having quick commerce.” Swiggy’s IPO will also show how willing investors are to bet on business models that prioritize growth over profits amid challenging global conditions. For Dutch investor Prosus, Swiggy’s listing could deliver a threefold return. It will also be the venture firm’s biggest hit from India, where its $1 billion-plus gains from Byju’s have all but evaporated. Accel is expected to see a more than 35-fold return, one of its largest in the past five years. Topics What’s DOGE?
