Title: Report: Unelected Canada PM Mark Carney Declared 'Strong Confidence' in Investing in China on Beijing Trip

Full Content:
Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who was installed after an internal Liberal Party election in March, “expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China” during a visit to Beijing in October, Canadian outlets recalled this week. The Chinese government summary of his visit to Beijing while serving as an economic adviser to pro-China leftist predecessor Justin Trudeau followed multiple revelations suggesting Carney’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and its ideology is dangerous close, including his refusal to drop a Liberal Party candidate who called for citizens to capture anti-communist dissidents for a Chinese “bounty” and the securing of a sweetheart loan to his former company, Brookfield Asset Management. It is in his capacity as chairman of Brookfield that Carney visited Beijing and met with its mayor, Yin Yong, in October. Carney is currently in a cutthroat race to keep his appointed prime ministership in an election scheduled for April 28. His most formidable opponent, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, argued on Wednesday that Carney was “compromised by the authoritarian regime in Beijing” – a grave accusation following multiple reports that Canadian intelligence officials have uncovered Chinese regime operations to interfere in Canadian elections. The Canadian outlet Blacklock’s Reporter reported on Tuesday, citing the anti-communist Epoch Times, that Carney “lobbied” the mayor of Beijing during his visit in October. Both reports were based on an article in the Chinese state outlet Beijing Daily published on October 23, 3024, on Yin’s meetings with Carney and the vice chairman of BlackRock, Philipp Hildebrand. The two men were in Beijing to attend the “Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum.” “Yin encouraged Brookfield Asset Management and BlackRock to seize opportunities, tap into their strengths, and increase their investment and business presence in Beijing,” Beijing Daily reported. “He invited both companies to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and share the dividends of Beijing’s high-quality development and high-standard opening-up.” “Both foreign guests expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China,” the report continued. Carney, it claimed, personally “highlighted Brookfield Asset Management’s keen interest in seizing development opportunities in China, further expanding its business in Beijing, and deepening cooperation with relevant partners in areas such as green finance, fund management, and infrastructure investment.” A month after Carney’s visit to Beijing, in November, Brookfield secured a a $276 million 15-year loan with four percent interest, a greatly beneficial deal to the asset manager that Conservatives described as a “sweetheart” agreement. Carney’s visit to China and the massive Brookfield loan occurred after Carney became an official part of the Trudeau government. As the National Post recalled this week, Trudeau offered Carney a job as the leader of a Liberal Party “task force on economic growth.” Carney had previously advised Trudeau on his disastrous response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and on green energy. Poilievre condemned Carney’s relationship with China on Wednesday, describing him as “compromised.” “His company owes the Chinese state-owned bank a quarter billion dollars. He protected a Liberal candidate & MP who said a Canadian citizen should be turned over to Beijing for a bounty,” Poilievre noted. “And now we find out he lobbied the Chinese government weeks before becoming PM to ‘deepen co-operation.’ The Carney Liberals can’t be trusted to keep Canadians safe. They don’t deserve a fourth term.” The “bounty” comment concerned the scandal emerging this week surrounding member of Parliament and now-former Liberal Party candidate Paul Chiang. In January, Chiang had suggested to Chinese-language media that individuals should attempt to abduct his opponent, anti-communist activist Joe Tay, to receive a bounty from the Chinese government. “If anyone here can take [Tay] to the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto, you can get the million-dollar reward,” Chiang said. When the comments emerged in Anglophone media in late March, Carney mildly condemned them but refused to call for Chiang to step down, calling the scandal a “teachable moment.” “He’s made his apology. He’s made it to the public, he’s made it to the individual concerned, he’s made it directly to me, and he’s going to continue with his candidacy,” Carney said. “He has my confidence.” Chiang stepped down anyway on March 31. Brookfield Asset Management is an international company that first invested in China in 2013. According to the website of its Chinese office, it has invested heavily in green energy in China as well as the country’s floundering real estate market. “We have continued to invest in assets that form the backbone of China’s economy across critical industries including logistics, retail, energy and business services,” Brookfield said of itself. Bloomberg News highlighted Brookfield as a company bucking the trend of Western investors fleeing the decaying post-lockdown Chinese economy in May. “There are many global investors that are not interested in China anymore, but there a lot that are,” Brookfield Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt said at a panel in Qatar that month, as quoted by Bloomberg. “The local investors have money in China and are doubling down on investing in China.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Title: Trump Delays TikTok Ban Again, Saying Deal ‘Requires More Work’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-tiktok-delays-ban-us-deal-1236355158/
Time Published: 2025-04-04T17:46:24Z
Full Content:
By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump said he’s going to delay enforcement of a U.S. law that requires TikTok‘s parent company to sell to non-Chinese owners for another 75 days — setting a new deadline of mid-June. In a post Friday on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.” TikTok had faced a looming April 5 deadline set by Trump to reach a deal that would comply with the U.S. law — or effectively be banned from being hosted or distributed in the country. The app has been painted as a national security threat to the U.S. by many American lawmakers because of its ownership by China’s ByteDance. Related Stories VIP+ With Anime Market Projected to Triple, Netflix and Crunchyroll Poised to Dominate It Together Super Bowl: Tubi Attracted One-Third of Streaming Viewership for 2025's Big Game, Per Nielsen ByteDance said Friday that it has been in discussions with U.S. government officials “regarding a potential solution for TikTok U.S.” and that “an agreement has not been executed.” Popular on Variety “There are key matters to be resolved,” ByteDance said. “Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.” Trump’s second punt on the TikTok ban comes a day after VP JD Vance said in an interview on Fox News that the administration would announce a deal by Saturday that would keep the app legal. It also came as financial markets entered their second day of significant declines in response to Trump’s plan to enact steep tariffs on most countries, including China. A deal led by the Trump administration to spin off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company — majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law — had been “largely finalized” Wednesday, including approval from ByteDance, Reuters reported. But the Chinese government refused to sign off on the plan because of Trump’s new tariffs, according to the report. Trump technically does not have authority under the TikTok-targeted legislation, passed in 2024 with bipartisan congressional support and signed by President Biden, to postpone the enforcement of the law. But he continues acting as if he does have the power to forestall an effective nationwide U.S. ban on the popular app while the White House tries to figure out a new American-controlled ownership structure for TikTok. Trump on Friday said negotiations were in progress with China, which has the authority to block any sale of TikTok by ByteDance. The U.S. government’s TikTok divest-or-ban law bars the app from operating in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance — while the Chinese government has opposed a TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. A 75-day extension from Friday would make the new deadline June 18. Trump said on Truth Social, “We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to ‘go dark.’ We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle and Blackrock, which have been reported to be in deal talks. Oracle is seen as logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. Others that have expressed interest in bidding for TikTok include Amazon, former L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and Tim Stokely, the founder of OnlyFans. Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. In January, TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds. It briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18 but came back online citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why Tariffs Make Now A Strategic Time To Buy Bitcoin

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. President Donald Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariffs (Photo by Chip ... More Somodevilla/Getty Images) On April 3, 2025, Wall Street faced its steepest decline since the COVID pandemic, almost exactly five years ago. Following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, which revealed a sweeping set of new tariffs, the market swiftly responded negatively. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4%, and the Nasdaq tumbled 6%. This move ignited fears of a prolonged trade war, fueling concerns about rising inflation and a potential recession. Even gold, which has long been considered a safe haven, tumbled after the announcement. Small-cap stocks suffered the most, with the Russell 2000 down 6.6%. Amid this historic market selloff, one asset stood out for its relative stability: Bitcoin. Though the leading cryptocurrency initially fell 5%, it quickly rebounded and held at around $81K, climbing the following day to over $83K. While almost every other asset class faced steep losses, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support levels underscored its growing role as a financial alternative in uncertain times. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s resilience is mounting skepticism over the long-term viability of the U.S. dollar. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently raised concerns in his “2025 Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors” that America’s rising debt could threaten its role as the world’s reserve currency. In the letter, Fink states that the U.S. national debt has grown three times the pace of GDP, and this year, interest payments on that debt will exceed $952 billion, more than the country’s defense budget. By 2030, mandatory federal spending and debt service are projected to consume all government revenue. “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink warned. His comments seem to reflect a growing view among investors who are looking for alternatives to traditional currencies and see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic instability. Even as equity markets plunged, Bitcoin remained above key support thresholds, suggesting sustained investor confidence. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the broader selloff that engulfed small-cap and tech stocks. Shares of crypto-exposed companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell 7% and 10%, respectively, but Bitcoin itself avoided deeper losses. Tuur Demeester, Bitcoin investor and economist, posted on X, “As the global economy starts to repair decades of resource misallocation, savers increasingly seek refuge in liquid, scarce safe haven assets. Stocks _will_ decouple from bitcoin.” The relatively stable performance suggests investors are viewing Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a durable store of value, despite intense market pressure. With over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply already in circulation and the final coins being released at an increasingly slower pace due to programmed halvings every four years, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly scarce asset. Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply cap, unlike government-issued currencies subject to inflationary pressures, positions Bitcoin as a strong hedge against currency debasement and a compelling long-term store of value. Author and financial advisor Morgen Rochard said, “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As markets reel from geopolitical shocks and fiscal uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly proving itself as more than a speculative asset. It’s becoming a reliable financial alternative. With its fixed supply, growing adoption, and resilience amid chaos, Bitcoin offers investors a way to avoid the volatility of centralized monetary systems. In a world where trust in traditional assets is wavering, owning Bitcoin may be less about chasing returns and more about securing financial sovereignty.

Title: Blockchain Meets Banking: BNY’s Bold Move With BlackRock In Tow

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. unveiled a new blockchain-based tool Friday that posts up-to-date net asset value (NAV) data for tokenized funds directly on a blockchain. According to company officials, BlackRock will be the first client to implement this technology with their on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. According to a report by Fortune, the financial giant’s move comes amid growing acceptance of blockchain technology in traditional finance, supported by favorable regulatory changes under US President Donald Trump’s administration. BNY Mellon temporarily paused its crypto custody services during the Biden Administration after the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance known as SAB 121, which created balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients. In 2024, the bank received an exemption allowing it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum for exchange-traded products without treating them as balance-sheet liabilities. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, which was widely unpopular among banks and crypto companies. BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL #BlackRock #BNY #BUIDL #Bitcoin https://t.co/HRHN1RdFM1 — Digital Startup (@digitalstartup5) April 3, 2025 BlackRock, which depends on BNY Mellon as both fund administrator and custodian for its BUIDL fund, will be the first to use the new tool. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, called BNY’s ability to bring off-chain data insights to public blockchains “an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry” in a statement shared with Fortune. The partnership builds on BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public statements supporting increased tokenization of financial assets to improve costs and efficiency. While the technology remains limited to specific test cases and mostly blockchain-native customers, this implementation represents a step toward broader adoption. Caroline Butler, BNY’s head of digital assets, explained in an interview with Fortune that the new product will allow more transparent and current information around tokenized funds. “Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she said. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.” The tool posts NAV information directly to the blockchain instead of relying on third-party accounting services. According to Butler, this helps investors see current NAV values of instruments like BUIDL, which can improve their creditworthiness. While this type of data sharing isn’t unique to crypto, Butler noted that BNY’s blockchain technology enables the company to offer a more complete set of tools for tokenized funds. BNY Mellon’s latest offering represents another step into the blockchain sector, which began in 2008 with Bitcoin’s introduction. Despite market ups and downs, the bank has shown ongoing interest in the technology, including a previous launch of a digital asset custody platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In March, Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on stablecoins. “Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she stated at the hearing.

Title: Markets tumble with S&P and Dow down for second day after China matches Trump tariffs

Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. WATCH: Markets plunge in wake of Trump’s new tariffs and fears of global trade war The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8 percent to pull more than 20 percent below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34 percent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34 percent tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4 percent from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7 percent after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12 percent of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16 percent. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5 percent, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8 percent. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01 percent from 4.06 percent late Thursday and from roughly 4.80 percent early this year. It had gone below 3.90 percent in the morning.

Title: Ralph Lauren in Bidding War With LVMH for SoHo Storefront

Time Published: 2025-04-04T15:01:08Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy A prominent SoHo corner spot at Prince and Greene streets has been at the center of a bidding war by two luxury brands, but it looks like the longtime occupant, Ralph Lauren, will pay up to keep the space, Commercial Observer has learned. While the ground-floor storefront 109 Prince Street has been occupied by the retailer since 2010, its lease is coming due. French retail giant LVMH has been battling for the space, which LVHM wants for Tiffany & Co., now located at nearby 97 Greene Street. Sources told CO Ralph Lauren will most likely purchase the spot, but it could also turn into a high-priced lease instead. Most retail deals are currently trading at a 6.5 to 8 percent cap rate, according to broker Adelaide Polsinelli of Compass, who marketed the space a decade ago for $54 million with no takers. While unaware of but not involved in the current transaction, she said Ralph Lauren would now command a premium over that range, putting it at a 5 to 5.5 percent cap rate. The Real Estate Board of New York‘s fall report found average retail asking rents along the Broadway corridor in SoHo to be $490 per square foot. Any new starting rent for Ralph Lauren would likely be higher. LVMH has been trying to find a new home for Tiffany for some time, but keeps losing out. Over the last year, the company has tried to lease the former Nespresso store at 92 Prince Street, which was instead leased to Ferrari, as well as the nearby Apple (AAPL) store at 103 Prince Street. That 30,000-square-foot former post office has been occupied by Apple since 2001 and underwent a $30 million expansion and renovation in 2011 when it was purchased by Imperium Capital. With the aggressive LVMH nipping at the bricks, to maintain its space, one real estate source said, “Apple was forced to renew at a rent they didn’t love.” Now it looks like LVMH has lost out on another Prince Street deal and pushed another retailer to pony up. The primary owner of 109 Prince is the Swiss investor and art financier Jean-Pierre Lehmann, who bought the 20,000-square-foot historic cast-iron building in 1991 for $3 million. He completely renovated the French Renaissance-style edifice, first home to silk dealers and later to chemical suppliers, designed by Jarvis Morgan Slade and now part of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. In 1997, Lehmann sponsored the building as a live-work artist condominium through his company Prince Street Realty, with retail on the ground floor, second floor and lower level, plus three upper-floor residences. In May 2010, records show Ralph Lauren signed a lease for the two retail lots, which had been a Replay store with a café in the lower level. The lease ends in 2026. The ground-floor lot has 3,258 square feet with a retail-friendly, 16-foot-high ceiling and a lower-level cellar spanning 3,386 square feet. The second-story retail condo has 3,265 square feet, and restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten leased it for storage. It could not be determined if he still leases that space. With those leases in hand, however, Lehman reconstituted the ownership entity of the two lots and obtained a mortgage of $18 million. After trying to sell the leased retail for $54 million through Polsinelli, enough interest was generated to up the mortgage in 2014 to $35 million with J.P. Morgan Chase, which pooled it into a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. In 2016, as Ralph Lauren was closing stores around the country, CO reported that loan could be at risk in 2026 if the retailer did not renew since the store occupied 74.2 percent of the space, with 25.8 percent being occupied by others — presumably Vongerichten. But now the loan appears to be paid off. A Securities and Exchange Commission report from February 2025 said the balance on the one New York retail loan was $29.6 million and had an interest rate of 4.65 percent. Scheduled to mature in January 2026, the loan was anticipated to be repaid in June 2024. While no loan satisfaction has been filed, the report also stated there was an “unscheduled principal” prepayment for a partial liquidation of $156,917, and that the loan was paid through March 1. The upper floors are all residential condominiums. The third floor of the building has been owned since December 1998 by a Fortress Investment Group executive who did not respond to requests for comment. He paid $1.375 million to late art gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend, who had paid $775,000 just a year earlier. She also paid $775,000 for the fourth floor, which she sold back to Lehmann’s entity in mid-1998 for $1.589 million. His entity also still owns the fifth floor that has exclusive use of the roof. Sources said Ralph Lauren is likely negotiating this deal in-house but its spokesperson did not return requests for comment. Lehmann’s attorney and an LVMH spokesperson also did not return requests for comment. Naturally, this deal may still be undone. If inked as a sale, however, it would continue what is now a long trend of retailers buying New York City real estate. Prominent sales to retailers include Prada buying 720 and 724 Fifth Avenue, and a space in 730 Fifth Avenue, from Jeff Sutton for $835 million; Kering paying Sutton $963 million for 100,000 square feet at the base of 717 Fifth Avenue, which it is expected to renovate for Gucci; and James Dyson‘s Weybourne Group picking up 155 Mercer Street for $60 million as well as 770 Madison Avenue from Sutton and the Reuben Brothers for $135 million, where it is expected they will eventually locate Dyson stores. Plus, as CO first reported, Chanel is now negotiating to buy 60,000 square feet of retail in the base of Gary Barnett’s upcoming 655 Madison Avenue luxury residential tower for around $450 million. Barnett has already sold 70,000 square feet at 570 Fifth Avenue to Ikea’s parent for about $400 million. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Sell-off worsens worldwide and Dow drops after China retaliates against Trump' tariffs

Stock markets worldwide are careening even lower Friday after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The S&P 500 was down 5% in morning trading, coming off its worst day since COVID wrecked the global economy in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,656 points, or 4.2%, as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.5% lower. So far there are few, if any winners, in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks saw some of the day’s biggest losses, with indexes sinking roughly 5%. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down roughly 16% from its record set in February. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying out some “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Otherwise, many say a recession looks likely. For his part, Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. Vietnam said its deputy prime minister would visit the U.S. for talks on trade, while the head of the European Commission has vowed to fight back. Others have said they were hoping to negotiate with the Trump administration for relief. Trump criticized China's retaliation on Friday, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 16.8% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 14.3% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 13.3%. United Airlines, which is in an alliance with Air China and got a third of its passenger revenue last year from flights across the Pacific, lost 12.6%. In the bond market, Treasury yields continued their sharp drop as worries rise about the strength of the U.S. economy, along with expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to cushion it. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 3.90% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. That’s a major move for the bond market. The Fed could cut its main interest rate to relax the pressure on the economy, as it was doing late last year before pausing in 2025. But it may have less freedom to move than it would like. Lower rates can goose the economy by making it easier for U.S. companies and households to borrow and spend. But they can also push upward on inflation. And worries are already worsening about that because of tariffs, with U.S. households in particular bracing for sharp increases to their bills. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.6% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%.

Title: Jasmine Crockett branded a hypocrite for taking $370k from PACs, business trips to Hamas-supporting Qatar: records

Full Content:
Liberal firebrand Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) took almost $400,000 from political action committees, despite claiming otherwise, documents seen by The Post reveal. A 2020 tweet sent by the 44-year-old congresswoman — recently blasted for referring to disabled Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, as “Hot Wheels” — claimed she had accepted “zero dollars” from corporate PACs while her opposition had taken $192,000. However, campaign finance disclosure data for the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, show a different picture. Disclosures from when she ran for state representative of District 100 in the Dallas area show 22 different entries from donors described as PACs, giving between $500 and $5,000 to her campaign. They include telecoms company AT&T, various teaching associations, a wholesale beer PAC, a Texas trial lawyers PAC and others. Prof. Matthew Foster, a lecturer on government at American University, told The Post: “What’s controversial about [PACs] is people fundamentally see it as an issue of buying one’s support. “Democrats are more sensitive to this. They know people look at their contributions and use them against them. Candidates and campaigns may avoid accepting them because of the optics as the average person fundamentally finds this very icky and sleazy and corrupt. It’s a visceral reaction. “Clearly [Crockett] thinks that issue is a big deal and a way to resonate with voters — so if what they put out there was false, it’s a great opportunity for the opposition to run on that.” Crockett, who previously practiced as a lawyer, draws a $174,000 annual salary as a member of the House of Representatives. She appears to have fully embraced traditional PACs in the years since her tweet. Public records show she accepted more than $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. These have a spending limit and are different from super PACs, which can also donate to political campaigns. Her donors included a mix of PAC and non-PAC donors including pharmaceutical giants including AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services companies BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors including Lockheed Martin and RTX, and brands including McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon and Toyota. Crockett did not respond to The Post’s request for comment. Meanwhile, Crockett’s disclosures also show she has received lavish trips while in office. In February 2023, just a month after being elected to the US House, she traveled to Doha, Qatar, at a total cost of about $17,500. The trip was paid for by the US Qatar Business Council, which has ties to the pro-Hamas Qatari government. The disclosure shows that while there, she stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Lusail Doha, a five-star waterfront resort. The trip involved meetings organized by the US-Qatar Business Council between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Crockett also went on cultural exchange trips in 2023 paid for by the Indian and Emirati governments, according to her financial disclosure for that year. Those trips were also paid for by the governments of the respective countries. “At a minimum, it looks horrible … Even if it’s just travel expenses covered and a place to stay overnight,” said Foster. “It’s one of those borderline issues where you can form an argument for either side as to whether or not the member traveled as part of their role, and even if there’s a violation, they’re not always reported to FEC — and that’s why these things easily get dicey. “Anything in-kind — even if it’s a spare house and the foreign government member let them stay overnight or covers their expenses, flights, dinners, these are considered in-kind contributions and treated as if given money. “But even then, it’s where a lot of politicians get in trouble. Because they have to be accounted for. It’s a violation in the spirit of it,” said Foster, although he also pointed out that such gifts weren’t necessarily deemed illegal. Crockett’s trip took place before the Hamas terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7 of that year, which left 1,200 Israelis dead and 250 captured as hostages, some of whom are still being held by the terror group. In the same set of disclosures, Crockett also listed a trip she took to Israel. Advertisement

Title: Why BlackRock boss Larry Fink believes he will win over control of the Panama Canal

Full Content:
Larry Fink is playing the long game. With a little time, a possible nudge from President Trump and some on-the-ground lobbying of his contacts in mainland China, BlackRock’s billionaire boss believes he will win approval from the Mainland’s apparatchiks to take control of the Panama Canal, On The Money has learned. Specifically, Fink is looking to close a $23 billion deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to buy 43 ports worldwide — including the two ports that are strategically located on the Atlantic and Pacific sides of the Panama Canal. Until recently, most people didn’t know much about CK Hutchison, which is headed by the mercurial, 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest tycoon. That was until The Donald began talking up the strategic importance of the Panama Canal, one of the busiest waterways for global trade because it easily connects both oceans through a 51-mile deepwater runway. Hutchison holds long-term leases there and at dozens of others including on the Suez Canal. Its stock traded cheaply, and when Trump began to mouth off about the need to exert US eminence at the Panama Canal (the US, after all, built it and controlled the zone until the 1970s), Blackrock saw a way to make some money and get into Trump’s good graces. The other side of the deal wasn’t so happy. And I’m not talking about Hutchison, but its overlords in the Chinese Communist Party who began to “investigate” the tie-up for God knows what other than to prevent the US from gaining a foothold at this vital waterway. The CCP is now threatening to throttle the entire deal. The people at BlackRock are at least posturing in private conversations that they’re not too worried. They tell On The Money to ignore reports that the deal was set to be officially signed by Wednesday. The real due date is the 145-day “due diligence” period that began when the buyout was announced on March 4. The grace period was designed to ensure a complicated buyout involving dozens of ports in many different countries comported with various laws, including getting buy-in from the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yes, the people at BlackRock said they saw the potential for trouble from China Inc., and they built that into the closing schedule. They believe that over this time, they can get the deal approved by the CCP overlords and put American flags back up in the canal zone. “We are proceeding as if this deal will happen,” a BlackRock executive told On the Money as this column went to press. Of course, things could change given the volatile nature of the relations between China and the US and the frenemy dynamic between Trump and Xi. Trump is said to admire the Chinese strongman (and the feeling seems to be mutual), but wary of his obvious global ambitions. Part of Trump, I am told, will never forgive the Chinese for unleashing COVID on the planet, which on top of all the misery it caused, doomed his re-election chances in 2020. But the BlackRock deal is something Trump covets. He mentioned it in the State of the Union address, no less as proof of an American global renaissance. And people at BlackRock believe the deal will get folded into negotiations with the Chinese over Trump’s plan to save the China-owned short-video app TikTok from being banned from US app stores as early as this weekend, and our overall trade negotiations with the Mainland. Barring some last-minute deal implosion (or a realistic new competing bid, which at this stage is unlikely), the White House is scrambling to unveil a plan for a newish US-investor-controlled TikTok any minute now, a structure, as On The Money reported, that the Trumpers believe will comport with a US law that demands the end of Chinese control. But the Chinese will have some buy-in, as I also reported. That includes possibly a minority stake in the new company and it won’t have to part with its algorithm, the important part of TikTok that gins up user engagement and some say, has allowed the Chinese to spy on US users.

Never miss a story. To get around the ban legislation, tech giant Oracle will be part of the planned new ownership group, but more importantly, monitor the algo in its cloud. To get Xi’s buy-in, the Chinese remain a part of the app’s infrastructure, which can operate in the US and retain its value estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Everybody is happy, the thinking goes, and Xi allows the Hutchison-BlackRock deal to proceed. Maybe it’s all wishful thinking on the part of BlackRock — which I might add is the first US based asset manager to open an office in the Mainland. That means Fink is well versed in Chinese politics and knows how to work the system. Or maybe the Chinese will kill the deal because they’re as leery about US global ambitions as we are of theirs. Either way, I’m here simply to report what’s happening, not what will happen, so stay tuned for more. A BlackRock rep had no comment. Advertisement

Editor Activism Brownstone Institute, josh stylman Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: The financial beneficiaries were clear: During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a calculated consolidation of power under the guise of public health. The corporate duplicity was particularly stark during the same period when America was reckoning with racial justice following George Floyd’s murder. Nike proclaimed “standing against racism” while terminating minority employees who would not comply with unscientific Covid shot mandates. BlackRock published reports on “workplace equity” while creating a segregated office system. Google celebrated “inclusion” while their mandate policies disproportionately excluded minority workers who had historical reasons to distrust medical authorities. These same corporations posting solidarity symbols were forcing their lowest-paid workers to choose between experimental injections or feeding their families. Their DEI committees issued statements about “inclusion” while they excluded anyone who questioned the narrative. They celebrated “diversity” in carefully curated public messaging while their mandates disproportionately impacted minority communities—the very people their DEI initiatives were ostensibly designed to protect. This hypocrisy was essentially economic warfare masked by virtuous platitudes. The professional class’s performative empathy enabled the greatest upward transfer of wealth and opportunity in modern history. Their social media activism provided cover for policies that devastated the working class, particularly in minority communities. While they changed their profile pictures to signal virtue, they changed the economic landscape to enforce dependence. The hypocrisy reached its peak during the Roe v. Wade controversy. The same voices passionately defending bodily autonomy in reproductive rights enthusiastically supported government-mandated medical procedures—often in the same social media feeds. I saw this contradiction clearly one day and shared a meme that captured it perfectly: A woman holding a “My Body, My Choice” sign while wearing a “Vaccine Mandate Now!” t-shirt. The irony was obvious—or so I thought. But instead of engaging with the point, a friend of 20 years replied: “The right to an abortion is at stake and unlike vaccine mandates which remain a choice (granted with heavy weight regarding employment for those who choose against)…Equating the two issues works to piss off women for sure but I don’t think does much to further your cause.” Her response characterized vaccine mandates as merely a “choice with heavy weight” while referring to reproductive rights as “my cause”—as if bodily autonomy were a partisan position rather than a universal principle. Most telling was what happened afterward: when I shared trial data and peer-reviewed studies about fertility concerns, there was no reply. The conversation simply ended. This pattern repeated itself across countless relationships—the desire to maintain a manufactured reality proved stronger than decades of friendship or even scientific evidence that might protect loved ones. A simple observation—one that should have been common sense—was treated as ideological betrayal, even with a good friend. That was the moment I realized how deeply people had internalized the manufactured reality, where pointing out contradictions was itself a crime. While professionals virtue signaled from home offices, essential workers faced impossible choices. Those who built careers championing marginalized communities suddenly celebrated stripping basic rights from their neighbors. It was deeply enlightening to observe those who said they were passionate about fighting discrimination celebrating people losing their jobs for making personal medical choices. Their empathy extended exactly as far as their pharmaceutical stock portfolios and/or unwavering faith in government authority—marching against discrimination until it became inconvenient for their tribal interests, rallying against medical coercion until they could enforce it themselves. The demonization of the non-compliant was systematic and crossed into territory that would be considered hate speech if directed at any other group. Major media outlets competed to express the most vitriolic condemnation of the unvaccinated. The New York Times ran headlines like “I’m Furious at the Unvaccinated, while The Washington Post declared that “remaining unvaccinated in public should be considered as bad as drunk driving.” This wasn’t just media rhetoric—it directly programmed public perception and normalized extreme views. A January 2022 Rasmussen poll revealed that nearly half of Democratic voters supported not just fining the unvaccinated, but confining them to their homes, sending them to quarantine camps, and even taking their children. Public health officials cultivated and then amplified this hostility, speaking of a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” creating a narrative of blame that would be used to justify discrimination at a scale unprecedented in modern America. The rhetoric from entertainment figures was particularly revealing. Gene Simmons declared “You’re willing to walk among us unvaccinated, you are the enemy.” Sean Penn took this mandate mentality further, stating “It seems criminal to me…if someone chooses not to get vaccinated that they should choose to stay home, not go to work, not have a job…As long as we’re all paying for these streets, we got to ride safely on them.” His framing perfectly captured the entitled perspective of the wealthy class—comparing basic employment rights to a privilege that could be revoked for non-compliance. Don Lemon advocated for complete social exclusion: “Don’t have the vaccine, can’t go to the supermarket…Can’t go to the ballgame…Can’t go to work…No shirt, no shoes, no service!” Piers Morgan celebrated discrimination: “Love the idea of COVID vaccine passports for everywhere: flights, clubs, gyms, shops. It’s time COVID denying, anti-vaxxer loonies had their bullshit bluff called.” The dehumanization reached new heights as Jimmy Kimmel mocked the unvaccinated seeking medical care: “Vaccinated person, come right in. Unvaccinated person who gobbled horse goo…Rest in peace, wheezy.” Howard Stern demanded mandatory vaccination while cursing freedom itself: “When are we gonna stop putting up with idiots in this country and just say it’s mandatory to get vaccinated? Fuck ’em, fuck their freedom.” Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, who once championed individual rights, declared “Screw your freedom!” These weren’t fringe voices—they were mainstream entertainers with millions of followers, demonstrating how quickly “progressive” entertainment could normalize discrimination and celebrate the stripping of basic human rights. Their audiences, who typically pride themselves on defending the marginalized, cheered calls for persecution when it aligned with their tribal identity and boosted their social capital. ​​The absurdity was obvious to anyone who dared think critically. The architects of this deception are now openly admitting what critics said all along. Janine Small testified before the European Parliament, “No, we did not know whether the vaccine stopped transmission before we rolled it out,” justifying this by saying they had to “move at the speed of science.” These admissions are accelerating. CDC Director Walensky now acknowledges they were “too late” to recognize natural immunity. FDA officials admit myocarditis risks were known earlier than disclosed. Each revelation confirms not just what critics warned about, but what the data had shown from the beginning. Most telling of all, Dr. Deborah Birx, former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator who was one of the chief architects of America’s Covid policies, finally admitted last week: “What we got wrong in public health is we didn’t explain that COVID vaccines were nothing like childhood vaccines…That is not what the COVID vaccine was designed to do. It wasn’t designed against infection.” Yet these admissions come only after the damage is done—after lives were upended, careers destroyed, and basic rights stripped from those who simply pointed to evidence that contradicted the official narrative. For almost five years, anyone pointing out the data and facts now being casually revealed by public health officials faced social and professional exile. The entire justification for mandates, passports, and mass firings was based on claims that public officials and the compliant public never bothered to verify or actively suppressed before coercing millions into compliance. If the vaccines indeed protected the vaccinated, why did anyone else’s medical choices matter? The answer reveals the deeper agenda: This was never about health—it was about enforcing social coercion. As Matt Orfalea brilliantly documented in one of his viral video compilations, media talking heads robotically chanted “no one’s safe unless everyone’s safe,” while a civilized society descended into tribal psychosis. This mass psychosis wasn’t accidental—it was the product of sophisticated reality engineering. The same systems that manufactured consent for endless wars were now deployed to enforce medical and social compliance. But this time, they had new tools: social media algorithms, AI content moderation, and real-time narrative control. And at every level, the deception was coordinated from the top down: Today’s fact-checkers will claim these statements were “taken out of context” but the truth is simpler: These weren’t mistakes or misunderstandings—they were deliberate deceptions designed to drive compliance. Even as internal data contradicted these absolute claims, the messaging remained unwavering. The deception went beyond mere rhetoric. Professor Norman Fenton’s 2021 statistical analysis revealed how trial data was manipulated through deceptive classification of deaths—warnings that were systematically ignored by those who now admit to “mistakes” in coverage. Fenton, along with Professor Martin Neil, has continued this analysis, uncovering progressively more damning evidence of statistical manipulation. Their papers have documented how health authorities systematically misclassified deaths, manipulated test timing, and obscured key data points to maintain the “safe and effective” narrative. Whistleblower Brook Jackson, a regional director at Ventavia Research Group, exposed fundamental violations of data integrity protocols at Pfizer trial sites, including falsified data, improper unblinding of participants, and deliberate suppression of adverse event reporting. Her revelations, which should have immediately halted the trials, were ignored by both the FDA and major media outlets. A forensic analysis of Pfizer’s trial data reveals troubling manipulation. A September 2023 preprint paper titled “Forensic Analysis of the 38 Subject Deaths in the 6-Month Interim Report of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trial” documented a subject who was originally in the placebo group but received a Moderna shot on December 23, 2020. This subject was subsequently hospitalized with Covid on December 31, died on January 11, 2021, and was still classified as an ‘unvaccinated death’ despite having received an mRNA vaccine. This deliberate misclassification skewed mortality data in favor of vaccination. Without this manipulation, the data would have shown the vaccinated were 31% more likely to die. This wasn’t an isolated incident. According to Pfizer’s Post-Marketing Experience Report, released under FOIA, 42,086 case reports of adverse effects were submitted in just the first 90 days after release, including 1,223 deaths. Despite these alarming signals—which should have prompted immediate review—the public was repeatedly assured of the product’s safety, while those raising concerns were systematically silenced. ‘Safe and effective’ may very well be the most consequential lie of our lifetime. In fact, the FDA attempted to hide the trial data for 75 years—a stunning admission of what they hoped to conceal. Only through attorney Aaron Siri’s relentless FOIA litigation was the public able to access these documents at all. When finally forced to release it, the documents revealed nine pages of previously hidden side effects. Authors like Ed Dowd and Naomi Wolf have meticulously documented these deceptions. The manipulation continued at every level. Cities like Chicago employed “dastardly definitions” to obscure real data during the Delta wave. But the truth would eventually emerge through institutions too prestigious to ignore. A groundbreaking Cleveland Clinic study of 51,000 employees found the more shots people received, the more likely they were to get Covid-19. In the authors’ own surprised words: “The multivariable analyses found that… the greater the number of vaccine doses previously received, the higher the risk of COVID-19.” Beyond ineffectiveness, safety concerns mounted. A February 2023 peer-reviewed study in the European Heart Journal evaluated 8.9 million young adults from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, finding that “booster dose is associated with increased myocarditis risk in adolescents and young adults.” Among males, a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine was associated with an “increased incidence rate of myocarditis” within 28 days of inoculation. Studies from Thailand and Switzerland showed similar cardiovascular effects. In a sane and just world, these products wouldn’t have been approved in the first place—let alone mandated or defended at all costs. This data directly contradicted every justification used to persecute the unvaccinated. UK Health Security Agency surveillance reports from early 2022 confirmed these findings, showing higher infection rates per 100,000 in many age groups among the triple-vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. In the years since, dozens of peer-reviewed studies from institutions worldwide have consistently validated these observations, forming an overwhelming body of evidence that the original claims about preventing transmission were false. Yet by then, careers had been destroyed, families divided, and lives upended based on a lie. But data manipulation was only one component of a much larger system designed to protect the narrative at all costs. Social media transformed this engineered reality into an automated system. Platform “adjustments” reduced engagement on vaccine-questioning posts by 95%. Shadow-banning isolated critics while amplifying approved narratives, creating an artificial consensus. AI content moderation ensured only pharmaceutical-friendly perspectives reached wide audiences. The financial entanglement between media and pharma completed the cycle of influence: This wasn’t just bias—it was a carefully structured ecosystem of self-interest. The same system that enriched Halliburton through endless wars now enriched Pfizer through endless boosters. The military-industrial complex had found its medical counterpart. The companies selling vaccines controlled the channels reporting on their safety, creating a perfect closed loop of propaganda: from corporate press release to news headline to social media share to fact-checker verification to public policy. The selective amplification of narratives isn’t an accident—it’s an integral part of reality engineering. Consider this: just last week, West Texas had 58 measles cases, some in the vaccinated, and it made national headlines. Meanwhile, VAERS reports 2,659,050 adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines (including 38,398 deaths) and it’s ignored. The media treats one as a crisis and the other as a conspiracy theory. While VAERS is designed as an early warning system rather than a definitive assessment tool, the stark contrast in how these safety signals were treated compared to other vaccines reveals a troubling double standard in safety monitoring. And that’s before we account for the fact that VAERS is notoriously underreported. This coordinated messaging wasn’t coincidental. A well-documented revolving door between regulators and pharmaceutical companies solidified their dominance over public health narratives. This circular system extended to news coverage itself. Would the public have maintained faith in the “official narrative” if they understood that the “impartial” journalists delivering it had their salaries substantially funded by pharmaceutical advertising? Pfizer alone spent $2.4 billion on TV advertising in 2021. Every “breaking news” segment about the pandemic was effectively “brought to you by Pfizer“—the same company profiting from the promoted solutions. This wasn’t mere bias; it was a fundamental conflict of interest that transformed news programs into pharmaceutical marketing channels with a veneer of journalistic credibility. The legal framework itself exposed the deception. These weren’t medical products subject to normal safety protocols—they were military countermeasures, allowing manufacturers to bypass regulations while enjoying complete liability protection. On February 4, 2020, with fewer than a dozen confirmed Covid cases and zero deaths, the Department of Defense declared it a “national security threat” and activated emergency powers designed for weapons of mass destruction. Science took a back seat to military protocols, with unprecedented emergency declarations occurring in lockstep across countries. Even the language itself was manipulated to accommodate these novel products. The CDC quietly changed the definition of “vaccination” multiple times: from “the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease” to simply “producing protection”—a subtle but critical shift that lowered the bar from actual immunity to mere “protection.” This wasn’t semantic nitpicking—it was a deliberate reframing to retrofit the definition around products that couldn’t meet the traditional standard. By changing the very meaning of “vaccine,” they could claim these gene therapy products belonged in the same category as traditional vaccines, despite their fundamentally different mechanisms and outcomes. The implementation of this control architecture wasn’t improvised—it followed a detailed playbook established before the crisis. Event 201’s recommendations went far beyond theoretical discussions about “misinformation.” The simulation explicitly outlined tactics that would later be deployed: Most disturbing was how precisely these tactics were deployed against the vaccine-injured. Just as the simulation had rehearsed, those reporting adverse effects were systematically labeled as spreaders of “misinformation”—precisely as the blueprint had prescribed. The synchronized global response demonstrated unprecedented coordination across political and geographical boundaries. World leaders simultaneously adopted identical phrases like “Build Back Better,” while implementing remarkably similar policies, regardless of their political orientation or their countries’ specific circumstances. This perfect alignment of messaging and policy represents a level of international coordination never before witnessed—suggesting either an extraordinary coincidence or deliberate orchestration beyond national interests. How does a democratically established public health policy manifest identically across dozens of culturally and politically diverse nations? The answer lies in pre-crisis planning through non-governmental organizations and unelected global institutions. This wasn’t an accident. It was a deliberate construction. Reality itself became a manufactured product, shaped and reinforced through social media algorithms, legacy media narratives, and censorship infrastructure. It was no longer about individual facts—it was about the entire context in which those facts existed. The terrifying part is that once you’re locked into one of these timelines, breaking out feels impossible. Not because people are incapable of critical thinking, but because they are only given the pieces of the puzzle that fit their pre-constructed reality. If your entire media environment tells you vaccine passports were necessary to save lives, then anyone who opposes them must be selfish or dangerous. If your reality tells you vaccine injuries are a rare anomaly, then the people raising concerns must be crackpot lunatics. Once the stage has been set, people don’t need to be actively deceived—they simply need to never see the information that contradicts their version of reality. And the scariest part? This isn’t just about Covid. This is now the model for shaping public perception on every issue. We don’t just live in an era of misinformation. We live in an era where entire realities are constructed and assigned to us, and stepping outside of them comes at a personal and social cost. It’s not just that people were manipulated. It’s that they were placed inside an entirely different timeline—one where dissent itself is unthinkable. Perhaps most chilling is the complete absence of informed consent. The crisis revealed how quickly we abandoned our most sacred protections. The First Amendment wasn’t just challenged—it was systematically dismantled. Free speech, designed to protect the flow of information and allow people to hear all sides, was replaced with coordinated censorship. The same voices who once defended “speaking truth to power” now demanded power to silence dissent. These actions violated not just ethics, but the foundational principles established after World War II to prevent exactly this kind of coercion. The very protections created to prevent medical experimentation without consent were themselves abused. The public was never told they were participating in what amounts to the largest medical experiment in human history. The formulation that received FDA approval was never actually administered—a bait-and-switch that would be criminal in any other context. We still lack proper testing data, with the general population serving as unwitting test subjects. The absence of informed consent was particularly egregious for pregnant women and those of childbearing age. Pfizer’s own December 2020 documents, published by the UK government, recommended against administering these shots to pregnant and breastfeeding women. Their trial informed consent documents explicitly stated: Yet public health officials aggressively promoted these products to pregnant women and young girls without disclosing these warnings. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) rapidly reversed decades of cautious protocol by recommending these products for pregnant women in July 2021, despite the absence of completed clinical trials in this population. This unprecedented departure from established safety procedures placed an entire generation of mothers and their unborn children in an uncontrolled experiment. Those who raised concerns about giving experimental drugs to expecting mothers were branded as dangerous misinformation spreaders. Most shocking of all, the “studies” used to justify safety in pregnancy weren’t conducted on pregnant women at all—they were only done on mice. The medical establishment that once adhered to the precautionary principle of “first, do no harm” now embraced an unprecedented experiment on the reproductive health of an entire generation. VAERS reports of miscarriages and stillbirths increased by 450% in 2022 compared to the previous decade’s baseline. While similar vaccines showed no such signal, authorities dismissed these reports without investigation. The same voices that popularized “believe women” suddenly found endless reasons to doubt women’s experiences when they contradicted pharmaceutical interests—just as my friend had dismissed the contradiction between forced medical procedures and bodily autonomy. While the CDC and public health officials kept assuring the public that the mRNA stayed isolated to the injection site, Moderna’s pitch to Wall Street told a very different story. In a presentation to investors (later removed from their website but archived via the Wayback Machine), Moderna openly boasted about their technology’s ability to deliver mRNA to bone marrow, leading to “HSPC transfection and long-term modulation of all hematopoietic lineages.” Their slides proudly displayed how different LNP (lipid nanoparticle) formulations and repeat dosing could “enhance transfection” across various systems, including bone marrow and human HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) in “humanized-mouse model systems.” And BioNTech’s SEC filings were equally revealing. The company warned investors about “irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell” and the need for “additional testing for long-term side effects.” As Bayer’s pharmaceutical director Stefan Oelrich would later admit, these were indeed gene therapy products—exactly what the public was condemned for suggesting. The semantic debate over terminology served primarily to obscure the novel mechanism of action from the public. The duplicity is breathtaking. One narrative for the public, another for investors. One story about safety for mass consumption, another about risks and biological impact for those funding the operation. The public was not only denied informed consent – they were actively misinformed about the nature of what was being injected into their bodies. I witnessed these stories firsthand while working with filmmaker Jennifer Sharp on her groundbreaking documentary “Anecdotals.” The film provided a nuanced, human lens into the experiences of the vaccine-injured—individuals who trusted the system and paid a devastating price. These weren’t distant statistics or “rare cases” easily dismissed by pharmaceutical companies; they were real people whose lives were upended, first by injury and then by a system that refused to acknowledge their existence. The film’s power lies in giving voice to those who have been systematically silenced. Despite attempts to discredit their experiences as “just anecdotes,” these stories reveal a pattern that can no longer be ignored. Recently, even prestigious mainstream institutions have been forced to acknowledge the reality of persistent vaccine injuries. Multiple research initiatives, including a Yale University study, have begun documenting what was previously dismissed: spike protein persistence long after vaccination, chronic inflammation, immune system disruption, and reactivation of dormant viruses. Yet even as evidence mounts, the truth is often packaged and monetized by the very institutions that denied it initially. Research validating vaccine injuries becomes a commodity, with suffering participants treated as data points rather than patients needing care. Some participants have even withdrawn from these studies, alleging that researchers seem more interested in managing the narrative than addressing their medical needs. For people like Lyndsey, a registered nurse and whistleblower who has documented continuous spike protein production for over 1,500 days since her December 2020 vaccination, these academic acknowledgments come too late and offer too little. Her lab results consistently show immune system dysfunction and inflammatory markers that align with emerging research findings, yet comprehensive treatment remains elusive. These aren’t just statistics or distant characters—they’re our neighbors, friends, and family members who trusted the system and paid an unthinkable price. They don’t need virtual sympathy or performative gestures. They need medical research into treatments. They need financial support for care. Most importantly, they need us to ensure this never happens again. Yet instead of support, those who spoke out faced persecution. The machinery that silenced the injured also targeted anyone who questioned the narrative. I experienced this mob mentality in action when I dared question the prevailing narrative. In 2022, posted what I thought was thoughtful thread comparing vaccine passports to historical patterns of discrimination. As the descendant of Holocaust survivors, I carefully noted that I wasn’t comparing current events to 1943 Germany, but rather warning about how societies normalize discrimination through incremental steps—the exact process that began in 1933. The response proved my point perfectly. The New York Times published a story that left out the historical context of my explanation. A mob formed demanding my resignation from the brewery I had built over a decade. Thousands of messages exist on the Internet about what a horrible person I am. After a successful two decade career in tech and then with the brewery, if you Google my name, most of the content describes a person I don’t recognize. This wasn’t just cancellation—it was digital character assassination. Some friends never spoke to me again. My crime wasn’t comparing current events to the Holocaust’s horrors (never once did I invoke the Holocaust), but rather daring to point out how “checkpoint societies” begin: with the normalization of discriminating against a group by suggesting they pose a threat to public health. The historical parallels were impossible to ignore—yet most disturbing was how few people recognized them. A generation raised without understanding history, critical thinking, or basic scientific principles couldn’t see the patterns repeating before their eyes. Nazi propaganda had portrayed Jews as spreaders of typhus. Now, mainstream media outlets portrayed the unvaccinated as spreaders of Covid, despite clear evidence that vaccination status had no impact on transmission. In both cases, pseudo-scientific claims about public health were used to justify stripping basic rights from a targeted group. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Across the country, professionals who raised concerns faced similar campaigns of intimidation: The pattern was always the same: first the media distortion, then the mob, then the institutional pressure. It is a dangerous world where we cannot say what we believe is right out of fear of losing everything we worked so hard to build. Reality used to be something we shared. Not anymore. In the past few years, we have witnessed something unprecedented: the deliberate fracturing of reality into separate, incompatible timelines. Not based on geography or culture, but based entirely on information streams. In one timeline, the past few years were defined by a heroic global effort to stop a deadly pandemic. Governments acted with urgency, the vaccines were a miraculous solution that saved lives, and those who refused them were reckless threats to public safety. In another timeline, the same period was a coordinated mass psychological operation—one that justified authoritarian overreach, rewrote the social contract, and gaslit the injured while funneling trillions of dollars to corporations. This timeline fracturing represents reality engineering’s ultimate achievement—not just controlling information, but creating entirely separate perceptual worlds where the same events have fundamentally different meanings. When reality itself becomes a manufactured product, traditional concepts of truth and evidence no longer function as social anchors. Depending on which timeline you were placed in, your entire understanding of the world—who was good, who was evil, what was truth—was predetermined. This timeline fracturing represents reality engineering’s ultimate achievement—not just controlling information, but creating entirely separate perceptual worlds where the same events have fundamentally different meanings. When reality itself becomes a manufactured product, traditional concepts of truth and evidence no longer function as social anchors. Depending on which timeline you were placed in, your entire understanding of the world—who was good, who was evil, what was truth—was predetermined. I get it—because I was duped too. I believed them. I was stupid enough to get “vaccinated” without questioning (or really, even looking at) the data. It wasn’t until days later, after a friend pushed me to dig deeper, that I realized I had injected something into my body without any real understanding of what it was. And when I looked at the evidence, I felt betrayed. The difference is, I was willing to admit I was wrong. Others still can’t, because it would mean acknowledging they participated in something unforgivable. It’s not just about ego—it’s about identity. To admit they were wrong means confronting the fact that they enforced a system of persecution against their own friends, family, and neighbors. So instead, they double down. Like victims of Stockholm syndrome, they became ardent defenders of the system that harmed them. Even after being lied to, coerced, and in many cases injured, they couldn’t break free from their psychological captivity. Because once you’ve helped enforce injustice, admitting the truth means confronting your own complicity in mass discrimination. Some relationships are irretrievably lost. Not because we changed, but because acknowledging the truth would require dismantling their entire worldview. They’re trapped in a reality we can no longer share. The path to justice requires dismantling both the machinery of reality engineering and its social enforcement mechanisms. We must acknowledge not just the reality of vaccine injuries—now validated by premier research institutions—but the broader system that made their persecution possible. This means creating spaces where suppressed experiences can be shared without fear, challenging the systemic gaslighting of victims, and demanding accountability from both the architects of this deception and those who enforced it through performative compliance. Real resistance requires exposing the conflicts of interest that drive reality engineering, from pharmaceutical profits to military agendas. Most crucially, we must establish safeguards against the weaponization of social consensus for medical coercion. This includes the ways institutions co-opt and control even the recognition of their own wrongdoing. When prestigious universities finally validate what the injured have been saying for years, it comes with strings attached: data monetization, narrative control, careful limitation of scope. Real justice isn’t just about acknowledgment—it’s about full disclosure and actual care for the injured. To those who now post about the next trending cause while pretending the last few years never happened: Your performative activism has been exposed for what it always was—a social fashion accessory, discarded the moment real courage was required. You’ve lost all credibility to speak about inclusion, justice, or human rights. You didn’t just observe discrimination—you celebrated it. You didn’t just ignore medical coercion—you demanded it. You didn’t just witness the silencing of the injured – you actively participated in it. The pandemic exposed a fundamental truth about modern activism: those who perform virtue the loudest often enable harm the most enthusiastically. The same voices that change their social media profiles for every trending cause revealed themselves as eager participants in actual discrimination when it aligned with their tribal interests. Their commitment to human rights extended exactly as far as their perceived social standing and engagement metrics. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a complete moral collapse masked by algorithmic theater. The Instagram-ification of protest, the reduction of resistance to hashtags, the substitution of profile picture frames for principle—all of it served to create the illusion of justice while enabling its opposite. Real resistance isn’t about social media gestures or convenient forgiveness – it’s about standing firm against oppression, even when—especially when—that oppression comes wrapped in the language of public good. The unvaccinated and vaccine-injured represent the most brutally marginalized groups in recent American history. The scale of this systematic exclusion was unprecedented in modern America: No other group in recent history has faced such comprehensive banishment from society—excluded from workplaces, education, travel, entertainment, and even basic medical care, all while being publicly demonized by mainstream media and entertainment figures. Their story isn’t trending. Their flag isn’t fashionable. Their cause won’t get you likes. But ignoring them doesn’t erase what happened. The same people who loudly signaled their virtue with their vaccine selfies now pretend the past five years never happened. But we remember. And we won’t let them rewrite history. Today, many of those same enforcers have moved on to their next causes—whatever generates the most engagement, whatever lets them perform virtue without risking anything real. But there can be no moving forward without reconciliation. The machinery of social coercion they so eagerly operated stands exposed. Their poses of moral virtue lie in ruins. The next time they change their profile picture for some fashionable cause, remember: They already showed us who they really are when ostracizing dissenters was trending. This isn’t over. The system that turned neighbors against each other remains in place, waiting for the next crisis to weaponize empathy into compliance. We must act now to prevent the next manufactured crisis. This means demanding complete transparency from public health institutions, supporting independent research into treatments for the vaccine-injured, creating legal protections for medical autonomy, and building information networks resistant to censorship. Most importantly, it means holding accountable those who knowingly deceived the public—not through vengeance, but through a truth and reconciliation process that ensures such widespread harm never happens again. The only question is: next time, will you recognize it happening? And if you comply again, what will be left of your humanity when it’s over? True solidarity isn’t measured by profile pictures or hashtags, but by the willingness to stand against injustice when it costs you something. During Covid, genuine allies wouldn’t have been posting selfies with vaccine cards, but rather demanding transparency when the injured were silenced, questioning disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities, and refusing to participate in segregating society—even at the cost of their social standing. They would have recognized that human rights aren’t partisan luxuries that apply only to favored groups, but universal principles that matter most when they’re inconvenient. They would have seen that discrimination dressed in the language of public health is still discrimination. Instead, most self-proclaimed activists failed the most significant civil rights test of our generation, revealing that their commitment to justice extended precisely as far as their social media engagement metrics. The next time a crisis emerges and you’re told who to fear, who to exclude, and which questions not to ask, remember: courage isn’t joining the chorus of the comfortable—it’s speaking truth when the consequences are real. History will remember not just who enforced injustice, but who remained silent as it happened. The long-term damage extends beyond the immediate casualties. Public health institutions have destroyed decades of accumulated trust through their willing participation in deception. The next genuine health crisis will be met with justified skepticism by millions who witnessed this betrayal. Medical authorities have traded long-term credibility for short-term compliance, creating a dangerous void where every health recommendation will now be questioned, regardless of merit. Rebuilding this trust will require not just new leadership, but institutional transparency, accountability for past actions, and the restoration of principles like informed consent and data integrity as non-negotiable foundations of public health.

Bengaluru-based People Tree Hospital secures ₹220 crore investment from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, to expand its capacity to 400 beds and transform Super specialty & Oncology care. This marks BlackRock’s first foray into the Indian healthcare sector, facilitated through the People Tree Hospital platform. The investment—comprising ₹220 crore in the first tranche enables further expansion and a promoter led buyout and seamless exit to early-stage investor & Infosys co-founder, Kris Gopalakrishnan. BlackRock has also made a commitment to invest another ₹210 crore as a green shoe option in the second tranche taking the total funding to ₹430 Crores or 50 Million USD. This will drive expansion, operational growth, and the development of cutting-edge super-specialty and oncology care in India. “This investment from BlackRock will enable the hospital to expand by an additional 250 beds which will support specialties including Oncology, Radiation Oncology, PET-CT, Heart, Lung, and Liver Transplants, as well as Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplants,” said Dr. Jothi Neeraja, MD & CEO of People Tree Hospitals. “Future Plans include a 200-bed super-specialty hospital in a prime location at KR Puram, along with a projected expansion of total bed capacity from 300 to 800 across Bengaluru within the next 2–3 years,” said Dr. Upendra Kandluri. Founded by Dr. Jothi Neeraja and Dr. Upendra Kandluri, People Tree Hospital stands as a beacon of promoter-owned assets, ensuring both scalability and stability. The hospital is wholly owned by Hopkins Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., rooted in the founding family's vision. “With an MBA in Healthcare from Johns Hopkins University, USA, Dr. Abhishek Kandluri drives business development, strategic growth, and expansion. He is supported by Dr. Trupthi Das, an Interventional Radiologist, for delivering clinical expertise. Abhinav Kandluri steers digital marketing, bolstering healthcare awareness, while Mrs. Maheshwari, COO, leads ground operations and digital transformation,” said Dr. Jothi The investment will generate 500–1,000 jobs across Karnataka, further solidifying People Tree's position as a leading healthcare employer. Its strategically located facilities, offering excellent connectivity and commute options, ensure accessibility for all patients. "People Tree Hospital is a unique venture where doctors who understand patient needs are also the ones leading it. This partnership with BlackRock reinforces our mission to deliver world-class healthcare. Our expansion into oncology will enhance cancer care accessibility in India," said Dr. Jothi Neeraja, MD & CEO. In a bold move, the doctor-promoters have chosen complete operational control, minimizing external board influence to prioritize a patient-first approach. “We aim to provide quality healthcare in India with a patient-first approach. The hospital is EBITDA-positive, and this investment validates our credibility while driving the next chapter of innovation and growth," said Dr. Upendra Kumar Kandluri, who spearheaded the BlackRock partnership. The promoters also operate Maarga, a psychiatric care unit & mental health wellness center in Yelahanka and is set to expand from 40 beds to a state of the art 100 beds. Expansion of more units & beds are planned to meet the increasing demand for mental healthcare. The debt funding, structured through Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), ensures operational autonomy for the promoters. BlackRock's rigorous due diligence—conducted by Deloitte, TTA Legal, and Pooviah & Co Legal —reinforces the financial and legal strength of both the hospital and its parent company, Hopkins Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. The secretarial services were provided by Chota CFO, while Seven Mountains served as the investment banker. “With a 12-year legacy, People Tree Hospital is synonymous with great quality, patient-centric care. Our team consists of 100 doctors who are amongst the highly skilled and bring a combined experience of 200 years. The existing facility, spanning 1 lakh sq. ft., with the capacity to expand by an additional 3 lakh sq. ft., presents a significant opportunity for the hospital to expand and meet the growing demand for healthcare. Promoter & hospital owned infrastructure will drive sustainable growth and reinforce enduring trust & long-term stability,” said Dr. Abhishek Kandluri, Head of Strategy & Business Development, People Tree Hospitals.

Title: Tokenized assets in US near $20B as DTCC launches AppChain for real-time tokenized asset management

The DTCC's blockchain strategy aims to revolutionize collateral workflows by enabling real-time settlement and liquidity without sacrificing compliance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has launched a new tokenized real-time collateral management platform, signaling a major institutional commitment to decentralized finance infrastructure in the United States. The initiative is built as an AppChain and represents the first industry-wide use of a blockchain-native financial network to facilitate digital asset-backed collateral operations across markets. DTCC’s platform introduces a live digital collateral system that enables near real-time settlement and automated collateral operations via smart contracts. Built on LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain and supported by DTCC ComposerX, the system operates as part of the broader DTCC Digital Launchpad ecosystem introduced in October 2024. According to the organization, the platform will be publicly demonstrated on April 23 during “The Great Collateral Experiment,” a live showcase of cross-market use cases. The new approach aims to address long-standing inefficiencies in collateral workflows by streamlining asset movement across historically siloed infrastructure. As DTCC’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Nadine Chakar, stated, the model provides a more open, flexible, and institutionally viable framework than earlier digital collateral pilots. Chakar said, “We plan to continue building on this collateral model, engaging with the industry and our regulators to develop the standard for tokenized collateral across global jurisdictions.” CTO Dan Doney further emphasized that real-time collateral mobility represents a “killer app” for blockchain in traditional finance, potentially unlocking liquidity during volatile conditions without compromising operational integrity. DTCC processed $3 quadrillion in securities transactions in 2023 and holds custody of over $85 trillion in assets, making its endorsement a landmark moment in the broader adoption of tokenized systems. DTCC’s launch is emblematic of a broader movement across the US financial sector to integrate blockchain-based tokenization. The market for tokenized real-world assets surpassed $19 billion, up from $10 billion a year prior. Tokenized US Treasuries alone have reached $4.9 billion in value, and tokenized private credit now exceeds $12.4 billion. Parallel initiatives from financial giants, including BlackRock, JP Morgan, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, reinforce the institutional shift. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund is approaching $2 billion in assets under management, while Apollo launched a tokenized private credit vehicle spanning six blockchain networks. The platform’s timing coincides with increased regulatory clarity in the US. The Lummis-Gillibrand Act and the Digital Commodity Exchange Act, both passed in 2024, provided clearer asset classification rules, granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) primary oversight of most digital assets. The rollback of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 has also reduced custody-related restrictions, making it easier for traditional institutions to hold tokenized assets without incurring balance sheet penalties. DTCC’s stated intent to engage with global regulators and define interoperable standards suggests a sustained effort to align technical innovation with evolving legal frameworks. Chakar noted that the group is working to establish the regulatory and legal architecture necessary for implementation, emphasizing cross-jurisdictional collaboration and direct engagement with the buy side. The AppChain-based structure of DTCC’s new collateral platform allows for private, secure asset movement while maintaining compliance and institutional control. Built atop Ethereum-compatible infrastructure, LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu network ensures scalability and data integrity. The platform’s open architecture and common standards are designed to support seamless integration with legacy systems and decentralized networks. This hybrid architecture reflects a growing trend between traditional and blockchain-native finance. Smart contract-based automation is increasingly being used to improve efficiency, transparency, and risk management in legacy financial systems. Pilot programs such as the Canton Network and CME Group’s use of Google Cloud’s Universal Ledger further validate blockchain’s potential as a foundational component of financial infrastructure. Collateral mobility has emerged as a key driver of institutional tokenization adoption. Tokenized systems enable assets to be reused, rehypothecated, and transferred across jurisdictions and platforms without traditional frictions or T+ settlement delays. By enhancing liquidity and capital efficiency, such systems offer compelling use cases for both buy- and sell-side participants.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning If Wednesday was so-called Liberation Day in the United States, Thursday was tariff reaction day in Ireland and other parts of the European Union. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe warned of the possible hit to employment and tax revenues of an extended trade war at a briefing on first quarter exchequer returns, which at least showed a healthy rise in tax revenues for the State. Barry O’Halloran has the details. In our long read on the implications of Donald Trump’s tariffs, Cliff Taylor offers sharp insight into how the US, the EU and the Irish economies will react. Hugh Dooley, meanwhile, gathered reaction from a number of leading Irish food and drink exporters to the United States. Some see it as Brexit mark two, with others eyeing a pivot to different markets, and all of them still trying the process the full implications of Donald Trump’s moves. Larry Fink heads BlackRock, the world’s biggest money manager. In an interview with Joe Brennan in Dublin, he said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months but added that Donald Trump’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. Tom Keogh makes the popular Keogh’s Crisps and the US accounts for 15 per cent of its volume. While tariffs are a threat to his Dublin business he is hopeful that the company can continue to offer its products at a competitive price while also pivoting towards other markets, including Canada. Hugh Dooley spoke to Tom Keogh. Our Interview of the Week is with Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith, who says the tech giant wouldn’t be the success that it is today “if we hadn’t forged this partnership with Ireland” some 40 years ago. He spoke with Ciara O’Brien on a recent visit to Dublin. In her weekly Work feature, Margaret E Ward explores whether conflict in the workplace can actually be good for innovation and results. Is Ireland really suffering a tourism collapse? Recent data from the Central Statistics Office suggests it has fallen off the proverbial cliff so far this year but some industry figures have been scratching their heads at the results. Jim Deegan is professor of tourism policy, director of the National Centre For Tourism Policy Studies and a member of the Economics Department at University of Limerick and offers a view on how we compile our figures for an industry that is hugely important to the economy. Almost 90 per cent of Irish businesses have suffered some form of financial loss and commercial disruption as a result of a cyberattack in the past five years, new research has found. Ciara O’Brien has the details. Stay up to date with all our business news: sign up to our Business Today daily email news digest.

Title: Fidelity crypto IRAs make their debut – All you need to know!

Will Fidelity flip BlackRock’s crypto dominance anytime soon? Fidelity Investments is making waves in the crypto space once again, expanding its digital asset offerings beyond Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). In a significant move, the brokerage firm has launched a crypto-focused Individual Retirement Account (IRA), allowing U.S. investors over 18 in eligible states to directly invest in Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Litecoin [LTC]. With this latest initiative, Fidelity will continue to bridge traditional finance with crypto, offering investors a new gateway into digital assets. Fidelity’s new crypto IRA product comes at a time when financial advisors are increasingly incorporating digital assets into their client portfolios. In fact, according to a recent survey by TMX Vetta Fi, 57% of advisors plan to expand their allocations to crypto ETFs, with a strong emphasis on crypto equity ETFs. That being said, Fidelity’s crypto IRA options offer investors a flexible path to secure their retirement. Custodied by Fidelity Digital Assets and stored in cold wallets, this IRA product comes with zero fees and supports Roth, traditional, and rollover IRA options. The Fidelity Crypto Roth IRA provides tax-free growth potential, while the Fidelity Crypto Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. Additionally, the Fidelity Crypto Rollover IRA offers tax-deferred growth for those rolling over existing retirement accounts. This gives users a stress-free solution for integrating crypto into their long-term financial plans. Needless to say, Fidelity’s performance in the ETF market has been impressive, with its spot Bitcoin ETF, FBTC, recording $118.8 million in inflows. It even surpassed BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $115.9 million in outflows on 2 April. However, its spot Ethereum ETF is yet to attract any significant flows, according to Farside Investors. With Fidelity now expanding its crypto offerings, it even filed to list a Solana [SOL] ETF on the Cboe Exchange, signaling its growing commitment to the digital asset space. Additionally, reports suggest that Fidelity’s digital assets division is preparing tests for a potential stablecoin venture. However, no immediate plans for release have been announced yet. This strategic move positions Fidelity to remain a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. Especially as market dynamics continue to shift.

Impact would be different on different sectors however there is a real risk of all round slowdown in global economies and specifically in US economy which could impact on overall growth across the globe. We are still evaluating impact individually on various sectors and portfolio companies however we are cautiously watching the developments and would do realignments as necessary”. Post the new governor coming in, the RBI’s stance has been reasonably dovish and responsive to the market concerns especially regarding liquidity in the system. Steps taken including the OMOs have resulted in benchmark G-sec rates rallying by ~25-30 bps in this short span of time. Having said that, the upcoming policy would be tricky from the perspective of a volatile global economic scenario with the US imposing a series of tariffs on most of their trading partners including India. The short to medium term impact of the same is expected to be inflationary which may potentially lead to US rates rising. That in turn may put upward pressure on Indian G-sec as well. Hence the RBI may decide to hold rates for now and let the “tariff tantrum” play out. 1.

Source: Reuters The President of the United States has announced more hawkish-than-expected reciprocal tariffs on the trade partners of the US. Per our provisional calculations of the announced 27% reciprocal tariffs on India, could lead to 40bps drag on FY26E YoY nominal GDP growth at the worst. The covid-19 shock is testament to the fact that supply chains do not reorient quickly even when there is a relative comparative cost advantage. As such, our biggest worry at this point would be lower global growth led by US & China. If tariffs continue longer, we see a certain end to ‘US exceptionalism’ and an expansionary Fed, as growth risks may overshadow inflationary concerns. If RMB devaluation discussions emerge strongly, it may be a key global event to watch out for. US services activity moderates; trade deficit narrows The ISM Services PMI fell sharply to 50.8 in March 2025 from 53.5 in February, well below forecasts of 53.

Another 4,429 job cuts were from the downstream effect of cutting federal aid. India says studying impact of 27% US tariff India said on Thursday it was studying the impact of the 27% tariff slapped by the U.S. on its imports and vowed to push for a trade deal this year, signalling a conciliatory tone despite failing to get relief from President Donald Trump’s trade policy. New Delhi is also considering helping export sectors hurt by the new tariffs, an Indian trade ministry source to Reuters said.

Early indications from GIFT Nifty point towards a potential retest of its previous session’s low; while BankNifty is facing resistance at 51,600; while on the flip side, the level of 50,900 will provide the support. In sectoral movement, IT sector has decisively broken through its long-term trendline and previous support zone, signaling a shift to negative trend.

However, while a recovery was observed, intraday volatility remained subdued, keeping traders cautious. Buyers managed to retain dominance throughout the session, with every minor dip being quickly absorbed. Yet, the index continued to oscillate within a well-defined range, creating a stiff resistance ceiling and a strong base, reflecting a lack of decisive direction in the market. Currently, Nifty has established robust support at the Fibonacci 0.382% retracement level of 23,141, signalling it as a strong demand zone at lower levels. The price action suggests a deadlock between bulls and bears, with repeated failures to break key support or resistance levels. Additionally, the index continues to trade below its 200-day EMA, a crucial technical barrier in the near term. With no firm breakout on either side, Nifty remains in a sideways trajectory, stuck in consolidation for the seventh consecutive session. On the technical front, RSI remains below 60, indicating a lack of bullish momentum. This setup points toward a continued consolidation phase, where key support and resistance levels dictate the price action. On the downside, support has shifted to the 23,100–23,000 zone, aligning with the 20 & 50-day EMAs, reinforcing this area as a critical demand zone. The Nifty ended the session at 23,250.10, slipping 0.35% (82.25 points), reflecting a cautiously optimistic sentiment amid upcoming macroeconomic events. With volatility likely to spike around the RBI’s monetary policy announcement, traders are closely watching for a directional breakout. Until then, the index is expected to remain range-bound, navigating a choppy and consolidative phase. Options Market Insights Derivative data signals a mildly bullish undertone, with put writers outpacing call writers, hinting at growing bullish sentiment. The 23,500 strike witnessed heavy call writing (47.34 lakh contracts), solidifying it as a formidable resistance zone. Conversely, substantial put writing at 23,000 (65.14 lakh contracts) highlights strong buyer interest at lower levels. The 23,000–23,100 range has evolved into a demand zone, supported by aggressive put writing, while the 23,300–23,500 range remains a supply zone, as steady call additions continue to act as an overhead barrier. The Put-Call Ratio (PCR) climbed from 0.87 to 1.07, suggesting a shift toward optimistic positioning. With Max Pain at 23,250, bulls have been absorbing bearish attempts, hinting at potential upward pressure in the near term. Volatility Trends India VIX, the market’s fear gauge, eased 0.89% to 13.60, indicating diminished uncertainty. As long as VIX remains below 15, market conditions are likely to stay relatively stable, keeping volatility in check. Market Outlook Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, Nifty absorbed selling pressure well, forming a solid base at support levels and staging a gradual recovery despite muted intraday momentum. With both call and put writers strategically placing positions at key levels, market indecision remains dominant. The failure to break below support has boosted optimism, leading to renewed long positions. However, the index’s position below the 200-day EMA continues to present a major technical hurdle. RSI staying under 60, along with Nifty’s adherence to its 0.382% Fibonacci retracement level, reinforces a defined trading range, where both bulls and bears are actively defending their zones. The 23,500–23,350 region has become a strong supply zone, with persistent call writing flipping previous support into resistance. On the downside, 23,200–23,000 remains a crucial support area, backed by significant put additions and psychological importance. A decisive breakout above 23,300 could trigger bullish momentum, but with call writers maintaining a firm stance and steady put writing at lower levels, consolidation is likely to continue. As long as Nifty trades within 23,500–23,000, a buy-on-dips and sell-on-rise strategy remains favourable. However, a break above 23,300 could ignite short-covering, leading to further upside potential.

In early trading today, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.9% at 34,058.23, following a drop of 2.77% on Thursday. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index fell by 2.81%, having experienced a loss of 3.08% the day before. - Agencies Global shock as Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, sparking threats of retaliation and calls for negotiation worldwide. Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, Head - Research & Outreach, ICRA Limited On India, the reciprocal tariff rate set by the US is 27%, which while quite high, is lower than some other Asian countries such as China (34%), Vietnam (46%), Thailand (37%), Bangladesh (37%), Taiwan (32%), etc. Notably, several items were excluded from the country-specific ad valorem rates. Our early assessment is that the impact of the tariff announcements up to today is negative for some sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metals, auto components and cut and polished diamonds. In our view, this poses a mild downside risk to our growth forecast. However, we suspect that the relative tariff scenario is going to continue to evolve as the year progresses. For now, we are maintaining our baseline GDP growth forecast of 6.5% for FY2026. As a result, we continue to expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 25 bps next week, based on the expectation of a moderation in the CPI inflation to 4.2% on average in FY2026. A final rate cut of 25 bps may be forthcoming in the June or August 2025 policy review, based on the evolving growth inflation dynamics India's electronics industry aims to leverage tariff advantages over China and Vietnam, emphasizing the need for strategic trade agreements. India's IT sector resilient to US tariffs, emphasizing AI, cybersecurity, and enterprise tech solutions, but reciprocal tariffs may pressure industries.

Title: Redefining Resilience: Natural Capital & Wildfire Risk

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Athena Intelligence is a data vendor with a geospatial, conditional, profiling tool that pulls together vast amounts of disaggregated wildfire and environmental data to generate spatial... Across industries, there is a redefinition of value occurring. Traditional financial metrics—centered around earnings, return on assets and financial capital—are increasingly inadequate in the face of systemic risks like climate change, biodiversity loss, and intensifying wildfires. For electric utilities operating in fire-prone landscapes, the path forward is clear: build resilience by understanding and integrating natural capital into core business decisions. Natural Capital IS Financial Capital According to a report by Blackrock, more than half of global GDP—roughly $58 trillion—is moderately or highly dependent on nature. For utilities, this dependence is direct. Power lines traverse forests, transmission infrastructure crosses watersheds, and vegetation management now represents one of the largest operational expenditures in wildfire-prone regions. In short, utilities don’t just impact nature—their economic viability depends on how they interact with it. The first industry to recognize this was agriculture - where weather volatility directly impacts their product quantity and quality. Athena Intelligence's origins are in AgTech and harvest projection. Our understanding of vegetation, terrain and weather trends gives us a unique perspective on your challenges with wildfire. Until recent changes in accounting requirements, the value of this “natural capital”—forests, biodiversity, water, and land—was largely invisible on balance sheets. This is changing. Some public companies have secured billions in sustainability-linked loans by embedding environmental performance into financial strategy. The same logic applies to utilities: the better a utility understands its relationship with nature, the better it can access capital, attract investors, and work with groups like Blue Forest. As utilities develop and refine Wildfire Mitigation Plans (WMPs), there is an opportunity to go beyond CYA-compliance, while reducing expenses. A terrain aware and nature-focused approach aligns wildfire mitigation with ecosystem stewardship— reducing flammable fuel loads, and supporting biodiversity—all while protecting critical infrastructure and communities. Initiatives like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) are already influencing capital flows. Similar to how climate-related risks are increasingly priced into a utility's bonds, nature-related risks are beginning to shape investor expectations. BlackRock’s own research acknowledges that natural capital is not just an ESG issue—it’s a material financial risk. (TNFD Guidance for Water Utilities was issued January 2025.) Utilities that proactively assess and disclose their natural capital dependencies and impacts will be better positioned in capital markets. Those that don’t risk being left behind, especially as insurance markets tighten and cost of capital increases in high wildfire risk zones. For other industries, the global economy is shifting from an “output economy” focused on production and profit to an “impact economy” where consumers seek brands focused on organic production, customer wellbeing and health. The utility equivalent is resilience, sustainability and long-term viability. For your team, this shift is both a challenge and an opportunity. By redefining success to include nature, community, public health and water quality—not just financial performance—utility executives can lead their organizations toward a more climate-resilient future. This includes: Embedding wildfire and nature risk into financial models and board-level strategy. Recognizing and reporting on ecosystem services such as forest health, water quality, and biodiversity. Disclosing material natural capital dependencies and impacts in the context of today's cost savings and the longer-term public health savings by avoiding the impact of wildfires. Aligning wildfire mitigation investments with community resilience. The tools, frameworks, and investor interest are already in motion. What’s needed now is leadership at the local level. As the stewards of critical infrastructure and vast service areas, utility executives have both the responsibility and the opportunity to redefine what resilience looks like in the 21st century. That starts by valuing nature—not just as a risk to be managed, but as a form of capital to be protected, enhanced, and accounted for. Boston Consulting Group just did a paper on this topic. It starts: As we progress through the second half of this decade, corporate climate action is becoming an increasingly vexing challenge. Evidence is mounting that the tangible impacts of climate change are being felt now, and stakeholders are demanding action. As 2030 climate targets approach, companies are increasingly having to integrate their climate action into their strategic capital allocation decisions. Unfortunately, achieving these targets is proving harder and more expensive than anticipated, partly due to rising project and capital costs in the post-COVID era. Adding to the pressure, the stakes and compliance costs are escalating. Heightened scrutiny from the ACCC and ASIC, coupled with recent legislation on Mandatory Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, requires companies to have credible plans and assess risks across a range of uncertain, and often unknowable, future scenarios. It’s getting complicated.

Title: NYTimes: Trump Deportations Will Raise Wages
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/04/03/nytimes-trump-deportations-will-raise-wages/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T21:43:50Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump’s deportations may give a 17 percent wage gain to American construction workers, according to the New York Times. The wage gain is predicted by a New York Times article that described how cheap migrant labor helped a builder prepare a $2.65 million home for sale to wealthy Americans. Without immigrant workers, Mr. Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget, the article lamented: A shock to the labor market by a loss of workers through deportation and the fear of deportation could potentially drive up wages … Without immigrant workers, [builder Nathan] Anderson’s labor costs could jump by 17 percent, adding $116,000 to his budget. “Why is that so bad?” said a puzzled Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, adding: In this particular example … someone in the top 1 percent or 1/10 of 1 percent can afford that house, but they’re going to have to pay some more for it. Yet aat the same time, working class Americans– bricklayers, concrete workers, carpenters, what have you — are going to make more money. So it seems like a really good redistribution of income from the very top to more middle-income people. That would be good. The $2.65 million house was priced at almost six times the average cost for a new home in Arizona. The New York Times reporter, Ronda Kaysen, explained how the cost of the building’s foundation, for example, would rise by 20 percent: Last September, once the architectural drawings were complete, the building permits approved and the site prepared for construction, a crew arrived to lay the foundation, costing about $59,000. On the busiest days, as many as eight workers were on site. Some days, as few as three or four. Almost 70 percent, or $40,000, of the foundation budget, went to labor. About 90 percent of the crew were immigrants. Without them, [Anderson’s] labor costs could swell to $49,800. The newspaper’s admission of 20 percent pay cuts may be a gross underestimate of the economic damage. In 2018, for example, Blaine Taylor, a U.S. construction worker, told Breitbart News that construction wages in California were roughly $45 an hour in the late 1980s. By 2018 — nearly two decades after illegal aliens began flooding the industry — wages were standing at just $11 an hour, he said. The New York Times article illustrates the widespread recognition in media outlets and banking reports that President Joe Biden’s mass-migration policy cut wages for Americans while President Donald Trump’s deportation policy is raising wages for Americans. “A reduction in labor supply means upward pressure on wages,” Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch on January 23. “The implication of what’s happening with deportations … is that we should expect continued wage growth in 2025” in construction, Matt Saunders, vice president of building products research at John Burns Research and Consulting, said mid-March. “Low-wage migrant workers might depress wage gains for other low-wage workers,” the JP. Morgan investment firm said March 26. For a decade, Breitbart News has tracked these admissions, which were rare until the election of Joe Biden in 2020. The admissions rapidly expanded once business groups began to argue in Biden’s term that low-wage migration could reduce inflation from housing and other sources. That self-serving argument marked a sudden reversal from the prior self-serving insistence that migration had a negligible impact on Americans’ wages. Many left-wing reporters have persuaded themselves to tout the business groups’ new anti-inflation argument for cheap immigrant labor, said Camarota: There’s still the perception that business interests are in the Republican Party, and as such, it’s very tempting for [pro-migrant] reporters to say, “Look, you’re screwing your own people here — Republicans want this immigration!” It lets the reporters who are generally progressives say “We’re concerned about businesses and we’re concerned about the availability of labor they have, and we’re looking out for this big part of your Republican constituents. Why aren’t you listening?” Unfortunately, what it suggests is a lot of reporters [have] a deep concern for the plight of immigrants, not the wages of working class Americans. Camarota’s narrative is illustrated by another New York Times article on March 3. The impact [of deportations] is being felt not only in immigrant homes and communities, but also in the industries that rely on immigrants as a source of willing and inexpensive labor, including residential construction, agriculture, senior care and hospitality. American consumers will soon feel the pain. “Businesses across industries know what comes next when their work force disappears — restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores struggling to stay open, food prices soaring, and everyday Americans demanding action,” said Rebecca Shi, chief executive of the American Business Immigration Coalition. The reporter in the construction article explained how she came up with the estimated wage gains: Mr. Anderson sat down with The New York Times and estimated how his labor costs might change without immigrant workers, based on his personal experience, and using this house as a model. The Times also applied national and regional labor trends to his calculations, and analyzed construction industry work force demographics from census survey data. Given that Trump policies have affected both documented and undocumented immigrants, we did not differentiate between the two groups. The reporters’ narrow focus on claimed labor shortages also hides the impact of migration on productivity numbers or employers’ willingness to fund and train the millions of alienated men who have fallen out of the economy, said Camarato. “Employers can respond to [wage gains] by changing their recruitment practices, but also adopting more productive production, such as [the use of] more pre-fabrication than trying to build everything on site,” he said. “Labor-saving devices and techniques that increase productivity, ultimately, would be very good for [national] growth and prosperity,” he said. The same economic trend is visible in the white-collar sector, where the H-1B program has been used by investors, executives, and Indian hiring managers to divert wages and opportunities away from millions of American college graduates. The inflow of mixed-skill visa workers has also stalled corporate productivity and innovation, so denying massive gains to shareholders and tax collectors. So far, Trump’s deputies have not curtailed the counterproductive H-1B program. But some political and economic leaders argue that labor shortages will boost productivity and innovation. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President J.D. Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. “The key question you have to ask when it comes to immigration is, who do you favor? Owners of capital or workers?” said Camarota. “In general, a larger share of [national income] has been going, over time, to owners of capital. And I think it’s one of the sources of dissatisfaction, indirectly, for the working class,” he said, adding: “Less immigration then is most definitely good for the working class, including the immigrant working class, already.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Financial technology startup Plaid closes $575M investment at $6B valuation

UPDATED 17:41 EDT / APRIL 03 2025 by Maria Deutscher Plaid Inc., a startup that provides software for connecting financial applications with one another, has raised $575 million in fresh funding. The raise was led by a group of new investors that included Franklin Templeton, Fidelity and BlackRock. Plaid detailed in its announcement of the round today that several returning backers chipped in as well. The company’s outside funding now stands at about $1.3 billion. Plaid is worth $6 billion post-money, less than half the valuation it received following a funding round in 2022. However, the company’s valuation is higher than the $5 billion that Visa Inc. would have paid to buy it in 2020. The acquisition fell through after regulators raised antitrust concerns. Many financial applications require the ability to interact with users’ bank accounts. An expense tracking tool, for example, must retrieve information about recent purchases to measure spending. Other services require the ability to make payments and manage investments. Connecting an application to bank accounts is a highly complicated process. Different banks configure their systems in different ways, which requires developers to learn the nuances of each financial institution’s software. There’s also the matter of complying with financial regulations and fending off cyberattacks. Plaid offers a platform called Link that eases the task. It provides prepackaged integrations with more than 12,000 financial institutions, which removes the need for developers to build everything from scratch. Link can add bank account connections to web, desktop and mobile apps. The company also offers a second version of the platform called Modular Link. It allows developers to more extensively customize the interface through which users connect their bank accounts to an app. A software team could, for example, redesign the interface pane that displays error messages. After connecting to a bank account, financial services can use Plaid’s technology for a range of tasks. The software is capable of retrieving information about the user’s purchases and investments. It’s also possible to make a bank transfer or configure recurring payments for a subscription. Plaid’s platform is used by thousands of customers, including Zillow Group Inc., Flexport Inc. and other major tech firms The software maker says that those companies use its technology to support hundreds of millions of consumers. According to TechCrunch, Plaid’s latest funding round follows a year in which its revenue climbed 24%. The company also moved closer toward profitability by returning to positive operating margins. It will use most of the new capital to provide liquidity for employees. The funding round is expected to be Plaid’s last before it goes public. However, the company reportedly doesn’t plan to list its shares in the foreseeable future.

Among the topics discussed in meetings conducted this week, the SEC heard arguments on in-kind redemptions and staking for crypto ETPs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force held separate meetings on April 1 with representatives from BlackRock and the Crypto Council for Innovation’s (CCI) Proof of Stake Alliance to discuss regulatory issues related to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). According to memos about the meetings, BlackRock discussed the in-kind redemptions for crypto ETPs traded in the US. At the same time, the CCI included staking on ETPs among the topics discussed with the regulator. BlackRock’s attendees included senior representatives from regulatory affairs, product engineering, ETF capital markets, and federal policy. During its session with the Crypto Task Force, BlackRock presented a document detailing existing workflows and the role of market participants supporting the cash model used in ETPs. The firm also addressed how these systems could apply to potential in-kind models for future crypto-based funds. Separately, the SEC met with members of the Proof of Stake Alliance under the Crypto Council for Innovation. The group, composed of representatives from firms such as a16z, Paradigm, Consensys, Alluvial, Lido Labs Foundation, and Marinade, discussed staking-related topics and their implications for crypto ETPs. The agenda included reviewing various staking models, including liquid, custodial, and delegated non-custodial staking. Participants also presented staking-as-a-service industry principles intended to inform the regulatory treatment of validator operations and user participation in proof-of-stake networks. The discussion also touched on how staking rewards, validator responsibilities, and service provider relationships factor into the risk profile and valuation of potential staking-enabled crypto ETPs. The SEC’s engagement with BlackRock and the Proof of Stake Alliance signals continued institutional interest in advancing regulatory clarity for crypto financial products. The discussions follow an earlier meeting held on Feb. 5, during which the SEC’s Crypto Task Force met with representatives from Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to evaluate the potential inclusion of staking within crypto ETPs. Participants, including Jito Labs CEO Lucas Bruder and Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, argued that staking is essential to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. They noted that excluding staking from ETPs could diminish investor returns and compromise the functional utility of PoS assets. Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital representatives proposed two models to address the SEC’s concerns. The “Services Model” allows partial staking through third-party validators while maintaining liquidity for redemptions, while the “Liquid Staking Token Model” enables ETPs to hold liquid staking tokens. While no regulatory outcomes were disclosed, the meetings form part of the SEC’s ongoing review process as it evaluates technical and legal frameworks regarding crypto ETPs.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy With more big industrial real estate tenants looking to own the spaces they use, a prominent off-price retailer put down a quarter of a billion dollars for one of its distribution centers in Southern California as its business grows. Burlington, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, paid more than $257 million to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse from the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock. Burlington has been the sole tenant at the Inland Empire facility since it was completed in 2019. Colliers (CIGI)’ Mark Zorn and Cory Whitman represented Burlington and announced the deal for 21600 Cactus Avenue in Riverside, Calif., while CBRE (CBRE) represented BlackRock. Burlington’s move from tenant to owner comes as it expands its operations. The publicly traded company opened 101 new stores in 2024 and plans to open another 100 locations this year. The deal also demonstrates the demand for and the value of new warehouse development in the nation’s biggest market for logistics and industrial space. “The Inland Empire industrial market continued to see elevated demand in Q4 2024, with leasing activity surpassing 10 million square feet for the third consecutive quarter,” Zorn said in a statement. “Burlington’s commitment to this location is a testament to the Inland Empire’s status as a leading industrial market.” Gregory Cornfield can be reached at gcornfield@commercialobserver.com.

Title: BlackRock and SEC explore next phase of crypto ETFs in closed-door task force meeting

Time Published: 2025-04-03T19:53:06Z
Full Content:
Share this article BlackRock and the US Securities and Exchange Commission met this week to discuss potential changes to crypto exchange-traded product workflows, including transitioning to in-kind redemptions for digital asset funds. The closed-door meeting, held on Monday, April 1, with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force, focused on the structure and mechanics of crypto ETFs. BlackRock’s team is understood to have discussed in greater depth the potential for in-kind redemptions, a model the firm has already filed for in its spot Bitcoin ETF. In-kind redemptions allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset, such as Bitcoin, instead of cash, improving efficiency and reducing costs. The meeting signals that such redemptions may be gaining regulatory traction. The conversation comes as BlackRock’s crypto exposure continues to grow, with over 574,000 BTC held in its IBIT fund and more than 1.1 million ETH in its Ether ETF. Senior representatives from BlackRock’s regulatory, product, and ETF teams participated in discussions on adapting existing ETP workflows to support in-kind systems. Since approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, the SEC has mandated cash-only redemption models, citing custody and compliance risks. Nasdaq’s filing for BlackRock’s in-kind redemption model states that such a structure would align crypto ETFs more closely with traditional commodity-based ETFs.

Title: BlackRock’s BUIDL fund pays $4.17M dividends in March, surpasses $25M in total payout

The dividends paid in March are nearly double the previous all-time high of $2.1 million, registered in July 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) distributed $4.17 million in dividends during March, marking the largest monthly payout for a tokenized Treasury fund. According to a report by BUIDL’s issuer, Securitize, the record-setting distribution brings BUIDL’s cumulative dividend payments to $25.4 million since its inception, reflecting increasing institutional interest in on-chain exposure to traditional financial products. Additionally, Securitize noted that the March record is roughly 2x larger than the previous $2.1 million peak registered in July 2024. The fund, which tokenizes a money market strategy comprised of US Treasuries and cash equivalents, provides daily dividend payouts Monday through Friday, giving investors near real-time yield accruals directly on-chain. Tokenized US Treasury funds are emerging as a foundational layer in on-chain finance. By providing verifiable, yield-bearing backing, they offer alternatives to crypto-native stablecoins. The sector is the second-largest in tokenization, with nearly $5 billion in size. BUIDL’s assets under management (AUM) reached an all-time high of $1.93 billion on March 27, less than a month after crossing the $1 billion threshold. According to data from rwa.xyz, its rapid growth places it among the largest real-world asset (RWA) products on public blockchains, trailing only four stablecoins in market capitalization. A key driver of BUIDL’s AUM expansion is Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDtb, which uses the fund for 90% of its backing. As of the latest figures shared by Ethena Labs, USDtb has $1.29 billion in exposure to BUIDL, accounting for 67% of the fund’s total market value. USDtb, designed to maintain price stability through a delta-neutral strategy, allocates reserve capital into BUIDL to earn yield from US Treasury exposure. This structure has made BUIDL a critical component in Ethena’s stablecoin design, directly linking traditional fixed-income instruments to crypto-native applications. Notably, MakerDAO’s Spark will hold a vote on April 3 to decide whether the protocol should follow its plan to invest $500 million in BUIDL. This would boost the fund’s market size even further, making participation in investments by DeFi protocols represent 74% of current numbers. BUIDL has been expanding its offering to various blockchains. After its launch on Ethereum, the fund expanded to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Aptos, and Solana more recently. This multi-chain deployment is part of Securitize’s strategy to make institutional-grade financial products natively accessible across decentralized environments, facilitating integrations with protocols and wallets across ecosystems. Yet, $1.72 billion of BUIDL shares are issued on Ethereum’s blockchain, nearly 90% of the fund’s size.

Title: Plaid’s $575 Million Round Signals Strength Despite Valuation Drop and Delayed IPO

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726. Tracking fintech, banking & financial services innovations since 1994 Financial data network Plaid announced it has brought in $575 million in a round led by new investor Franklin Templeton, with existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital, as well as new investors BlackRock and Fidelity, also contributing. The Venture Round is a sale of common stock; Plaid has directly issued the new shares to raise capital. In a company blog post announcement, Plaid CEO and Co-Founder Zach Perret said that the funds will be used “to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring restricted stock units (RSUs) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to our current team.” While today’s funds increase Plaid’s total funding to $1.3 billion, the round revealed a decreased valuation for the California-based fintech. Once valued at $13.4 billion during fintech’s brief hype days of 2021, Plaid’s valuation is currently less than half that, at $6.1 billion. In explaining the significant gap in valuation to the Financial Times, Perret said, “In 2025, tech multiples have massively compressed between the time that we raised last and today. What I will say is that the fundamentals of the business underneath are dramatically stronger than they were in 2021. Revenue is much higher.” Plaid’s $575 million comes at a time of growth for the company. Not only did the fintech expand its product suite, but it also saw an increase in organizations building with its account connection tools. In 2024, Plaid boasted positive operating margins, saw a revenue increase of more than 25%, and experienced an increase in both the number companies and markets it serves. As a result, more than 1 in 2 Americans have used Plaid. ​If you are wondering when Plaid plans to IPO, you’re not alone. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Plaid will not go public this year, but it plans to continue tracking towards a public listing. “An IPO is certainly a part of the longer-term plan. We have not attached a specific timeline to it,” Perret told the Financial Times. “As I’ve said in the past, it will not be this year.” Plaid’s decision to hold off on an IPO may also be a strategic move given the evolving state of open banking in the US. Unlike regions such as the UK and EU, where open banking is well-established and governed by clear regulatory frameworks such as PSD2, the US market remains in flux. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is currently working toward finalizing its proposed Personal Financial Data Rights rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, but the lack of formalized standards has created uncertainty for data aggregators like Plaid. By delaying its public debut, Plaid may be seeking to ride out regulatory headwinds and position itself on more solid ground once clearer guidelines are in place. In addition to regulatory clarity, Plaid may also benefit from a recognition and understanding from mainstream consumers, many of whom have never heard the term “open banking.” Once regulations go into effect, banks will slowly begin in educate consumers on the benefits of open banking, and the concept of the value that Plaid brings will come to light. This regulatory clarity, combined with consumer understanding, could improve investor confidence and support a stronger valuation when the company ultimately decides to go public.

Title: BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffs
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/03/blackrock-chief-sees-risk-of-brief-recession-in-us-amid-trump-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:59:31Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months, after its president, Donald Trump, unleashed a range of tariffs on the world this week. However, he said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin on Thursday that the new administration’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. The possibility of a downturn in the US is “not insignificant” in the next few months, said Mr Fink, who has led the growth of BlackRock into an institution with $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management since he co-founded it in 1988. “At the same time, as the president’s policies kick in in relation to deregulation and streamlining permitting [for various projects], we could see a real growth agenda that offsets some of the recessionary short-term pressures,” he added. The US president outlined on Wednesday a raft of tariffs being phased in over the next week, including a baseline charge of 10 per cent on imports, rising to 20 per cent for the EU, 30 per cent on China and 46 per cent on Vietnam. Stock market indices across Asia, Europe and Wall Street fell on Thursday – wiping $1.7 trillion off the value of companies listed on the S&P 500 index by midday in the US alone – as investors digested the sweeping tariff announcements and potential for retaliation. Gold, seen as a safe haven in times of turbulence, reached a fresh record of almost $3,168 an ounce. US government bond yields – or market interest rates – also fell as investors bet the US Federal Reserve will accelerate interest rate cuts this year to prop up the economy. Yields on European government bonds also dipped. Mr Fink said a US trade war with Europe and other trading partners does not need to follow, as Mr Trump is merely seeking to reciprocate part of what other countries are imposing on imports from the US. He added that Europe must work now to become more competitive. “There does not need to be a true trade war,” he said. “The question is: is there any validity to what the US is doing and saying? Should we have more symmetry in our trading agreements? That’s all. That’s what the reasoning is.” When asked if he agreed with Mr Trump’s approach, he answered: “It’s not for me to agree. But I understand the logic behind it.” Mr Trump said that the new tariffs were “approximately half” of what its trading partners “have been charging us”. That halved figure includes “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating,” he added. Ireland’s pharmaceutical sector which accounts for 60 per cent of exports from the State to the US, has so far avoided the new EU duty. However, Tánaiste Simon Harris said in the Dáil on Thursday that “we shouldn’t fool ourselves that there aren’t further plans in relation to sector specific measures, including pharma”. The EU is “preparing for further countermeasures” to protect its interest, but focused, for now, on trying to negotiate with the Trump administration, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland said: “It is important that our response is considered and measured. Any action should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens.” “A confrontation is in no one’s interests,” he added.

Title: Could Panama Throw a New Wrench Into BlackRock’s Ports Deal?

Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Matt Ragen/Shutterstock April 3 (Reuters) – BlackRock could hit another roadblock in its attempt to secure control of two flagship ports near the Panama Canal once the Central American country releases an audit on a 25-year concession granted to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Final signature of the deal in Panama, part of a broader $22.8 billion transaction between a BlackRock-led group and CK Hutchison including over 40 ports in 23 countries, is expected to be delayed as criticism grows in China, sources told Reuters last week. The deal’s definitive documentation was initially expected to be signed by April 2, BlackRock and CK Hutchison said last month when they announced the deal. As China’s market regulator begins an antitrust review on the deal, Panama’s government is requesting documents from CK Hutchison, a telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, to complete an audit on the concession. Panama’s Maritime Authority also asked BlackRock and CK Hutchison to provide details of their deal, which must ultimately be green-lit by Panama. The deal includes 90% of the Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports at either end of the Panama Canal. The Panama ports audit was announced in January by the Comptroller General office as “the most important” of a series of reviews of key infrastructure concessions in Panama. Comptroller general Anel Flores said last week that results are expected in the coming ‘days or weeks.’ Flores has criticized previous audits, including one completed before CK Hutchison’s concession was renewed in 2021, saying they were limited to confirming the fulfillment of operational goals. “We’ll begin a severe, strong audit of those books and company,” he said earlier this year. Flores has also complained about the ‘poor yield’ of the contract for Panama and the slow delivery of documents requested from CK Hutchison. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. Panama’s Supreme Court will have the last word on that. If the Comptroller General finds irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, complicating the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal and possibly creating grounds for international arbitration, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump has celebrated the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal, while China and pro-Beijing voices have criticized it, thrusting the firms involved and the Panamanian ports into the fray of the U.S.-China trade war. However, any hurdles to the deal increase the risk of a hardening of Trump’s policy towards the canal. Since taking office in January, Trump has escalated his threats of controlling places he says could better serve U.S. interests, like the Panama Canal and Greenland. The ports are not part of the canal. However, American officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison’s control of them, along with other concessions to Chinese firms in Panama, represents a security risk for the canal’s operation. CK Hutchison has said the sale of the ports was purely commercial and unrelated to politics. Panama says the canal is operating in a fair and secure way, granting equal access to vessels from all origins. Pro-Beijing media have published a series of commentaries criticizing CK Hutchison’s deal, depicting it as a betrayal of China and a “perfect cooperation” with the U.S. strategy to contain China. The pressure on CK Hutchison has deepened concerns that Hong Kong’s edge as a financial hub will erode further amid geopolitical tensions. The purchase is in line with BlackRock’s recent investment drive in infrastructure, and it secures the fund manager a strong position near an essential global trade hub. The broader deal including many other ports worldwide could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported. The deal has also been described as helping BlackRock and CEO Larry Fink win political capital with Republicans, who in some states have restricted or banned BlackRock from managing retirement or treasury funds over the company’s policies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing. Some Republicans were reconsidering BlackRock bans after Trump praised the deal.
