AN ONLINE FUNDRAISER to cover the funeral expenses of a teenager who drowned in Co Meath has hit its target ahead of tomorrow’s service. Kofi Jackson Owusu, aged 15 and from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth, died last Friday after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said the school was heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He described Kofi as “very kind and very caring”. Advertisement Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He was a member of Redeemer Celtic Football Club in Dundalk and the club started a GoFundMe to support Kofi’s family with funeral costs. The club described Kofi as a “highly respectful youngster” who was a “credit to his loving family”. The online fundraiser has surpassed its goal ahead of Kofi’s funeral service tomorrow. His funeral service will take place at The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Miracle Land, Castletown Road, Dundalk tomorrow at 1pm. Afterwards, the congregation will proceed to St. Patrick’s Cemetery for burial. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Title: NATO’s 5 percent spending pledge is a threat to people and the planet
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/26/natos-5-percent-spending-pledge-is-a-threat-to-people-and-the-planet
Time Published: 2025-06-26T13:32:50Z
Full Content:
The alliance’s spending surge will prompt war, cut services and worsen the climate crisis. NATO’s leaders agreed this week to invest 5 percent of their countries’ gross domestic product (GDP) on “core defence requirements as well as defence and security-related spending by 2035”. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called it a “quantum leap” in spending that would guarantee “freedom and security” for the military alliance’s one billion people. It certainly is historic in terms of military escalation, but will it deliver security – and if so, for whom? The headline demand for 5 percent GDP spending has been so loud, it’s easy to forget that for a long time, many NATO members considered the previous 2 percent goal either unachievable or unimportant. NATO first committed to its 2 percent GDP goal in 2002, but by 2021, only six of its members had achieved it. Yet three years later, 23 members had met the goal and all 32 are expected to comply by the end of 2025. This week, NATO has committed to more than doubling its spending to 5 percent of GDP. This will be partly met through creative accounting and reflects a desire to trumpet a big number to satisfy a petulant President Trump. The 5 percent headline includes 1.5 percent spent on military-related infrastructure, which could be broadly defined to include civilian expenditure. Even so, it reflects a huge escalation of military expenditure over the next decade from an already very high level. Last year, NATO spent $1.5 trillion on the military – more than half of global military spending. If members comply with the core 3.5 percent target by 2030, that would mean a total of $13.4 trillion in military expenditure. It’s an impossible figure to grasp, but if you stacked it in one-dollar bills, you could make almost four piles that reach the moon. It could also be distributed as a one-off cash bonus of $1,674 to every person on the planet. In reality, the money will be diverted – most of all from social and environmental spending – even though 30 percent of Europeans report difficulty in making ends meet and climate scientists warn that we have two years left to keep temperature increases below the international target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who fought for a partial exemption from the 5 percent goal, was the most honest about this costly trade-off: “If we had accepted 5 percent, Spain would have to spend by 2035 an extra 300 billion euros on defence. Where would it come from? From cuts in health and education.” Social and environmental spending is already on the chopping block. In February, the United Kingdom announced it would reduce its aid budget to 0.3 percent of GDP to pay for military spending increases – a year after it won an election committing to increase foreign aid. Belgium, the Netherlands and France followed suit, announcing aid cuts of 25 to 37 percent. The United States, under Trump, has decimated its overseas aid and climate programmes and reduced healthcare funding while proposing a record $1 trillion expenditure on the Pentagon. Europe is falling far behind on its own environmental and social goals, with its primary funding vehicle, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), expiring in 2026. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) concludes that most European NATO members will be unable to meet the 3.5 percent NATO target without cutting budgets, raising taxes or changing fiscal rules. NATO’s spending spree will not only divert money – it will worsen the climate crisis. As one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, it is investing in more gas-guzzling jets, tanks and missiles. Military emissions are notoriously hard to track due to limited data, but one report estimates that 3.5 percent of GDP spending would lead to 2,330 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2030 – roughly the same as the combined annual emissions of Brazil and Japan. NATO’s justification is that increased investment is needed to confront the threats of “Russia” and “terrorism”. Yet there is no rationale behind the 5 percent target or details on why threats to NATO have so drastically increased. Nor is there self-examination on how NATO’s actions partly set the stage for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has increased military spending, but it still spends 10 times less than NATO. Nor could it catch up militarily with NATO’s 32-strong alliance, given its economy: $2 trillion in 2024 (nominal GDP), compared with $26 trillion for non-US NATO countries and $29 trillion for the US alone. As for “terrorism”, the idea that NATO’s increased spending could deter it ignores the failures of the “War on Terror”, where NATO interventions in Afghanistan and Libya prompted instability and fighter recruitment. The security NATO seems most concerned with is that of its arms firms. Long before Trump’s pressure, arms firms have pushed for higher European military spending through lobbying groups like the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). They have successfully made military security an overriding European Union objective, winning ever more public money for research and industry support. Now they are reaping the rewards with booming revenues and profits. Before the NATO summit, BlackRock released an investment report celebrating the arms industry as a “dynamic growth industry” and a “mega force” that will drive investment trends in the coming years. NATO’s idea of security diverts money from social needs, worsens the climate crisis, rewards arms firms profiting from global conflict, and chooses war over diplomacy. Its bellicose stance in The Hague this week makes it one of the greatest threats to global security – even to life on this planet. It is up to the peoples of NATO countries to reject this deadly path and reclaim security based on cooperation, justice and peace.

Luxembourg-based Quintet Private Bank, with operations across Europe and the UK, has integrated private markets exposure into its client portfolios. Clients with relevant portfolios can now access actively managed exposure to alternative assets, including private equity, private credit, and real assets. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more These are offered through selected evergreen private markets funds, complementing traditional allocations to equities, fixed income, and commodities. This integration was facilitated by a collaboration with BlackRock and the implementation of the European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) framework, effective since last year. This framework reduces liquidity and operational constraints, enabling continuous capital raising, reinvestment, and flexible redemptions. This allows investors to access private markets with simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional public markets. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Bryan Crawford, group head of investment & client solutions and member of the Authorized Management Committee at Quintet, said: “Diversification is a cornerstone of portfolio resilience, especially during periods of heightened volatility. “We are therefore delighted to partner with BlackRock to integrate exposure to private markets in client portfolios, supporting increased diversification and creating new opportunities to access long-term growth themes.” Quintet’s private markets offering includes BlackRock’s private markets platform, which manages over €600bn in assets pro forma across multi-alternatives and private equity strategies for investors in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. BlackRock EMEA Wealth Alternatives Specialists Team head Fabio Osta said: “By supporting the integration of private markets into wealth portfolios, we are making investing in alternatives easier and more accessible for a broader range of investors so they can benefit from the typically higher returns and diversification the asset class offers.” This announcement follows Quintet’s launch of multi-manager UCITS funds last year, also co-designed with BlackRock. These actively managed, single-asset-class funds, exclusive to Quintet clients, combine third-party managers to enhance diversification and portfolio performance. Earlier this year, Quintet introduced Future+, a sustainable investment mandate developed with BlackRock, adhering to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

The 10 models are the first to be added to CAIS's recently launched Models Marketplace and feature substantial exposure to private markets. June 25, 2025 Alternative investment platform CAIS unveiled the first investment models to be added to its recently launched CAIS Models Marketplace. The new line-up includes multi-asset model portfolios, three each from BlackRock, Carlyle and KKR, and one multi-asset, multi-manager model from Franklin Templeton. The announcement comes amid a boom in model portfolio adoption across the RIA universe. As financial advisors increasingly look for model portfolios with private market exposure, both asset managers and various investment platforms are rushing to meet the demand. For example, last week, wealth management platform Envestnet revealed it was adding models with private market exposure options from Fidelity, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. Last year, alternative investment platform iCapital launched its first model portfolio, with access to private equity, private credit and real assets. BlackRock’s models will combine exposure to public and private markets with allocations to public equities, public debt, private equity and private credit through select BlackRock investment vehicles. The assets in the model will run across the risk spectrum. Carlyle’s models will target private equity and private credit, focusing on enhanced returns, supplemental income and capital preservation. Related:RIAs and the Evolving Landscape of Private Wealth KKR’s models will allocate to private equity, private credit, private real estate and private infrastructure. They will also focus on generating income, enhanced returns and capital preservation. Franklin Templeton’s model will invest in private markets, including private credit, private real estate, infrastructure, secondaries, co-investments and asset-backed finance. These investment options will be accessed through Alternatives by Franklin Templeton and select third-party partners. “Alternative investment models give advisors a powerful tool to deliver more personalized portfolios, while helping to streamline operational complexity and scale allocations,” said Neil Blundell, chief investment officer at CAIS Advisors and head of investments at CAIS, in a statement. “By packaging multiple alternative investment strategies into a single, professionally designed solution, advisors can focus more on their clients and less on manager selection.” Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments. She has over 20 years of experience as a business reporter and editor, including for Retail Traffic and National Real Estate Investor magazines.

Title: What’s Next for Real-World Asset Tokenization

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has passed its proof-of-concept phase. With over $20 billion in tokenized assets and institutional momentum from top-tier asset issuers such as Apollo, BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, KKR and VanEck, among others, on-chain finance is no longer hypothetical. But the road ahead — powered by rapid infrastructure improvements and shifting market conditions — is where the real transformation begins. Here are the five key technological and five key market drivers shaping the next three years of tokenization: 1. Blockchain infrastructure maturityLayer 1s and layer 2s are scaling quickly, reducing fees and improving UX. Seamless wallet usage, account abstraction and lower gas costs will make holding tokenized assets frictionless for institutions and individuals alike. 2. Smart contract evolutionContracts are becoming safer, more composable and increasingly automated. Expect AI to assist in designing and auditing contracts that power yield, compliance and asset servicing — all with less manual oversight. 3. On-chain identity integrationWallet-linked KYC and decentralized identity protocols will streamline onboarding without sacrificing privacy, a critical breakthrough for institutional adoption and retail accessibility. 4. Institutional-grade custodyMPC wallets, recovery protocols and regulated custody options will resolve long-standing custody concerns — making tokenized assets truly investable at scale. 5. Regulated marketplaces & exchange integrationMore tokenized assets will trade on SEC-regulated ATS platforms and become available on-chain via compliant DEXs, driving liquidity and transparency across asset classes. 1. Regulatory clarityRegulators in the U.S., EU, and APAC are advancing frameworks for tokenized securities, stablecoins and DeFi. As clarity grows, so will institutional confidence. 2. Tokenized treasuries > stablecoinsTokenized T-bills (e.g. BUIDL, VBILL) are emerging as superior collateral and yield-bearing instruments — offering institutional-grade safety with better capital efficiency. 3. Stablecoins as global settlement layerWith $150B+ in circulation, stablecoins are evolving into programmable cash — enabling instant settlement, treasury funding and FX trades across blockchains. 4. Full asset class coveragePublic equities, private equity, bonds, credit, real estate and commodities are all heading on-chain. Tokenization is expanding from yield products to the full capital stack. 5. Institutional & emerging market accelerationWall Street is actively piloting tokenization infrastructure, while emerging markets are leapfrogging legacy systems by going directly to blockchain rails. Conclusion The next phase of RWA tokenization will be driven by scalability, composability and credibility. Institutions are no longer asking if they should tokenize — but how fast they can do it. The result will be a 24/7, globally accessible financial system — built on trustless rails, powered by programmable assets.

Title: SharpLink Gaming Boosts Crypto Treasury To 188,478 ETH, Becomes Largest Publicly Traded Ether Holder
URL: https://zycrypto.com/sharplink-gaming-boosts-crypto-treasury-to-188478-eth-becomes-largest-publicly-traded-ether-holder/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T14:07:39Z

Minneapolis-based sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming added over $30 million in ETH to its treasury between June 16 and June 20, cementing its position as the largest publicly traded holder of Ether globally. SharpLink acquired 12,207 ETH at an average price of $2,513, boosting its treasury holdings to 188,478 Ether, or approximately $470 million based on the crypto’s price at the time. To fund the purchase, SharpLink raised $27.7 million in net proceeds through its at-the-market (ATM) offering, selling over 2.5 million shares. SharpLink is one of the increasing group of publicly traded companies that recently pivoted to add crypto to their corporate balance sheets, following the successful playbook of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Since the company is centered on Ethereum, it is the first Nasdaq-listed firm to adopt ETH as its core treasury reserve asset, aiming to offer shareholders exposure to the second-largest crypto by market cap. Unlike Strategy, which typically just accumulates BTC, SharpLink has put its ETH to work. Since launching its ETH treasury strategy, the company said it has staked all its crypto cache, earning 120 ETH in rewards. The firm also disclosed an ETH-per-share growth rate of roughly 19% during that period. “This move reflects our confidence in Ethereum’s utility and our commitment to exploring transformative technologies that can unlock new value for our business and stockholders, alike,” said SharpLink Chairman of the Board, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO Joe Lubin in a statement. ETH is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours amid a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. It is now trading at $2,419.38, which is below the average purchase price for SharpLink’s treasury buys. While SharpLink now claims the bragging right of being the biggest publicly traded holder of Ether globally, some entities are still holding more ETH. The Ethereum Foundation now holds 212,072 ETH ( valued at $514.59 million) in its treasury, data from Arkham Intelligence shows. Some crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers, such as BlackRock, also hold a considerably bigger ETH stash, albeit on behalf of their clients. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF held roughly 1.7 million ETH as of June 25, worth around $4 billion.

Title: Agrochemical Giant Syngenta: Toxic Sustainability. Colin Todhunter

Time Published: 2025-06-25T13:28:25Z
Full Content:
Syngenta doesn’t sell sustainability. It sells the story of it. It’s one of the world’s largest agrochemical firms—born from the merger of Novartis and AstraZeneca’s agribusiness arms, now owned by ChemChina. It sells seeds, pesticides and promises. And increasingly, it sells itself as a climate solution. But this is not transformation. It’s rebranding. Syngenta’s model hasn’t changed. It still pushes chemical-intensive farming, proprietary hybrids and monoculture logic. What’s changed is the language: regenerative agriculture, climate smart, sustainable intensification. The poison is the same. Only the label is new. Take paraquat. A highly toxic herbicide linked to thousands of farmer poisonings and deaths across India. Banned in more than 50 countries. Still sold in India. Syngenta is one of its largest manufacturers. In 2020, India’s Ministry of Agriculture proposed banning paraquat, citing health risks and lack of antidote. But the ban never materialised. Industry lobbying, led in part by Syngenta and its affiliates, stalled the process. The company argued that paraquat was safe when used properly. Apparently, training, not prohibition, was the answer. The burden is shifted to the farmer. The chemical stays on the shelf. And the deaths continue. Syngenta now frames itself as a sustainability leader. Its corporate roadmap outlines four priorities: higher yields with lower impact, soil regeneration, rural prosperity and sustainable operations. It speaks of ‘regenerative agriculture’ and ‘nature-positive farming’. It partners with The Nature Conservancy and the World Economic Forum. But its core business remains unchanged. It still sells atrazine, banned in the EU. It still promotes hybrid seeds that require chemical support. It still pushes input-intensive models that degrade soil, reduce biodiversity and lock farmers into cycles of dependency. This is not regeneration. It’s reputation management. And it’s working. In India, Syngenta runs various corporate social responsibility programmes: rural market upgrades, solar electrification, youth training and water access. These projects are real. They improve lives. But they also serve a deeper function: to embed the company in rural communities, deflect criticism and secure social licence. A firm that sells paraquat also installs solar panels. A firm that promotes pesticide use also funds health camps. The contradiction is not resolved. It’s papered over. This is not corporate responsibility. It’s strategic philanthropy. And it’s expanding. The Green Revolution didn’t just change what farmers grew—it changed how they thought about farming. Syngenta’s model continues that legacy. It reframes farming as a chemical equation: inputs in, yields out. Syngenta’s ‘Good Growth Plan’ claims to train millions of farmers in sustainable practices. But these practices often revolve around safe pesticide use—not reducing dependency. The goal is not agroecology. It’s market expansion. And the state plays along. Syngenta partners with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) (India’s top body for agricultural research and education), state governments and international donors. It co-authors training manuals. It sits on advisory boards. It helps shape what counts as ‘best practice’. And it does so without scrutiny. It’s capture by invitation. And it narrows the future. Agroecological alternatives are framed as niche. Indigenous seeds are sidelined. Farmer-led innovation is ignored. The path forward is paved with proprietary inputs, digital compliance and climate branding. The farmer is told ‘adapt or be left behind’. Syngenta sells carbon credits, drought-tolerant hybrids and ‘climate-smart’ packages. It positions itself as part of a solution. But the solution looks a lot like the problem. The same firm that degrades soil now offers soil regeneration. The same firm that promotes monocultures now speaks of biodiversity. The same firm that lobbied against pesticide bans now funds sustainability summits. The future of food is being written by those who caused its crisis. Syngenta doesn’t just sell chemicals. It sells the idea that chemicals are inevitable. That farming without them is naïve. That sustainability means managing toxicity, not moving beyond it. But this is the enclosure of possibility—wrapped in the language of regeneration, delivered through partnerships and enforced by protocol. The agri biotech sector is engaged in a corporate hijack of agriculture while attempting to portray itself as being involved in some kind of service to humanity. A couple of years ago, Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald called for organic farming to be abandoned. He claimed rich countries had to increase their crop production—but organic farming led to lower yields. Fyrwald also called for gene editing to be at the heart of food policy in order to increase food production. He stated that people are starving due to organic agriculture. Writing on the GMWatch website, Jonathan Matthews responded by saying the conflict in Ukraine and food-related supply chain disruptions had emboldened Fyrwald’s scaremongering. In effect, Fyrwald’s comments reflected the industry’s determination to undermine the European Union’s Farm to Fork strategy, which aimed by 2030 not just to slash pesticide use by 50 per cent and fertiliser use by 20 per cent but to more than triple the percentage of EU farmland under organic management. Such goals represent an existential threat to the likes of Syngenta, which led to a carefully orchestrated attack on the EU strategy. Mathews quoted research that shows genetically engineered crops have no yield benefit and drive substantial increases in pesticide use. The newer and much-hyped gene-edited crops look set to do the same. Syngenta was among the corporations criticised by a 2017 UN report for “systematic denial of harms” and “unethical marketing tactics”. Selling highly hazardous pesticides is at the core of Syngenta’s business model. Fyrwald is far from an objective observer. He is compelled to promote corporate value capture, patents and market penetration while denigrating threats to profit margins. Bayer sells dependency, Amazon sells inevitability, Microsoft builds the stack, Gates builds the script, BlackRock governs through capital and so on. Each firm speaks a different dialect. But the grammar is the same. It is the grammar of control. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Joe Duffy will host his final edition of Liveline on Friday, bringing the curtain down on one of the most popular and influential tenures in Irish radio history. Since taking over from the late Marian Finucane as presenter in 1999, Duffy has turned RTÉ Radio 1’s afternoon phone-in show into a phenomenon. Under Duffy’s stewardship, Liveline – with its famous tagline, “Talk to Joe” – could be a safe space for deeply personal stories, a chaotic small claims court and a crusading platform for social justice. As he hangs up his mic on the show, these 10 memorable moments highlight Duffy’s inimitable style, as well as his knack for capturing the public mood. An early indication of Duffy’s ability to stir listeners to action came in January 2001. Helen, a mother of autistic twins, phoned the show “in pure desperation” to describe her dire living conditions: her Wicklow house had been left unfinished by a builder who had scarpered, despite having been paid £25,000. “It’s just a nightmare,” she said, recounting how she had to cook Christmas dinner in her garage. Duffy appealed for help, the show was duly inundated with offers from tradesmen, and 101 days later, Helen – real name Catherine Doyle – was hosting both Duffy and President Mary McAleese in her newly rebuilt home. The legend of the Liveline effect was born. In hindsight, Duffy’s first decade at Liveline was wilder and more sensationalist than in later years, never more so than during the 2007 on-air barney between crime journalist Paul Williams and criminal Alan Bradley. The temperature really spiked when Duffy took a call from John Daly, an inmate at Portlaoise Prison, who accused Williams of stirring up a feud between himself and fellow Finglas native Bradley. “I can’t stay long, I’m in a cell,” said an agitated Daly. “Get off the phone you f***ing liar.” The episode prompted a clampdown on mobile phones in Irish jails. But it had a grim coda: Daly was murdered a few months after being released from prison. One of Liveline’s enduring strengths has been as a consumer watchdog, calling out shoddy customer service or – in the case of Mark Townley – serial conmen. In June 2008, Duffy heard several complaints about a Dublin-based model agency approaching teenage girls with bogus promises of a spot on an Irish version of reality show America’s Next Top Model – for a fee, naturally. Bangor native Townley, the agency’s boss, phoned in and brazenly defended his scam, while Duffy picked apart his guest’s murky past, before delivering a dramatic coup de grace: “I’m putting it to you straight now, and you can take me to the High Court on this – you are the Mark Townley that has been banned from entering England and Wales for two years.” Townley never sued: in a tragicomic twist, he was later imprisoned in England for threatening to kill Prince Harry. In September 2008, with the Celtic Tiger faltering, Liveline was flooded with calls from people anxiously withdrawing their money from banks and placing it in supposedly safer post office accounts: a postmaster spoke of queues out the door. Duffy knew reassurances from banks were falling on deaf ears: “Look at Lehman Brothers, look at Enron, Rusnak and AIB – the issue is trust,” he said, modestly adding, “I know I sound like Jimmy Stewart in It’s a Wonderful Life.” Then finance minister Brian Lenihan was so worried about Duffy’s potential to cause a run on the banks that he phoned RTÉ’s director-general Cathal Goan to complain. Days later, however, Lenihan issued the fateful bank guarantee, thus heralding Ireland’s great economic crash – something Duffy cannot be blamed for. But the host displayed his occasionally preternatural facility for taking the public pulse; as he later remarked, “The punters knew the banks were dodgy before the politicians did.” Down the years, Duffy has had many heartbreaking conversations with people suffering from grave medical conditions, from cancer patient Susie Long in the months before her passing in 2007, to the late Charlie Bird’s revelation of his motor neuron disease diagnosis in 2021. But few interviews had the immense empirical impact of Duffy’s 2009 interview with screenwriter Frank Deasy. A friend of the host, Deasy candidly spoke of his agonising wait for a liver transplant, likening it to “being on death row”. It was a sadly prophetic description: Deasy died only days later, during an operation to transplant his liver. But the effect of his brave account was spectacular. Within days, 15,000 people had applied for organ donor cards, with surely life-saving results. Once Duffy has a target in his sights, he can be relentless. This was certainly the case in 2010, when the host spearheaded a campaign against head shops selling so-called “legal highs”. For days on end, Duffy heard from people whose family members had suffered terrible effects after consuming psychoactive substances from the 100 stores across the country. One caller, Paul Hodkinson, recounted how his brother Colm died after taking magic mushrooms in 2005. Duffy’s unremitting campaign whipped up emotions, though not always to edifying effect, with pickets placed on some shops. But the public pressure yielded action. The government clamped down on the sale of legal highs, leading in turn to the closure of most head shops. A decade later, Duffy commented: “Our campaign to close down head shops was our best achievement.” Arguably Duffy’s most significant achievement, however, is his uncompromising and compassionate coverage of clerical abuse in Ireland. Following the 2009 publication of the Ryan and Murphy reports into sexual abuse in Catholic-run institutions, Duffy provided a sympathetic space for survivors to share their stories in raw, unfiltered fashion. In other hands, the deluge of abusive experiences could have been numbing, but Duffy handled the issue sensitively, with callers testifying to the traumas endured by vulnerable people in the Church’s care. Taking just one example, a caller named Maureen later recalled the harsh regime she endured in a Magdalene laundry, as well as the harrowing fate of her older brother at Artane Industrial School: “He was rented out to a bank manager for weekends.” Duffy has revisited the subject regularly ever since, whether allowing survivors to furiously decry the inadequacy of the mother and baby homes report in 2021, or, the following year, hearing how schoolboys sexually assaulted by priests at Blackrock College in the 1970s were shamed into silence by their clerical abusers: “They make you feel so ashamed, so guilty, it’s actually frightening.” In allowing survivors to find their voice, Duffy helped reveal the truth about one of Ireland’s most shameful chapters. A proud son of Ballyfermot, Duffy has never hidden his Dublin roots, given to sentimentally reminiscing with older callers about the city in the rare auld times. Equally, however, he has fulminated against the capital’s less attractive side, be it antisocial behaviour, street crime or, during an unforgettable 2015 rant, the city itself. Duffy declared Dublin “dead”, with shuttered landmark stores replaced by pound shops and fast food joints. “Dublin city centre is turning into an unadulterated kip, and nobody is shouting stop.” The possibility of such cranky outbursts ensured Liveline remained appointment radio for many throughout Duffy’s tenure. At the height of the first Covid lockdown in April 2020, between his signature pandemic-era exhortations to “washyourhands”, Duffy brought much-needed gaiety to the nation by hosting a riotous discussion on the TV series Normal People, complete with the classic Liveline elements of sex and religion. The host first heard genteel-sounding caller Mary voice her displeasure at the sexually explicit scenes in the small screen adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel. “I imagine it was like something you would expect to see in a porno movie,” Mary ventured. “What would you see in a porno movie, Mary?” replied Duffy, deploying his trademark sigh. (Mary didn’t know.) [ Normal People: Putting Sally Rooney’s novel on the small screenOpens in new window ] From there on, proceedings grew more entertainingly fractious, as a devout Christian named Tommy started railing against “fornication”, “the teaching of promiscuity” and, most unfortunately, “sluts”. The derogatory terminology aside, the captive audience was treated to a vintage episode. He can be hammy, tetchy and mawkish, as well as empathetic and engaging, but if Duffy has one defining characteristic as a broadcaster, it’s his capacity to hit upon and tease out the urgent conversations bubbling under the surface of Irish life. This was evident in May 2021 when the host spoke to Sallyanne Brady, who described the multitude of distressing effects of menopause on her health. Despite the fact that half the population will face menopause, Brady said, there was a silence on the matter: “I want a voice for these women.” Duffy soon noted that “the calls are coming in thick and fast”, and over the next two weeks women phoned in to share their experiences of menopause. Not for the first time, Duffy put a previously taboo subject firmly on the public agenda. That a male presenter should facilitate such a necessary conversation on women’s health probably says something about Irish society; but equally, Duffy was always adept at tapping into his audience’s concerns. People talked to Joe, after all. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

More is displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, showcasing Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's real-time financial trends, stock price movements, market fluctuations, and developments in the global financial services and investment management sectors, on April 6, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) The custodial banking behemoth Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) is considering a possible acquisition of Northern Trust, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. So, will a deal actually occur? Not at the moment. The CEOs of both companies have had discussions, but there has yet to be a formal proposal. A spokesperson for Northern Trust also stated that the company prefers to remain independent. However, should the two firms join forces, there are numerous potential advantages due to their significant presence in the asset-servicing arena; thus, the opportunity isn’t entirely closed, particularly if BNY presents a persuasive proposal. So why would this deal be advantageous for BNY? For BNY, the rationale is quite straightforward: larger scale, increased influence, and substantial cost efficiencies. Both companies provide comparable services such as asset protection, trade settlement, cash management, and wealth as well as asset management services. Merging with Northern Trust would produce an investment services powerhouse. BNY currently oversees $53 trillion in assets under custody, ranking as the world’s largest custodial bank. Collaborating with Northern Trust’s clientele and capabilities would significantly enhance the strength of the combined organization. The merged entity would control over $3 trillion in assets under management, enabling it to compete with asset-management titans like BlackRock and Vanguard. Additionally, there’s an efficiency component to consider. The merger could yield considerable cost synergies primarily through the consolidation of technological platforms, reducing overall workforce numbers, and minimizing redundant real estate holdings. Under the leadership of CEO Robin Vince, who has implemented a turnaround strategy that has boosted the company’s stock by almost 50% within the last year, BNY appears well-positioned to pursue this course. Furthermore, BNY’s financial performance has recently exceeded expectations. related: Is Neobank Chime Stock A Buy? Initially, Northern Trust must consent to a sale. After the initial report surfaced, the company asserted its commitment to remaining independent. Then there’s the matter of regulation. While the Trump administration is perceived as more welcoming to substantial mergers in the financial services sector, especially following the recent approval of the Discover-Capital One merger, BNY is recognized as a globally systemic bank, which may invite additional regulatory scrutiny. The leading positions of both companies in the custodian and asset servicing domains could also trigger antitrust issues. Shares of Bank of New York experienced a fall of about 2% during Monday’s trading session, suggesting that investors might not be entirely convinced about a potential deal. Investing in a singular stock involves inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 during the past 4 years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, demonstrating less volatility as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Bitfinex Securities Is Taking a Different Approach to RWAs, Launches Two New Products in the U.K.

These days, the mention of blockchain-based real world assets (RWAs) conjures up traditional finance institutions, like BlackRock, presiding over billions of dollars in tokenized money market funds. But the original promise of crypto was about opening up finance opportunities to anyone. That’s the ethos Bitfinex Securities is sticking to with its latest tokenized equity issuances: two alternative finance products in the UK, one focused on community banking debt, the other on litigation relating to mis-sold car finance claims. Announced on Wednesday, Bitfinex Securities’ “TITAN1” product will allocate 5 million british pounds ($6.8 million) into subordinate debt issued by Castle Community Bank, a firm supporting loans to financially excluded customers in Edinburgh, Scotland. This alternative debt product will provide investors with a 20% dividend per annum (net of fees), which will be paid quarterly for up to 10 years, with non-callable provisions for the first 5 years, according to a press release. The second structure, “TITAN2,” will invest 100 million british pounds ($136 million) into litigation financing related to car finance mis-selling claims in the UK, a market expected to generate billions in compensation. Funds will be deployed through equity-linked notes and Investors will receive a 50% share of the claims recovery proceeds split proportionately among investors, Bitfinex Securities said. Both listings will be accessible to investors as tradable tokens via Bitfinex Securities’ secondary market. The tokens have been issued on the Liquid Network, a side chain of Bitcoin developed by technology firm Blockstream, where transfers require issuer authorization, with a whitelist system ensuring compliance standards and jurisdictional requirements. Looking back in time, Bitfinex Securities’ foray into tokenized RWAs pre-dates by some years the current trend for blockchain-based financial assets issued by institutions like BlackRock or Franklin Templeton. The firm started out with niche products like a tokenized bitcoin mining hashrate contract linked to Blockstream, followed by a number of bond issuances, including the first tokenized U.S. Treasuries offering in the nascent crypto hub of El Salvador, bringing T-Bill investments to individuals and organizations who were previously unable to access these products. Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, takes a philosophical view of the current tokenization trend. “We want to be able to help people bridge that gap to investors,” Knutson said in an interview. “Whether it's a company or a bond issuance, or whatever it is, to raise capital and kind of fill that gap that's left by banks in many parts of the world that just aren't willing to lend, or where people struggle to get access to capital.” Fresh off a digital assets panel in London alongside BlackRock and UK asset manager Schroders, Knutson said there’s something of a bias in the ecosystem towards fixed income. Most of the focus is around money market funds, where people tend to buy and hold to get a yield, so there's just not a lot of trading, he said. “A big part of this is about disintermediation, and I think that’s something the institutional guys don't quite get,” Knutson said. “When you look at the details of what they've actually done, it's typically left hand to right hand. It's the same kind of people. It's going through depositories, it's going through transfer payment agents, all of the normal kind of parts of the traditional ecosystem, which I don't think are technologically probably necessary.” Read more: How the Next Wave of RWAs is Becoming Crypto’s Real Edge Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Title: Leaving Cert grinds industry: ‘Salaries scales for the top teachers can be 100 to 250 grand’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/06/25/leaving-cert-grinds-industry-salaries-for-the-top-teachers-are-100-to-250-grand/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
The final Leaving Cert exams are over – but another competition has been raging among grind schools where top teachers have been snapped for eye-watering salaries. The race is for a slice of a grinds industry estimated to be worth up to €60-80 million. Grinds360 is the newest competitor on the market, which raised more than €3 million from investors who include former and present rugby players such as Brian O’Driscoll, Caelan Doris and Jordan Larmour. It describes itself as a “hybrid” service, combining an app which streams weekly grinds across 20 subjects, a Netflix-style catalogue of video lessons as well as in-person workshops at certain times of year. The cost, which has varied since its launch almost a year ago, is currently €1,399 a year. The company started out by poaching several teachers from rivals such as the Institute of Education and the smaller Dublin Academy of Education on huge salaries for the sector. The circumstances of one those cases – maths teacher Rob Browne, who left the Dublin Academy of Education to work for Grinds360 – was at the centre of a High Court row last September, which was subsequently struck out. Brendan Kavanagh, chairman and co-founder of Grinds360, says the firm started out hiring teachers from its competitors for key subjects like maths, English, Irish, sciences and business. The going rate to attract some of the top talen from its rivals initially was, he says, “anywhere from 100 to 250 grand”. “Are they worth 200 grand or 250 grand? For the hours they had to work – they were working six, seven days a week in day school and night school – I’d want that kind of money – especially for teaching!” Kavanagh laughs. At the online platform, he says, they are able to work fewer hours but play key roles in developing the future of the company. “It’s not really apples for apples. The more experienced grinds teachers are able to add a lot of value as we train other teachers throughout the country [who are now working for the company].” Some, he says, were also attracted by the idea of becoming involved in ownership of the firm. “If you earn that kind of money, you pay a lot of tax. So I think the opportunity for them to become stakeholders in the business ... created a new sort of environment there.” Subsequent teachers have been hired part-time, on different contracts, from various schools in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Roscommon. The result, he maintains, is that the company is making grinds “accessible and affordable” for students, while disrupting the “superstar teacher” narrative which he says has been pushed by some grind schools. “I’m off a few Christmas Card lists and I’ve been referred to as the Michael O’Leary of grinds. I’ll take it if making overpriced, over-glorified education finally compete on fairness, access, and transparency earns me that comparison,” he says. Nearly one year on from launch, Kavanagh says Grinds360 has seen “explosive growth” with more than 3,000 paying members and 18,000 app users. Backed by a €3.2 million seed round, he says the company is set to “double revenue” in 2025-2026 and claims the company has established itself as the “go-to alternative to traditional grind schools”. “The numbers speak for themselves – there’s a real hunger for a new model of academic support,” he says. Yet, business is also booming at the Institute of Education on Dublin’s Leeson Street, which itself was a disruptive force in the education sector 57 years ago when it started the trend for exam-focused tuition. The institute was sold to a UK-based schools group, Dukes Education, in 2023 for just under €135 million. This year, the institute is forecasting a record enrolment of 1,700 full-time students in September across fourth, fifth and sixth year, with students paying annual fees of up to €11,000 a year. It also runs grinds, crash courses and online learning for up to 10,000 students attending other schools. Yvonne O’Toole says demand is growing not just for exam results but because students have “moved on” from single-sex, religious schools and uniforms by the time they are in senior cycle. While it lost some teachers to Grinds360, she says “crazy salaries” are not the norm, but that teachers are paid well on the basis that they are “expected to go above and beyond”. “They do a lot more hours ... there are extra classes – morning, evening – and they’re expected to be available. They put their heart and soul into it.” The institute’s main competitor, the Dublin Academy of Education in Stillorgan, south Dublin, is also running at capacity. It had about 350 full-time fifth- and sixth-year students last year and says it is on course to grow to 400 when it moves to a larger premises in Blackrock in September. It expects numbers to grow to 500 in 2027 when it launches a fourth year offering. Founder Chris Lauder says while it also lost some teachers to Grinds360, it has “a deep squad” and was able to “march on”. The academy, he says, is always looking for top teaching talent. “What we used to do was ask our students if they knew of great teachers and surveyed them. Teachers also know other great teachers. And, these days, you also find them on social media,” he says. He questions whether some of the top salaries being mentioned are sustainable for the sector and insists the best teachers ultimately want to teach students in-person rather than online. “We pay more than what the public sector has to offer, and in some cases a lot more – maybe 50 per cent more,” he says. “Our teachers want to work for not just for remuneration; they like teaching students who are serious about academics. This is senior cycle only. They’re young adults, not children. They are driven – and they are a joy to teach.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Carl O'Brien is Education Editor of The Irish Times.

Four technocrats who are closely affiliated with Meta, Palantir, and OpenAI were just commissioned into the U.S. Army as lieutenant colonels, which I find to be extremely odd, and seriously concerning. Here’s the story, from a report at Task & Purpose: Four senior executives of tech giants like Meta and Palantir are being sworn into the Army Reserve as direct-commissioned officers at the unusually high rank of lieutenant colonel as part of a new program to recruit private-sector experts to speed up tech adoption. For context, these Silicon Valley executives just skipped the entire enlisted rank structure (12 ascending positions), and four officer ranks, and jumped right to O-5. And, here are the four names: The Reserve’s new lieutenant colonels are Shyam Sankar, chief technology officer for Palantir; Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta; Kevin Weil, chief product officer of OpenAI; and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab and former chief research officer for OpenAI. Since my mind immediately goes to scandal and conspiracy when I see the federal government cozying up to Big Tech (I’m engrossed in the news every day, can you blame me?), I quizzed a military friend trying to understand any reason why this might not be the nightmare it seems, wondering if I were overlooking or missing something. His conclusion was logical and simple: the only reason people are commissioned into the military is because they want to work within the military framework. I asked if it was because maybe their civilian status precludes them from being involved in sensitive tasks or missions? He replied no, noting that civilian consultants are a normal thing in the military, and then referenced Hillary Clinton who “never served a day in her life” but held a Top Secret SCI until very recently, when President Trump revoked it. And, these four men aren’t going to be officers in the traditional sense, as they’re exempt from standard military requirements: As Task & Purpose notes, the men will get to skip the usual process of taking a Direct Commissioning Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, and they won’t need to complete the Army Fitness Test. So, why are top executives in Big Tech joining the military? Especially alarming is that all three tech firms, largely owned by BlackRock and Vanguard, are known for being enemies to liberty and freedom. (I wrote on a disturbing development regarding Palantir here.) At least two of these technocrats are World Economic Forum elites—and now they’re leaders in our military? Is Sankar just a surrogate for Palantir’s Alex Karp? This doesn’t sit right with me at all. Image from Grok.

Total: 0.31 times (BSE data as at 3.54 pm) The credit growth of NBFCs which has trended above India’s GDP growth historically, is expected to continue to rise at a faster pace. NBFCs have shown remarkable resilience and gained importance in the financial sector ecosystem, growing from less than Rs 2 trillion AUM at the turn of the century to Rs 48 trillion at the end of FY25. NBFCs AUM as of FY19 was approximately Rs 23 trillion which grew at a 6-year CAGR of 13.2% to Rs 48 trillion as of FY25. Rapid revival in the economy is expected to drive consumer demand on FY26, leading to healthy growth in NBFCs. The NBFC credit is expected to grow at 15-17% between FY 25 and FY 28, driven by growth across retail, MSME and corporate segments continuing to be the primary drivers. HDB Financial Services Limited being one of the leading and the fastest growing NBFC is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities within the sector and the company aims to diversify and expand addressable customer segments by widening and enhancing product offering and continue to expand pan-India omni-channel distribution network. Investors looking to invest can invest in the IPO for the long term. - Master Capital Services Ltd With scalable operations, granular customer acquisition, diversified funding, and expanding fee-based revenues, HDB is expected to sustain its growth momentum, outperform the sector, and continue delivering healthy, sustainable returns. We recommend to subscribe to the issue as a good long term investment as the company aligns with the aggressive mindset of the parent and improvement in npa levels that have seen recent deterioration while the CAR levels post issue are adequate for the next 12-18 months. SMIFS Sensex ended 700.40 pts or 0.85% higher at 82,755.51 and Nifty 50 settled at 25,244.75, up by 200.40 pts or 0.8%. We expect that its AUM and disbursement will witness higher growth compared to FY25, led by higher urban and rural consumer demand driven by government’s intervention in reducing income tax rates, RBI’s efficient inflation management and expected cuts in GST rates for the overall consumption basket. HDB’s initial issue is priced at 3.4x TTM P/B (considered equity raise for calculating TTM BV) compared to the peer average of 4.4x TTM P/B. We believe the issue is attractively priced considering its parentage, peer group ROA average and its growth potential. We assign a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to the initial issue of the HDB Financial Services. - Deven Choksey Research Key risks, according to Canara Bank Securities, include a high cost-to-income ratio (42%) and 27% unsecured loan exposure, though mitigated by data-driven underwriting. Despite valuation concerns, HDB’s strong brand, stable financials, rural reach, and niche positioning offer long-term potential for medium-to-long-term investor HDBFSL has reported a steady topline CAGR of 14.6% between FY23 and FY25. On the return front, HBDFSL has reported ROA at 2.1% in FY25 (vs 2.7% in FY24), while ROE declined from 17.9% in FY24 to 14.6% in FY25. GNPA and NNPA both increased from 1.9% and 0.6% in FY24 to 2.3% and 1.0% in FY25, respectively, as a result of slippages and write-offs during the fiscal. Despite the relatively lower return ratios and profitability growth, we remain optimistic of the company’s longer -term growth trend supported by a strong brand parentage, diversified liability franchise supported by a strong credit rating of AAA and a pan-India presence. The issue is valued at a P/B ratio of 3.9x at the upper price band based on FY25 book value, which we believe to be fairly valued compared to its peers. Considering the above compelling factors, we recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating to this issue from a long term perspective. - BP WEALTH HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.28 times as at 3.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.28 times (BSE data as at 3.03 pm) HDBFS, a fast-growing subsidiary of HDFC Bank, is set for a ₹12,500cr IPO with a valuation of ~₹61,253cr at 3.9x P/B basis FY25 book value. Its strong presence in semi-urban and underbanked markets, diversified and expanding loan portfolio, advanced digital capabilities, and robust financial performance underscore its compelling long-term investment potential. - Aditya Birla Money Backed by strong parentage, AAA-rated credit profile, and an expanding footprint, A C Choksi Share Brokers Pvt. Ltd. says HDB is positioned to leverage growth in underserved segments. However, challenges around rising NPAs, elevated credit costs, and subdued ROEs remain near-term watchpoints. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.24 times as at 2.21 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.24 times (BSE data as at 2.21 pm) Valuation: The company is valued at an FY25 P/B of 3.2x/3.4x at post\u0002issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively. The company is backed by strong parentage, brand, governance, risk management and a high credit rating. It is one of the largest NBFCs catering to the 2 nd largest customer franchise. The company is well placed to register healthy growth going ahead, while witnessing an improvement in the asset quality. SBI Securities recommend investors SUBSCRIBE to the issue at the cut-off price. At the upper end of the price band, HDB is valued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.01x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.72x. This places it above peers like L&amp;T Finance and Mahindra Finance, and in line with Sundaram Finance and Cholamandalam, but below the premium commanded by Bajaj Finance. - Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk • Further stake sale by parent HDFC Bank can be overhang on the stock price: The parent HDFC Bank may have to decrease its holding from 74.2% (post-issue @ UB) to less than 20% in a span of 2 years, according to the draft circular by the RBI, which was issued on 4th October 24. • Asset quality risk: The company’s Gross Stage 3 Loans accounted for 2.3% of the gross loans as of Mar’25, which may adversely affect the company’s financials in case of non-payment or default. • Unsecured loan risk: Unsecured loans accounted for 27.0% of the company’s gross loans as of Mar’25. • Liquidity risk: Any asset-liability mismatch may cause liquidity concerns affecting the results of operations and financial condition • Regulatory risk: The NBFC industry is highly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, and any adverse regulations or any failure to comply with a regulation may have an adverse impact on the business. - SBI Securities All IT stocks traded in green, led by Mphasis, LTIMindtree, Infosys. Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech. Among the defence index, Dynamatic Technologies and Cyient DLM traded with 1-3 per cent gains, while Data Patterns, GRSE, Paras Defence, BEL and Mazagon Dock depreciated 2-4 per cent.

HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.20 times as at 1.27 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.20 times (BSE data as at 1.27 pm) We believe HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in one of India’s leading and fastest-growing diversified NBFCs, with a well-balanced loan portfolio across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance. We think as it is backed by the brand strength and operational discipline of its promoter, HDFC Bank, HDB has demonstrated consistent growth, strong underwriting capabilities, and resilient asset quality— evidenced by its low GNPA and NNPA ratios. We also think with over 19 million customers, a granular loan book, and a robust phygital distribution network of 1,771 branches and 140,000+ retail touchpoints, the company is well positioned to capture underpenetrated credit demand, particularly among “new to credit” borrowers. By looking at the financials, the company has demonstrated a a revenue growth of 14.3% in FY2024 and 15% in FY2025, with net profit rising by 25.6% in FY2024, though witnessing a modest decline of 11.6% in FY2025, mainly on account of two- fold increase in provision. On valuation parse at the upper price band of ₹740/-, the issue is asking a market cap of ₹ 61,388 cr. Based on FY 2025 earnings and fully diluted post-IPO paid up capital, the company is asking for Price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.5x which seems fairly valued looking at its industry average ~3.5-4x. Given its strong parentage, proven execution across cycles, diversified loan mix, and digital-first approach, we believe HDB Financial Services is well positioned to benefit from India’s ongoing financial inclusion and expanding retail credit demand. Hence, looking at all attributes we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the HDB Financial Services Ltd IPO for long term perspective. Mehta Equities HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.17 times as at 12.42 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.17 times (BSE data as at 12.42 pm) We compare HDB with Bajaj Finance and also with other vehicle, MSME, Consumer financiers like Chola, M&M Finance, Shriram Finance and L&T Finance. HDB’s asset quality is superior to peers on the back of its strong ownership and management pedigree. Its loan growth has been in line with peers over last 3 years. However we note that owing to HDB’s prudent focus on quality of customers, it earns a lower spread vis-à-vis peers. Also HDB’s operational cost is elevated. Thus HDB has managed to deliver ROA in the range of between 2 to 3% over last 3 years with FY25 post IPO ROA of 2.0%. This is below the peer average of 3.2% and Bajaj Finance’s 5.0% witnessed in FY25. Although we believe that HDB should be valued at a substantial discount to Bajaj Finance, its superior parentage and asset quality performance lead us to believe that it is attractively valued from a long term perspective upon comparing with Chola which has ROA of 2.4% and is being valued at 5.5x FY25 compared to HDB’s 3.4x (post IPO). Also HDB’s valuation is in line with the peer average which provides us comfort. Therefore, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue, with a Long-term POSITIVE outlook Nirmal Bang Timing the Tide: Cyclical Sweet Spot or Regulatory Compulsion? The IPO’s June launch coincides with a Goldilocks period for NBFCs – credit growth remains robust at 15%+, asset quality metrics have normalized post-pandemic, and risk appetite is returning to rural markets. However, beneath these favorable conditions lurk structural challenges: rising cost of funds (HDB’s NIMs compressed 30 bps in FY24), increasing competition from new-age fintechs, and the perennial volatility of unsecured lending (27% of HDB’s portfolio). HDFC Bank’s decision to monetize part of its 94% stake through a ₹10,000 crore OFS while retaining 74% ownership suggests cautious optimism – they’re taking money off the table but maintaining skin in the game. The fresh ₹2,500 crore capital infusion will strengthen HDB’s tier-1 capital adequacy (currently at 16.8%), providing ammunition to chase growth while maintaining healthy buffers. For investors, the key consideration isn’t whether HDB is a good company (its 2.26% GNPA and 23% CAGR loan book growth confirm it is), but whether it can translate its HDFC lineage and pan-India presence into superior returns in a maturing market. In many ways, HDB’s IPO represents the NBFC sector’s transition from its “wild west” days to a more regulated, institutional phase. Its performance post-listing will reveal much about public market appetite for steady, diversified lenders in an environment where specialists often steal the spotlight. The company’s fate won’t just belong to its shareholders, but will serve as a barometer for the entire NBFC sector’s next chapter. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says IPO-bound non-banking finance company (NBFC) HDB Financial Services does not get or give any business leads to HDFC Bank or share any office space with the latter, and is not reliant on its parent for operational purposes, MD & CEO G Ramesh, told businessline in an interaction. “We originate our business ourselves, we don’t get any leads from any of our promoter companies. We underwrite our own business, and operate 1,771 branches of HDB Financial Services. They are our own branches and there is no shared space with HDFC Bank. And our technology stack is different than the bank, which makes our business independent,” he said. His comments come in the backdrop of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 2024 draft norms which state that only a single entity within a bank group can undertake a particular form of permissible business. Report by Piyush Shukla of businessline | Read more HDB Financial Services, an IPO-bound NBFC, operates independently from HDFC Bank, with an upcoming IPO on June 25. HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.14 times as at 12.03 pm on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.14 times (BSE data as at 12.03 pm) HDB’s IPO crystallises three critical trends in Indian finance. First, it underscores the RBI’s push to bring systemically important NBFCs (like HDB, classified in the “upper layer”) under greater market discipline through public listings. Second, it highlights how banks are reluctantly reducing stakes in lucrative NBFC subsidiaries ahead of anticipated ownership caps. Third, and most importantly, the offering serves as a referendum on whether generalist NBFCs can command premium valuations in a market that increasingly rewards niche lenders. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come At upper price band, IPO is priced at 3.2x FY25 P/BV post capital raise (V/s its close peer Chola Fin-5.5x) with 2.2% ROA. We recommend SUBSCRIBE for long term. Key risk: Regulatory overhang on overlap of business activities with the parent. - IDBI Capital The ₹12,500 crore HDB Financial Services IPO marks a pivotal moment for India’s NBFC sector – not just as the largest NBFC debut to date, but as a test case for how public markets value diversified lenders in an era of tightening regulations and evolving credit demand. Coming at a time when RBI is pushing large NBFCs toward listing (with a September 2025 deadline), this IPO represents both a regulatory compliance exercise and a strategic coming-of-age for HDFC Bank’s 17-year-old shadow lending arm. The timing is telling: with credit growth outpacing GDP expansion and NBFCs capturing 40% of new retail loans, HDB’s public listing offers a calibrated entry point into India’s formalisation of credit. - Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow Securities, says Stay tuned. More to come HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.12 times as at 11.36 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.12 times (BSE data as at 11.36 am) We recommend to subscribe this IPO with long term view, as With its robust brand, varied loan portfolio, and wide distribution network, the company which is supported by HDFC Bank offers a great chance. With a focus on digital infrastructure and underbanked segments, it is well-positioned for long-term growth. Considering the company’s constant growth in its headline numbers and the recent rate cut by the RBI will improve liquidity and reduces borrowing costs, which will benefits the company. - Kunvarji Wealth Solutions JM Financial, BNP Paribas, BofA Securities India, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt Ltd, IIFL Securities, Jefferies India, Morgan Stanley India Company, Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, Nuvama Wealth Management, and UBS Securities India are managing the company’s IPO.

The anchor round saw participation from a host of investors such as domestic mutual funds, insurance companies, and foreign entities, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website on Tuesday. Life Insurance Corporation of India, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI MF, Nippon India MF, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, BlackRock, Royal Bank of Canada, Allianz Global Investors, Morgan Stanley, Prudential plc, Copthall Mauritius Investment, APG Asset Management, Baillie Gifford, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, and Goldman Sachs have participated in the anchor round. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, British multinational Schroder, Fidelity Investments, Societe Generale, and Tata Investment Corporation, among others, have also been allotted shares in the anchor round. According to the circular, HDB Financial Services has allotted over 4.55 crore equity shares to 141 entities at Rs 740 per equity share, which is the upper end of the IPO price band, aggregating the transaction size to Rs 3,368.99 crore. Of the total equity share allocation to the anchor investors, the company has allocated nearly 1.94 crore shares to 22 domestic mutual funds that have applied for the public issue through 65 schemes, the circular said. PTI “HDB Financial Services Ltd. is India’s second largest and third-fastestgrowing NBFC franchise, serving 19.2 million customers as of March 31, 2025, with a CAGR of 25.45% over two years. Its growth is supported by financial inclusion initiatives, and it offers 13 lending products across Enterprise Lending, Asset Finance, and Consumer Finance, tailored by loan type, customer profile, tenure, and interest rate. They have built a pan-India hybrid presence, comprising over 1,771 physical branches across more than 1,170 towns and cities in 31 States and Union Territories as of March 31, 2025, supported by a digitally enabled distribution network through both in-house and third-party channels. They intend to further diversify their funding sources by expanding and strengthening their lender base, with the goal of optimising leverage and reducing the average cost of borrowings. At the upper price band, the company’s FY25 price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 3.7x, with a post-issue market capitalization of ₹6,13,879.4 million. Backed by the strong parentage of HDFC Bank, India’s second largest private bank by total assets, the company offers a well-diversified product portfolio with robust granularity, scale, and sound lending quality. We consider the IPO fairly valued and recommend a “SUBSCRIBE” rating.” Anand Rathi HDB Financial Limited has been subscribed 0.08 times as at 10.48 am on June 25, 2025. Total: 0.08 times (BSE data as at 10.48 am) HDB Financial Limited IPO: We recommend a SUBSCRIBE rating to the issue, supported by: 1) A robust brand franchise and granular retail lending model, 2) A wide-reaching Omni-channel (phygital) distribution platform, and 3) Access to low-cost funding anchored by a AAA-rated credit profile. - Centrum Broking Sharekhan IPO report mentions, HDB Financial Services is valued at an FY25 price-to-book ratio of ~3.2x/~3.4x at post-issue capital at the lower price band & upper price band respectively, which is reasonable as compared to its peers considering the growth and return ratio profile. “Strong parentage and much smaller in size as compared its core peer (Bajaj Finance) provides a long runway for growth. Additionally, favourable macro environment will act as tailwind for the sector in the near to medium term. We expect healthy listing gains and remain assertive from a medium to long-term perspective.” ❑ Asset Quality: High exposure to unsecured loans and MSMEs increases the risk of defaults, especially during economic stress. ❑ Geographic Concentration: Over 80% of branches are in semi-urban/rural areas, which may be more vulnerable to economic or monsoon-related disruptions. ❑ Liquidity & Interest Rate Risk: As an NBFC, HDB relies on borrowed funds. Tightening liquidity or rising interest rates could impact margins and loan growth. ❑ Regulatory Risk: RBI’s evolving norms for NBFCs could affect operations, compliance costs, and capital requirements. ❑ Competition: Intense competition from banks, fintechs, and other NBFCs may pressure yields and affect credit quality. ❑ Limited Transparency: Being unlisted, HDB provides less public disclosure than listed peers, limiting investor visibility HDB Financial Services IPO has been subscribed 0.04 times as at 10.18 am on June 25, its opening day. The NII portion has been booked 0.07 times, retail 0.05 times, employee portion 0.29 times and reserved for shareholders 0.07 times. QIBs were NIL. Influx Healthtech stock traded flat on NSE Emerge at ₹132.20 as at 10.11 am after listing at ₹132.50, a premium of 38% against the issue price of ₹96. Arisinfra Solutions stock rose 1.55% on the NSE to ₹208.18 as at 10.09 am after listing at ₹205, a 7.65% discount from the IPO price of ₹222. Valuation: HFSL is the seventh largest leading, diversified retail-focused NBFC in India in terms of the size of total gross loan. The company is categorized as an Upper layer NBFC (NBFC-UL) by RBI. Its lending products are offered through three business verticals which is Enterprise lending (39.3%), Asset lending (38%) and consumer finance (22.7%). The company’s loan book comprises 73% secured loans and 27% unsecured loans, with its customer base primarily consisting of salaried individuals, self-employed professionals, and business owners. GNPA stood at 2.3% and NNPA at 1% for FY25. At the higher price band, the issue is valued at a P/BV of 3.4x (based on post-issue BVPS), which is in line with the peer average, making the issue appear fully priced. While the company has delivered steady growth in interest income driven by the expansion of its gross loan book, profitability has been impacted by interest rate volatility, leading to a decline in PAT for FY25. Additionally, the NIM has been under pressure and remains lower compared to peers. The declining ROE and PCR further underscore operational concerns. Although the company is well-positioned for long-term growth, supported by its strong brand and expanding customer base, considering the near-term operational challenges, we recommend a “Subscribe For Long Term” rating for this issue -Choice Broking India’s largest NBFC public issue, HDB Financial Services, will hit the primary market today at a price band ₹700-740 a share.

Title: Spot Ethereum ETFs record $1B inflows in 15 trading days, hitting $4B for the first time

BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.3 billion of gross inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the US crossed $4 billion in cumulative net inflows on June 23, only eleven months after their market debut. The products launched on July 23, 2024, and required 216 US trading sessions to accumulate their first $3 billion by May 30. Following the $3 billion mark, spot Ethereum ETFs added the next $1 billion in just 15 trading days, lifting lifetime net subscriptions to $4.01 billion by the close of June 23. Those 15 sessions represent 6.5% of the 231-day trading history but account for 25% of all cash committed so far. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drove the expansion with $5.31 billion of gross inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH contributed $1.65 billion and Bitwise’s ETHW added $346 million. Grayscale’s legacy ETHE trust, which converted to an ETF at launch, recorded $4.28 billion in outflows over the same period. Daily flow data show the inflection. ETHA absorbed more than $160 million on June 11 alone, and the complex booked five separate days above $100 million between May 30 and June 23. Grayscale’s redemptions slowed during the same window, allowing aggregate flows to turn sharply higher. ETHA and FETH charge 0.25% management fees, matching the sector median and undercutting ETHE’s 2.5% rate. Lower costs, combined with established primary-market relationships, continue to steer inflows toward BlackRock and Fidelity, according to a CoinShares report that spoke with brokers who allocate on behalf of wealth managers. The report highlighted three factors as drivers for the June surge. The first is a rebound in ETH’s price relative to Bitcoin, coinciding with the Internal Revenue Service’s more explicit guidance on staking income within grantor-trust ETFs. Lastly, larger rebalancing orders from multi-asset allocators, treating ETH as a portfolio extension rather than a standalone speculative bet, contributed to the surge in inflows. The next quarterly Form 13F deadline in mid-July will reveal whether professional managers joined the late-spring push. Through March 31, those firms accounted for less than 33% of spot Ethereum ETF assets, suggesting room for broader institutional uptake even as retail flows concentrate on low-fee vehicles.
