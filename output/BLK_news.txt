Title: Harvard Pours $443,000,000 Into Bitcoin As SEC Filing Reveals Massive BlackRock IBIT Purchase

Harvard just poured a major amount of cash into the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin. A new 13F filing with the SEC shows the university’s endowment has boosted its stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to 6,813,612 shares, worth about $443 million as of September 30th. This marks a 257% increase from Q2’s 1.91 million shares, worth $116 million. IBIT now tops Harvard’s US equity holdings, surpassing Microsoft at $323 million and Amazon at $235 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says the move represents a seal of approval for Bitcoin ETFs. “It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho.” IBIT now has $81 billion in assets, capturing 35% of all spot Bitcoin ETF inflows.

Title: Bored with index funds? Here are tips for buying individual stocks.
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/17/stock-tips-investment-index-funds-nvidia-sp500-retirement/87236706007/

You heard from a friend who bought some stock in Nvidia or Amazon or Apple when it was cheap, and now those shares are worth five or six figures. Those are inspiring stories. But how much can you safely invest in individual stocks? Financial planners advise armchair investors and retirement savers that the smartest move is usually to buy shares of index funds, the kind that track the performance of broad stock indexes or the entire market. Single stocks tend to be much more volatile. But millions of investors buy shares of individual stock, and lots of them have success stories. Is there a place for individual stocks in your retirement portfolio? If so, how much is too much? We asked several investment experts. Ordinary Americans are passionate about investing in individual stocks. A recent survey by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth found that 54% of low- and moderate-income Americans (those earning $30,000-$80,000 a year) invest in capital markets, and that new investors favor single stocks over mutual funds and ETFs. Investors may watch YouTube and TikTok videos from influencers who claim to have can’t-miss stock picks. They troll the internet for recommendations from The Motley Fool and Morningstar. Then, they sit back and wait for a stock to take off. “There’s a certain element of fun to this,” said Zachary Rayfield, head of goals-based investing research at Vanguard. Ready to buy some individual stocks? Here are a few tips. If you invest in index funds or target-date retirement funds, your investment will probably track the market as a whole. Stock indexes do well in some years, poorly in others, but they are far less mercurial than individual stocks. With single stocks, you’re likely to see big swings, and not always up. If you’re just starting out, experts say, it’s wise to invest only a small share of your portfolio in individual stocks. That’s especially true if you’re investing with your retirement savings. “I think everyone’s retirement should be built on a foundation of index funds,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser at The Motley Fool. “And then you can gradually move into individual stocks,” committing “maybe 5%” of your portfolio. “And then you might find that you absolutely love it, and you can gradually increase that percentage.” However much money you invest in single stocks, investment experts say, try to avoid owning too much of one stock. “A simple rule of thumb is, do not let any one position in your portfolio account for more than 5 to 10% of the overall value of your portfolio,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. Overconcentration can happen by accident. Let’s say you bought some shares of Nvidia a few years ago, and you watched them multiply tenfold in value. Today, those shares might make up a large share of your holdings. “Many of our members have 30% of their portfolio in Nvidia,” said Brokamp, whose site has recommended the stock for years. The problem with individual stocks is that “you’re vulnerable to steep declines of your portfolio if one of them goes down significantly,” Silver said. That’s less of a problem if the stock represents 5% of your portfolio, more concerning if it’s 30%. “Individual stocks can be a great way to complement a well-diversified portfolio, but it's important to ensure that no single security overshadows your overall mix,” said Ryan Viktorin, vice president and financial consultant at Fidelity Investments. Diversification, in investment parlance, means holding different kinds of assets. You can diversify by holding stocks in different sectors, large and small companies, American and foreign markets, and by holding things that aren’t stocks, like bonds and money market funds. If you’re devoting only 5% or 10% of your portfolio to single stocks, you don’t necessarily have to worry about diversifying those stocks. To Silver of Investopedia, “it’s better to concentrate on 5 to 10 stocks that you believe in, that have a track record,” and build sizeable holdings in those companies. “If you have invested in any of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 over the past five years and you have built positions in those companies, you have outperformed the stock market,” Silver said. Case in point: Nvidia. Brokamp of Motley Fool suggests a broader approach. “You should own at least 25 stocks, and they should be diversified,” representing different types of companies, he said. Silver’s approach gives you larger stakes in fewer companies. Brokamp’s gives you more diversification, but you get a smaller stake in each stock. One axiom of investing dictates that actively managed funds often underperform the market as a whole. Simply put: It’s hard to beat the market by picking stocks yourself. And that rule surely applies to amateur stock pickers. “If you do this yourself, you’re becoming an active manager,” said Rayfield of Vanguard. “And a lot of active managers don’t outperform the broader market.” Savvy investors sell off diminished stocks at a loss, then use the loss to offset gains on other investments at tax time, a technique called tax-loss harvesting. Paring down underperforming stocks can leave an investor with an overly rosy view of their success. “If we’re selling the losers, sometimes we get a little high on our horse about what our capabilities are,” said Colin Day, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. “We forget the losers. We only remember the winners.” If you invest in a significant number of single stocks, Brokamp said, expect them to drift in different directions, some rising, some falling. The returns won’t resemble the path of a broad index fund, which captures the collective movement of many stocks. “Many of your individual stocks will be duds,” Brokamp said. “It’s the handful of successes that will drive your return.”

ACS Group and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a BlackRock company, have agreed to form a joint venture (JV) to develop and operate data centres across multiple international markets. The 50-50 partnership will launch with an initial portfolio of 1.7 gigawatts (GW) in data centre assets currently under development by ACS in Europe, the US, and Australia. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more The transaction values this portfolio at approximately €2bn ($2.3bn), split between an upfront cash payment of about €1bn and initial earn-outs of up to €1bn, subject to certain commercial milestones. Furthermore, an earn-out of up to €200m may be triggered by further pipeline projects under review. The JV agreement is contingent on receipt of all the necessary regulatory approvals. GIP chairman and CEO Bayo Ogunlesi said: “As AI continues to reshape many sectors of the global economy, today’s announcement will allow us to continue to support innovation at scale. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. “GIP has a longstanding and deep relationship with ACS and together we are committed to building the infrastructure required for the growth of cloud and AI investment and support transformative growth.” The platform’s operational model will be based on full-lifecycle project delivery provided by ACS Group subsidiaries, covering land acquisition, permitting, design, build, commissioning, and operations. The collaboration aims to address the needs of hyperscale clients and enterprise AI workloads seeking rapid deployment, grid interconnection, renewable energy sources, and modular data centre architecture. ACS Group CEO Juan Santamaría said: “This agreement is a decisive step in our strategy to lead the digital infrastructure sector globally. “By joining forces with GIP, we are combining ACS’s development, engineering, and construction expertise with the deep investment capacity and industry experience of one of the world’s leading infrastructure investors.” ACS Group is currently assessing a potential project pipeline exceeding 11GW across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. The group has previously constructed over 5.5GW of data centre capacity through affiliates including Turner Construction Company (and its Dornan Group division) and Leighton Asia. GIP invests in large-scale digital infrastructure and expects the partnership to extend its reach within data centre markets globally. In October 2025, a consortium comprising the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), MGX, and GIP agreed to acquire Aligned Data Centers in a deal valuing the company at approximately $40bn.

Title: The new business deals, Zelensky, the…sea bass and the Pax Americana, how the M.M. treats Samaras, Metlen’s new acquisition and the sale of Iktinos

Hello, some thoughts on today’s anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. Usually, all over the world, after a few years have passed from a historic event for a country, the state, the protagonists—if they are still alive—and society honor that very event with ceremonies of remembrance and respect, some tributes, but generally with peaceful demonstrations of collective memory. In Greece, 52 years later, the day of the uprising of students and other citizens against the Junta becomes an occasion to smash and wreck Athens, to destroy with paint the…martyr-like (in every sense) façade of the Polytechnic and, by the end of the day, to burn…a few shops in the center of Athens with Molotov cocktails, right in front of the eyes of thousands of stunned tourists who are still enjoying—mid-November—the blessed Greek weather. If this is what we want half a century later, let us reflect on it. But I think that the overwhelming majority of people do not want this, without it meaning that they do not honor the people who rose up then against the Junta and who either risked or lost their lives. Business and Pax Americana Beyond that, everything we have seen for the past 15 days happening in Athens regarding the geopolitical and business agreements with the USA was completed yesterday with the arrival of Zelensky, who came to sign that Ukraine will procure—via Greece—American LNG. As for the rest of what he is asking, mainly in weapons and such, I don’t think he will get it, and I think the most substantial meeting he had here yesterday was with Ambassador Guilfoyle regarding the agreement, and not only that, since of course he is very interested in the direct and effective access she has to the President of the United States. In any case, let me repeat that for the last three weeks the “American factor” has been steadily here, building deals and business agreements, and is not in Turkey, with whatever that implies. But mainly, what interests everyone is the security of the country against Turkey, which, of course, is primarily ensured by the Americans. That “I am here” which Guilfoyle said recently at the Greece Talks conference last Friday, when she was asked about the Eastern threat, is currently linked with the “Vertical Corridor,” which not only passes through Greece but is the entry gate for American natural gas into Europe. Sea bass and LNG I should tell you that the atmosphere yesterday at the Maximos Mansion was very warm, while K.M. had also planned to host Zelensky and the Ukrainian delegation. After the statements and the signing of the gas agreement, there was a lunch for the two delegations, with a menu of sea bass with greens and bouillabaisse, and I hear that Zelensky didn’t drink wine. Now, I don’t know whether he liked the sea bass, but the agreement for the supply of gas was certainly crucial for him, as winter in Ukraine is baring its teeth. This agreement was essentially the follow-up to the agreement announced at P-TEC for the AKTOR–DEPA partnership for LNG transport, and it will go into operation at the end of December. Immediate profits from LNG for AKTOR Taking the opportunity from what we said earlier, let me add an important business tip. As announced, DEPA Commercial and Naftogaz of Ukraine yesterday signed a Declaration of Intent for the supply of natural gas to the Ukrainian market for the winter period, from December 2025 to March 2026. The agreement stipulates that the transport of LNG from the USA will be carried out via “Route 1,” which has been allocated to the Transmission System Operators (TSOs). If we “translate” the announcement in business terms, it means that the interstate agreement will be executed via Atlantic-See LNG Trade (of Venture Global, AKTOR, and DEPA). Consequently, the trade of American LNG starts immediately, from mid-December, and not in 2030—something that means that AKTOR’s 60% subsidiary will already begin to produce results for its balance sheet from early 2026, since the results of Atlantic-See LNG are consolidated into those of AKTOR. In other words, the AKTOR group begins to record profits from the new activity much earlier. Kimberly and the drones As for energy matters and Greece’s decision to play the card of this agreement, do not overlook the role of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has come to Greece with a clear agenda, which she described last Friday at Greece Talks. Let me add, parenthetically, that her interview generated a lot of discussion and she herself was satisfied because she conveyed clear messages. Beyond that, this time there was little discussion about weapons in the foreground, but something is moving in the background. For example, I do not consider it coincidental that the Chief of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff, Choupis, was present yesterday at noon at the Maximos Mansion, as he participated in the extended meeting of the delegations. The Ukrainians are definitely asking for weapons that we cannot provide, such as Patriots. But we do have some “decommissioned” Russian weapons that have not been supported for some years now. I hear that the Ukrainians have begun to put on the table the provision of Ukrainian drones to our country in return, but an agreement is still a way off. The interview on ERT Before departing for Singapore on Wednesday (he will return on Saturday), K.M. is expected, as I hear, to give an in-depth, wide-ranging interview. It will be on the morning show of ERTNews (Papachlimintzos–Douka), his first appearance on public television since the launch of the new news channel. Whether it will be Tuesday or Wednesday will likely be “locked in” today. Stamatis and Mitsotakis Yesterday, after a hard battle with cancer, Dimitris Stamatis passed away—a modest, serious, and always conciliatory politician, a close friend of Antonis Samaras. I was struck by the excerpt in Mitsotakis’ condolence statement: “…when we served together in the government under Antonis Samaras.” A similar statement was made by Skertsos, referring to his presence in the 2012–14 government: “…when we kept the country together during the difficult years under the guidance of A. Samaras and E. Venizelos.” I have the impression that the entire New Democracy party, from K.M. down to the rank-and-file members, will view Samaras in a completely opposite way from how he views them—and especially the Prime Minister. Pavlos Marinakis Pavlos Marinakis’ bill regarding ERT, the media it regulates, their long-standing pending issues, and also the rule of law, passed triumphantly through Parliament’s competent committees on Friday, and all the relevant sector bodies spoke highly of it—even those… politically opposed. Tsapanidou from SYRIZA, as well as almost the rest of the opposition, were against it, proving why these people are “elsewhere” and generally unable to understand that blanket refusal leads nowhere. METLEN submits an offer, PPC goes to London for the business plan Moving on to market news—which today I assume will shift into a different pattern after the Fitch upgrade and the news from Euronext. The week begins with significant business developments from major groups and smaller listed companies. First of all, today METLEN submits its financial offer for the acquisition of the aluminum plant in Dunkirk. If the bet pays off, the profile of the metallurgy sector for METLEN will change, with the group adding to the sector (based on last year’s results) an annual EBITDA of about €300 million and net profits of €150 million. The baton is passed on Wednesday to PPC, which is presenting in London the business plan that is said to involve investments of over €10 billion for the period 2026–2028. The focus is on whether PPC’s announcements will confirm the recent market rumors of a roughly €1 billion capital increase at €14 per share, combined with interest from BlackRock in acquiring a significant stake. Preliminary agreement between IKTINOS and a fund Since I mentioned smaller listed companies earlier, let me add that the management of IKTINOS is taking steps to leverage its assets with the goal of freeing the listed company from debt. In this context, according to information, IKTINOS is said to have reached a preliminary agreement with a foreign fund for the 2,500-acre property it owns in the Faneromeni bay in Sitia, Crete. Developments are expected immediately. National Insurance acquisition by December 5 The acquisition of 100% of National Insurance by Piraeus Bank is in its final stretch, as the Bank of Greece has granted approval and next week approval is also expected from the SSM. By December 5, based on the dates given by the authorities, the acquisition will have been completed, and the second essential chapter begins for the insurance company but also for the banks (Piraeus Bank and National Bank) in terms of bancassurance. I’m no prophet, but something tells me that this chapter will not be exhausted “from one moment to the next,” as we say. It will require a lot of groundwork both from Piraeus Bank and from the National Bank. It is a structural change that reshapes long-standing relationships with many technical and legal issues, and some time will be needed before it wraps up. Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) in the arms of Euronext Now regarding HELEX, which we mentioned above: last Thursday and especially Friday, individual small shareholders of HELEX showed that they are convinced by the Public Offer of Stéphane Boujnah and handed over their shares to brokerage firms, which in turn mobilized even more because of the special 0.4% commission they had on the transaction. Today at 2 p.m. the process formally closes, with the acceptance rate—according to market information—expected to exceed 55% and move toward 60%. Success is considered a given, but the column reserves judgment on the exact percentage. What is certain is that the strategy paid off: institutional investors—Greek and foreign funds that already held Euronext shares—hurried to exchange. For them, the transition was a simple administrative move without tax implications. Individuals acted on Thursday and Friday. The fact is that after the results are announced the day after tomorrow, November 19, the Athens Stock Exchange enters the pan-European network. On November 24, HELEX shares will be traded simultaneously in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon, and Paris. The next chapter is the squeeze-out: Euronext will seek 90% or more so as to integrate HELEX into the group. Byte: heading for EBITDA over €10 million in the 9-month period Byte, as IDEAL presented last October during Investor Day, is transforming into the parent company for its IT investments, with subsidiaries Adacom and Bluestream. According to information, the picture of the 9-month results follows a trajectory similar to that of the first half. If we compare these figures, then we expect revenue above €75 million and EBITDA above €10 million. I hear that the company’s executives are very pleased because the gross profit margin is increasing by more than 7 points and the EBITDA margin is stabilizing at 15%, over 4% higher than last year. They also say that the contribution of projects carried out by the companies abroad is significant and represents a new pillar for future growth. IDEAL’s results on Thursday, 20/11, will likely confirm management’s expectations as presented in October. The next step is to see whether the strong results will be reflected in the share price and whether IT sector valuations will help IDEAL. Swiss-franc loans: institutionally yes… technically maybe The Ministry of National Economy and Finance is working full-time on the institutional framework for the restructuring of Swiss-franc loans, listening to the banks but clearly keeping its focus on the borrowers. The legislative framework is expected to be ready by the end of the year. However, its implementation may require a longer time. The technical aspect of implementation is not the simplest. It is therefore very likely that the platform of the out-of-court settlement mechanism will be used for the Swiss-franc loan restructurings. The adjustments required to allow both vulnerable and non-vulnerable borrowers to enter are technically complex and may require some time. Even if a new application is developed to serve this purpose, it too will need time. Giannis Mytilineos’ new companies “Sea Front Bliss I” and “Sea Front Bliss II” are the names of the two new companies founded last Friday, November 14, and are owned by businessman Giannis Mytilineos. The purpose of the two companies, headquartered in Varibombi, is—among other things—the buying and selling and management of real estate and, in particular, the construction of buildings either for own use or for exploitation in any way, or for resale, located anywhere in Greece or abroad. Also, the construction, leasing, subleasing, renovation, repair, expansion, maintenance, exploitation, management and general utilization of all kinds of properties, urban or otherwise, owned by the company or third parties; the establishment, construction, operation, management and exploitation of all types of hotels and tourist units, housing complexes, sports facilities, etc. The initial share capital totals €3,300,000, specifically €2,200,000 for “Sea Front Bliss I” and €1,100,000 for “Sea Front Bliss II,” divided into shares with a nominal value of €100 each. The sole shareholder is the Cypriot company Nioval Ltd, whose sole shareholder is Giannis Mytilineos, who, as is well known, in addition to his other activities (shipping, etc.) also owns the emblematic Tatoi Club. The management of the two newly established companies includes Anastasia Mouchlidi as Chairwoman and CEO, Elisavet Paraskeopoulou, and Mytilineos’ two daughters, Amalia and Ioli, as members. They are the same individuals, in the same roles, who staff Tatoi Residences, the company founded last March. The book of Odysseas Athanasiou On November 25, the book “Why They Succeeded – 6 States from the Shadows to the Top,” written by Lamda Development CEO Odysseas Athanasiou, is expected to be released. The head of LAMDA, who has been at the helm of the group since the late 2000s, will speak at the launch event about his book, for which he offers an initial idea of its subject, stating that it is “a personal search regarding how small countries without natural resources or power managed to rise to the top. It is not a book about economics or politics. It is a book about how the right choices and faith in people can change a country’s future.” The presentation will take place on Tuesday, 2/12/25, at the National Gallery, and speaking about Athanasiou’s writing project will be the Governor of the Bank of Greece, Yiannis Stournaras, and EKPA professor Maria Efthymiou. A Thessalonian at the World Bank The information comes from reliable sources, although for now there is no official announcement. Antonis Kamaras, a scholar from Thessaloniki with a rich academic and professional background, will be Greece’s representative at the World Bank. It is a position held from 2013 to 2021 by Christos Papoutsis (former minister and European Commissioner under PASOK), and from early 2021 by a woman for the first time, economist Eleni Panagiotarea (daughter of journalist Anna Panagiotarea). For the past year, the position had remained vacant. Now it is being taken up by Antonis Kamaras, who studied at Connecticut College and the London School of Economics and has worked professionally as a consultant at the National Bank of Greece and the Municipality of Thessaloniki. He is a researcher at ELIAMEP and a founding member of the Greek Diaspora Project at SEESOX (Oxford). The…crazy regulation that favors high-speed ships over conventional ones A puzzle remains regarding how ferry routes are scheduled. Today two different rules apply: conventional ships must operate all year round, while high-speed vessels can operate for at least four months. However, the market picture has changed radically: 12 years ago there were just 13 high-speed vessels; today there are 34. This has two consequences:a) Huge fluctuations in prices. On routes with competition, ticket prices can fall to €0.60/mile, while as soon as competition disappears they rise to €3.25/mile.b) Conventional ships, which are obliged to operate in winter, are financially squeezed in summer by the high-speed vessels and struggle to make the year viable. The Competition Commission notes that if this asymmetry continues, there is a risk that winter routes will be reduced, something that would harm the cohesion of the islands. Silent Chinese wave at the Port of Piraeus The US and China may have temporarily buried the hatchet in their business-trade war, but each continues to keep a close eye on the other. The news that the Americans are planning a strategic investment to create an alternative commercial corridor to counter COSCO and the Port of Piraeus—by promoting Elefsina—did not go unnoticed in Beijing. At Greece’s main port, a plan has long been sitting in the drawers: the construction of a fourth pier, in the space between the car terminal and Pier I. This project is not part of COSCO’s mandatory commitments. Piraeus, due to the large volumes it handles, is running out of vital space, approaching its ceiling of 5.5 million TEUs. A fourth pier would give the Chinese operators the ability to increase container throughput by at least one million TEUs. However, without the authorities’ green light, the Chinese cannot move forward, so they are keeping a wait-and-see stance, monitoring developments. “There’s a certain silence,” people from the port told me. Greek shipping at full throttle Greek shipping groups continue to sweep both the shipyards and the secondhand market. On the newbuilding front, Thenamaris (Nikolas Martinou), StealthGas (Harry Vafias), Venergy (Byron Vasileiadis), and Akrotiri Tankers (Marielena Prokopiou & Konstantinos Lampsias) led the way with fresh tanker orders, investing in modern, scrubber-fitted vessels—an indication that the major players are looking long-term and betting on cleaner, more efficient shipping. Meanwhile, Costamare and Latsco remain active in containerships, strengthening their presence in East Asian shipyards. In the secondhand market, Greek activity was visible on both the buying and selling sides, especially in dry bulk. Aegean Bulk stood out by selling the Supramax Anemos (2011), while another Greek group acquired the Isolda D (Handysize, 2011). Overall, over the last twelve months Greek shipowners have signed 43 new tanker orders, 6 bulk carrier orders, and conducted 41 tanker acquisitions and 98 bulker purchases in the resale market. Greece thus comfortably maintains its global lead in S&P activity. Trek enters the Athens Exchange Alternative Market Today marks the start of trading for Trek Development on the ASE Alternative Market. The Papapolyzos family company is active in infrastructure project development and construction, with a focus on energy, environment, water management, and Smart City applications. After 30 years of operations, the company is moving to its next phase, planning an investment program of €4.6 million, financed by €1.9 million from the listing and €2.7 million from internal funds and projected profits for 2025–2027. About 30% of the plan concerns organic growth—primarily staffing and upgrading the operations of its Munich subsidiary—while 70% will go toward acquiring specialized companies in Greece and the EU. Four stocks looking for new highs The Titan share has been unstoppable for the past five sessions, rallying from €40 to nearly €44 and inching closer to its record of €45.8. The driver is the cement group’s four-year plan, involving investments up to €4 billion and EBITDA of €1 billion by 2029. Also on the table is the acquisition of the French company Vracs De L’Estuaire, with Titan in exclusive talks. Analysts reinforce the positive mood: Citi has set a target price of €56.1, S&P upgraded Titan’s rating to BB+, and Fitch raised its outlook to positive. Motor Oil exceeded €28 intraday over the last two sessions, closing just below that mark. With six consecutive gains, the stock would hit a new all-time high with an additional 2.2% rise. It’s a remarkable comeback for a share that had dropped below €20 seven months ago, with the interim dividend of €0.35 providing momentum. Viohalco remains in the spotlight, hitting a new high and approaching €10. Its subsidiary ElvalHalcor is following suit, extending its multi-year high and aiming to reach €3.5 for the first time since November 2007. A new era for EY Greece, in a historic Thessaloniki landmark The historic Matarasso–Altshech building—one of Thessaloniki’s most iconic Art Deco structures—will now house EY Greece’s administrative base in the city. Designed in the 1930s by architect Moshe Kazis, and once home to the Athens Stock Exchange’s local branch, the building has been transformed into a modern, flexible, and inclusive workspace while preserving its original identity. The renovation respected the building’s historic architecture, retaining signature elements of the era while adapting the space to the needs of a modern international consulting organization. The new facilities will host teams serving clients across sectors from finance to technology. On 22–23 November, the public will be able to take a look inside as part of EY’s Open House. A flood of money in the markets The terms are Money Supply M2 and M3, referring to the total money circulating in an economy at a given moment. Globally, this money stock reached $142 trillion in September 2025—an all-time record that reveals a fundamental shift in the world economy. The +9.1% increase in 2025 alone represents around $12 trillion. Over the past 25 years (since 2000), global money supply has grown at an average 7% CAGR, with only brief pauses during the 2008 crisis and the 2020 pandemic. After each crisis, the rebound was rapid and monetary expansion even stronger. Central banks face a dilemma: interest rate hikes since 2022 should have restricted liquidity, yet money supply continues to expand. The 2025 depreciation of the US dollar is the hidden key: as money loses value, investors are forced to shift into assets that protect against inflation. Capital seeks refuge from devaluation—and investing becomes not a choice, but a survival necessity for capital. Explore related questions

Title: Bitcoin: November 2025 turns historic – For all the wrong reasons

Analyzing why Bitcoin is at risk of the biggest ETF outflows ever. Bitcoin is facing its second-biggest ETF outflows since its launch, and could set a new record. It was unlikely that the price of Bitcoin could reverse the losses incurred in November if it ends in red. Bitcoin [BTC] slipped below the $100,000 mark and continued to trade below it as Bitcoin ETFs and quarterly returns followed the drain. In the meantime, the entire crypto market rose slightly by less than a percent while the Fear & Greed Index hit 17, dipping to extreme fear levels. Currently, the market seems to be heading towards its worst-ever month in terms of BTC ETF outflows and quarterly returns. As per data from SosoValue, Bitcoin ETFs were seeing the second-biggest outflow in 2025, which was at $2.33 billion while the month was still midway. Similar outflows through the remaining weeks would see November hit a new record. This year’s February had the biggest ETF outflows, which almost hit $4 billion. However, given that Bitcoin has now entered a discount zone after falling below $100K, the outflows could potentially reverse. Source: SosoValue The outflows have stemmed from the overall weakness seen in the market, with BTC’s price also facing a similar fate. Particularly, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Fidelity led outflows in the past 24 hours, as per CoinGlass data. BlackRock saw more than 4.65K BTC in outflows, contributing to more than 94% of the total 4.94K BTC on the day. Bitcoin continued to struggle in terms of quarterly returns, as did Ethereum [ETH], which reflected a general market weakness. Since 2018, when BTC lost more than 42% in the last quarter, this year’s quarter has come the closest. However, this quarter’s loss still represents about a third of that of 2018. Other years were 2022 and 2019, which lost about 14.75% and 13.54%, respectively, as per CoinGlass data. Source: CoinGlass Ethereum was also seeing its worst returns since 2019. The returns were a reflection of the lost confidence among traders in the crypto sector. Historical data indicated that every red November was followed by a similar December, making it unlikely for BTC to reverse this sentiment. The pattern was evident in 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022, which were red in the last two months of the year. On the charts, BTC price slipped below a 15-month trendline support, as per Trader Tardigrade’s analysis on X (formerly Twitter). This further stressed the weakness of Bitcoin and its products, like ETFs. Reclaiming the support level would be very bullish for BTC, while the reverse would extend losses. The next area of interest on the downside is around $80K, while on the upside, it is sitting at $126K. Source: Trader Tardigrade Notably, only a change in crypto market sentiment would change the current downtrend in price action, returns, and BTC ETF flows. November was headed to be the biggest with outflows if the current trend stayed. However, given that prices had been declining for over a month and were at significant discounts, there was still potential for a rebound.

Title: Ireland reminded naysayers they haven’t gone away with dismantling of Australia
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/11/17/ireland-reminded-people-they-havent-gone-away-with-dismantling-of-australia/

Oh ye of little faith. For three weeks, on and off the record, coaches and players alike had been telling us they had a performance like this in the making. And on a squally Saturday night in a packed Aviva, so a record win over Australia came to pass. This was a well-timed reminder to themselves, the world of punditry and the supporters that Ireland remain a very good side. “That’s a given for me,” maintained Andy Farrell, who was critical of the previous two displays but never lost faith in his team’s ability. “We’re a very good side. There’s no doubt about that. You could put in all sorts of reasons of why the first performance or the second performance or whatever, but that’s never been in doubt, in my mind anyway.” Breaking free, in some respects from their own shackles, Ireland shot out of the blocks and then finished with a flourish, the replacements contributing to a true squad effort. They bookended the game with a Mack Hansen hat-trick in the first half-hour and another three tries in an expressive and clinical last 10 minutes. “Sometimes you prepare really well and it doesn’t transfer,” reflected Farrell. “We had an unbelievable warm-up out there today and I was going, ‘wow, if Carlsberg could do warm-ups, that would be it. But that doesn’t transfer either sometimes. I’ve seen unbelievably rubbish warm-ups and seen teams play well. So, it’s nice that we prepare well and we’ve got a performance on the back of it.” There was also the palpable ripple effects of the international football team’s memorable night last Thursday. “Yeah, it was class,” said Jack Conan of Ireland’s 2-0 win over Portugal – and this was before Sunday’s extraordinary events in Budapest. “A few of the lads went who weren’t involved and everyone’s kind of jealous that they went and a lot of us didn’t go, but it was on in the team room and we were loving it. “You looked at Thursday night and the atmosphere here and it was class. You know, Aaron Rowe singing Amhrán na bhFiann, which was brilliant and the lads would know him quite well. We were loving that and even just the performance and the doggedness of how the lads played on Thursday night was unreal,” added Conan. “We loved it and yeah, we talked about riding that wave of momentum.” The same can be said of the coming week and surfing an even bigger wave in the light of the Republic of Ireland’s dramatic 3-2 win in Budapest, as Farrell’s team prepare to welcome the all-conquering, multi-faceted South Africa. After their ominous 14-man win over France in Paris, Rassie Erasmus rested most of his frontliners for Saturday’s imperious 32-14 win over Italy in Turin, again achieved despite playing the majority of the game with 14 men. They arrive as the world’s number one side and back-to-back world champions. “Yeah, it’s great,” said Farrell of a perfectly scripted finale to the Autumn Nations Series and at an ideal kick-off time, 5.40pm, next Saturday. “It’s a fantastic place to be, isn’t it? The best in the world, everyone’s talking about them and the type of rugby that they’re playing. A rich vein of form and rightly so. They’ve played some brilliant stuff. “It’s a fantastic way to finish off our autumn. The last game at the Aviva. We’ll certainly enjoy this win, but the lads will be back on task and they’ll know what it means to everyone in Irish rugby as well, so we’ll look forward to that.” Yet again, all Farrell’s selection hunches were vindicated, not least Hansen at full-back. He completed only the second first-half hat-trick of tries by an Irish player in Test history. The first to do it was Eugene Davy in 1930, in a 14-11 win over Scotland at Murrayfield. [ ‘The worst team in Wallabies history’: Australian media show displeasure at Ireland defeatOpens in new window ] “Well, he gets rugby,” said Farrell of Hansen. “He can make a difference within the game. And also he’s got a good feel in the backfield. He understands the depth perception and all of that. He’s obviously very good in the air and in conditions like that, it’s always going to help any team. “He’s always been very good in the air. His skillset lends it to being that. He’s been brought up playing 10, 15 and wing. That’s why he’s such a nice player to watch.” It helped that the lineout delivered a perfect 10 and the Paddy McCarthy-infused scrum was potent, with Dan Sheehan and Caelan Doris delivering big games in a strong Irish pack. The confidence to stay positive, to keep trying things even after the inevitable mistakes on such a greasy surface and on such a wet and windy night, in many ways emanated from the calmness and inventiveness of Sam Prendergast. Here, in tandem with Jamison Gibson-Park, who seems somehow to be playing at 100 miles an hour while in cruise control, Prendergast was the orchestrator in chief of the Irish game. As well as his easy-on-the-eye control and array of passes, he and Gibson-Park terrorised the Wallabies back three, and particularly Max Jorgensen, with their aerial bombardment and variety of kicks. The reconfigured backrow, with Doris at seven for the first 50 minutes, perhaps had one eye on the Springboks. The same may also be said for playing Gibson-Park at fullback for the last 10 minutes in considering a 6-2 bench split. Gibson-Park applied the coup de grace with a cross-kick for Robbie Henshaw to score Ireland’s sixth try with the last play. “He’s going to start at seven next week,” quipped Farrell. “He was playing touch rugby and just enjoying himself. He’s just enjoying himself. He’s tough, strong as well. What a player.” While the unlucky Stuart McCloskey suffered a recurrence of the groin issues which forced him off in Chicago, Farrell expects to have Josh van der Flier and Garry Ringrose back in the mix. In a positive way, he has a number of selection considerations. Scoring sequence – 6 mins: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 7-0; 11: Hansen try, S Prendergast con 14-0; 18: Ikitau try, O’Connor con 14-7; 28: Hansen try 19-14; 40: McReight try, O’Connor con 19-14; Half-time 19-14; 57: Prendergast dg 22-14; 63: Crowley pen 25-14; 70: Doris try, Crowley con 32-14; 74: Pollard try 32-19; 78: Baird try, Crowley con 39-19; 81: Henshaw try, Crowley con 46-19 IRELAND: M Hansen; T O’Brien, R Henshaw, S McCloskey, J Lowe; S Prendergast, J Gibson-Park; P McCarthy, D Sheehan, T Furlong, J Ryan, T Beirne, R Baird, C Doris (capt), J Conan.

Title: Scrum-ptious style: three Leinster rugby players show their flair for fashion

We know how they look – and perform – on the pitch. But how do they tackle looking glamorous off the pitch? Here, three Leinster rugby players – Eimear Corri Fallon, Vicky Elmes Kinlan and Hannah Wilson – show their flair dressing up and share their style secrets. Vicky Elmes Kinlan, from Rathnew, Co Wicklow, started playing rugby at the age of 12, encouraged by her father, Mick. She now represents Wicklow RFC at club level, and has played for Ireland on both the Sevens and 15s teams. “I am very basic when it comes to style and know what suits my body type, so I stick to what I know. I am more muscly on my upper half and dress to suit that,” she says. “I love pants, long skirts worn with smaller tops. I buy online while also checking out the sales. “I tend to prefer neutral colours and don’t like pattern. I would never have tried on this dress, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I now like it. I usually wear something more fitted, but I like its flowy silhouette. I never really wear dresses, even to dinner dances, where most girls wear floor length, though I did wear a blue one to my debs. “I love gold jewellery. I like the way people express themselves in how they dress.” White ruffle dress, Rixo, €373; metallic shoes, Dune, €80; earrings, Astrid & Miyu, €115 Wilson, a promising young backline talent for Leinster Women’s Rugby, started playing at the age of five in Kildare. She plays club rugby with Old Belvedere and earned selection for the Ireland U-20 women’s squad in 2024. “I have never worn a skirt until now, as I just don’t feel comfortable in them – I tend to wear jeans, dressy trousers and a jumper with trainers. I buy a lot from All Saints, but I also have a black two-piece from Reiss. I don’t like showing my bruised legs all the way up when I don’t have to wear training outfits. “I’m not a big shopper, but I like to buy when there is a purpose. I have a big build, so I have to try everything on before I buy. I stick to neutrals – black, beige, grey with a bit of denim. “I get my hair colour done every four months. I feel more pressure of people watching me on rather than off the pitch, and always have my tan when I know there will be pictures because I am so pale. I also wear braids – six! – in my hair. It’s sore getting them, but they are better than a ponytail that gets messed up in a scrum. “I love silver jewellery and used to wear seven rings on my fingers along with bracelets – I have one Cartier ring, which I got for my 18th, and a Tiffany silver ring I got for my 21st. “What I love about rugby is the feeling of success and having a purpose to get up in the morning. And of course, the friendship.” Coat, Maje, €386; linen waistcoat, Rixo, €80; linen midi skirt, Rixo, €230; gold heeled sandals, €248 From Laois and a former player with Portlaoise RFC, Eimear Corri Fallon announced her retirement from international rugby earlier this month to focus on her career as a doctor (she studied sports science at Dublin City University and medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland), but will still represent Leinster Rugby Women and Blackrock College RFC at club level. “I started playing at 23. Athletics was my background. Medicine came into my head when I was studying sports science, and the health module made me realise my interest in the human body and physiology. “I’ve loved fashion since I was a child, and I’m a shopaholic. Scrubs and rugby kit are not so glamorous, but you don’t have a choice. I like to express myself through clothes, and I love bright colours so there are no pastels in my wardrobe but big blues or pinks. My style is casual – city-wear jeans and a lot of blazers, but when I am going out, I go all out with make-up hair, sequins and satin skirts. I love skorts because I am quite tall, which I wear with long or knee-length boots – they are a game changer. I would never wear pastels nor midi dresses, and cargo pants don’t suit me. “I’d describe my style as bright, fun and elegant chic. I buy in Kildare Village, Sandra, Maje and Self Portrait, and I love buying make-up as well. I work in Naas hospital as a doctor in A&E five days a week and on call at weekends, so it’s a bright pair of royal blue scrubs. “I would not usually go for a full co-ordinating suit like this one – it’s such a statement piece – but would wear one piece with something else. So my style is primarily casual. Footwear tends to be low block heels.” Cropped jacket, Maje, €295; trousers, Maje, €195; heels, Dune, €85 All clothes and accessories from Kildare Village, a partner of Leinster Rugby, shot on location in Drew Studios in Dublin.

Binance stated that allowing institutional clients to hold BUIDL and other tokenized RWAs off-exchange enables them to meet internal risk controls, thereby unlocking greater participation and scalability in digital asset trading, a move that benefits both market stability and institutional engagement. This development follows Binance’s July announcement supporting the RWAs USCY and cUSDO as off-exchange collateral, marking another step in the company’s growing commitment to tokenized assets In parallel, BUIDL is launching a new share class on the BNB Chain network, one of the world’s leading blockchain ecosystems, expanding investor access and interoperability with other onchain financial applications.

With assets under management (AUM) exceeding ₹7,000 crore (over $800 million), Artha Bharat is already in advanced discussions with five independent investment management teams who plan to use its platform to launch funds ranging from $5 million to $50 million.

This model marks a new phase in India’s fund management ecosystem , enabling talented fund managers to establish regulated schemes in GIFT City without the heavy financial and administrative burden of setting up a separate fund management entity. “This is an excellent initiative by the IFSCA aimed at spurring entrepreneurship amongst talented fund managers who may lack the financial resources needed to float their own fund management entity in GIFT City,” added Sawrikar. Artha Bharat currently manages three diversified funds from GIFT City: * Artha Global Opportunities Fund – focused on private credit, distressed debt, and private equity opportunities. * Artha Global Multiplier Fund – a long-short, absolute-return hedge fund investing in the US markets. * Artha Bharat Absolute Return Fund – a USD-denominated arbitrage fund investing across equities, commodities, and interest rate futures, designed to deliver competitive short-term returns versus traditional fixed-income avenues.

CEA Anantha Nageswaran: India’s equity markets have grown impressively, but initial public offerings have increasingly become exit vehicles for early investors rather than mechanisms for raising long-term capital. This undermines the spirit of public markets. CEA: India cannot rely predominantly on bank credit for long-horizon financing. A deep and reliable bond market is a strategic necessity, particularly for financing long-term national objectives.

Last week’s larger market sell-off, which was triggered by hawkish comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials that dampened expectations for a December interest rate cut, caused gold prices to drop 2.5% and silver prices to drop 5.5%. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is citing the shutdown blackout as justification for maintaining unchanged interest rates in December. Naturally, this is in line with the proverb, “Do nothing when you do not know what to do.” Since the beginning of last week, the US dollar’s weakness and rumours that the Fed would resume asset purchases have served as catalysts for gold’s rise, but Thursday and Friday made it abundantly evident that this is no longer the case. Additionally, gold and silver faced pressure from position closing to meet margin calls brought on by declines in equity markets, which fell on Friday after the global selloff sparked by hawkish Fed signals. Market expectations for a 25 basis-point rate cut next month dropped to 42% from 64% earlier this week, down from more than 95% a month ago, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. The longest U.S. government shutdown ended Thursday, creating a major data gap that left the Fed and traders flying blind ahead of next month’s policy meeting. The U.S. government shutdown lasted 43 days, the longest in history, but the effects will likely be felt for the next few weeks. Some economic data, such as October’s CPI numbers, will be lost forever because that information is collected manually. For economists, this could be a significant issue because economic modelling depends on reliable, consistent data. In the end, inflation is not high enough to stop the Fed — especially as it continues to face pressure from President Donald Trump — from cutting interest rates, and even if the central bank skips the December meeting, rates will be lower in 2026. While there are clear signs that the U.S. labour market is losing significant momentum, even without October’s economic data, inflation is also not accelerating. One Federal Reserve meeting will not affect gold’s long-term fundamental support. There is uncertainty regarding the U.S. economy, tariffs, and the next interest rate move, so any pullback is likely to be short and shallow as the main drivers of gold remain in place.If gold prices sustain above $4150, we are likely to see the uptrend continuing; if prices sustain below $4050, we can see a correction towards the previous low to around $3900. This week’s failed attempt to break above $4200 per ounce has created some short-term bearish sentiment.After reaching crucial resistance over $54, the market is experiencing fresh selling pressure, and silver has started a wild rollercoaster ride. Silver has recovered all of its losses from last month’s severe selloff, which saw prices plummet 16% in only two weeks, over the past seven sessions. Despite the important double top that silver’s price action has formed, market sentiment is still largely bullish. For me to go firmly negative, silver must at least break and close below $50. The neckline must break around $47 for a double top to be confirmed, setting a target of $44. However, a run-up towards $56 may occur if prices defy gravity and surpass $53.50.

(Reuters) Exceeding most exit poll predictions, the NDA stormed back to power in the Bihar assembly election with a commanding mandate of 202 seats, far higher than 122 it won in the previous election. The recently launched women-centric cash transfer scheme played a major role in improving the voter turnout – especially among women, which reflected in the results as well. The Nitish Kumar-led JDU was a clear winner, snatching 40+ seats from the RJD, while the BJP (the single-largest party in terms of seats won) gained at the cost of the Congress (-13 seats). Although the results of the Bihar election send a clear signal of the political appeal of the BJP and its allies, we believe the JDU with 85 seats is currently in a commanding position at the Centre. Sunday, 16 November 2025: India’s leading petrochemical and fertiliser company Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) announced the appointment of Ms. Sweta Suman, IAS, as a Nominee Director representing Tamilnadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited (TIDCO) on its board.

Despite a softer revenue in H1CFY, the company has strengthened its profitability and sharpened its operating model post-IPO, setting up a more stable base for long-term growth. A key pillar of this strategy is retail expansion. The company plans to scale its footprint from 73 stores to around 120 over the next 24–36 months, supported by better real estate deals and measured store rollout. The company’s early success with its premium home-solution formats has reinforced management’s confidence in this direction. Alongside domestic growth, the company is also preparing to enter new international markets - beginning with Sri Lanka and Jakarta - before tapping opportunities in the Middle East. With rising ticket sizes, a stronger product mix and a sharp strategic pivot, the company is maintaining its target of reaching ₹1,000 crore in revenue over the next three years. In Q2 it reported revenues of ₹105 crore, PAT of ₹6 crore and margins of 23.5%. Entering H2 with strong momentum as demand for flexible workspaces continues to deepen across major Indian cities. With revenue growth already tracking above 30% and operational metrics holding steady, the company is well-placed to sustain its pace through CFY. Its scale-up strategy, powered by consistent property additions, rising seat capacity and stable occupancy, has given the company a clear line of sight on growth over the next several quarters. In Q2, it reported revenue of ₹354 crore, net profit of ₹28 crore and margin of 21%. Revenue increased 25% YoY to ₹2,135 crore. The YoY growth was primarily driven by an increase in outpatient department (OBD) visits. EBITDA rose 17.5% YoY to ₹575 crore. EBITDA margin improved slightly to 26.9% from 26.4% YoY. International patient revenue stood at ₹231 crore, up 25% YoY and 11% QoQ, accounting for approximately 9% of total hospital revenue. Overall EBITDA per bed for Q2 was ₹73.4 lakh, compared with ₹71.2 lakh YoY and ₹68.5 lakh QoQ. EBITDA per bed for existing units was ₹76.5 lakh, representing a 7% YoY increase. Max Lab, the company’s non-captive pathology vertical, reported revenue of ₹54 crore, growing 16% YoY and 11% QoQ. Max Lab services are now available in over 60 cities and offer a comprehensive range of more than 2,700 tests. Max@Home, the company’s home healthcare segment, generated gross revenue of ₹63 crore in Q2, up 20% YoY and 6% QoQ, driven by physio and rehab, critical care, medicine delivery and medical room services. Free cash flow from operations was ₹291 crore, compared with ₹464 crore YoY and ₹389 crore in Q1. The company deployed ₹456 crore towards ongoing expansion and facility upgrades at newer units and distributed ₹146 crore as dividends. Net debt at the end of the quarter was ₹2,067 crore, up from ₹1,755 crore at the end of June 2025. Pursuant to a binding term sheet executed in July 2025, JHL, a wholly owned subsidiary, divested hospitals located in Village Chitta and Anoopshahr, District Bulandshahr, effective September 18, 2025, to focus on super specialty care in larger cities. The NCLT Chandigarh Bench approved the scheme of amalgamation of JHL and CRL, both wholly owned subsidiaries, with an appointed date of October 5, 2024. The merger, accounted as a business combination under IND AS 103, resulted in a reversal of current tax of approximately ₹79 crore and recognition of deferred tax assets of ₹70 crore. The 160-bed brownfield tower, including an additional radiation oncology program, has been commissioned at MSSH Mohali. The 268-bed brownfield tower at Nanavati-Max, Mumbai, is scheduled for commissioning next week.

Title: Bitcoin fear hits 2025 lows – Yet institutions scoop up $24B: What gives?

The sell-off may be the tail-end of a six-month stealth bear phase. Because the Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 10, its lowest reading of 2025. ETFs added $24 billion this year, even as retail panic triggered $19B in liquidations. Bitcoin [BTC] sentiment has dropped to its lowest level of 2025, but the market isn’t breaking the way many fear. Retail traders are panicking, yet long-term signs remain steady while institutions continue to buy through ETFs. Experts are now saying this sell-off could be the final stretch of a six-month quiet bear phase. Will the market recover? Recent data from Alphractal showed the Crypto Fear & Greed Index falling to 10 at press time. This is the lowest sentiment reading of 2025. Source: Alphractal Such extreme fear has appeared only during market resets or the tail end of prolonged drawdowns. The index has now fallen from the mid-60s to near-zero territory within weeks, similar to the unwinding seen during mid-2021 and mid-2022. Source: Alphractal On top of that, the broader Alpha Crypto Sentiment Gauge shifted from neutral-bullish earlier this quarter to bearish and very bearish signals. That shift kept traders focused on possible capitulation zones. Over $19 billion in liquidations and 1.6 million wiped-out traders created the perfect setup for large players to absorb supply at lower prices. Long-term holders reportedly released 62,000 BTC since October, much of it flowing into ETFs managed by firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. Despite panic-driven selling, ETF balances have grown by $24 billion in 2025. This correction may be a structural transfer rather than a cycle top. Building on the narrative, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley noted in an X post that crypto may already be deep into a six-month bear phase. He argued that the traditional four-year cycle model no longer applied to a market shaped by ETF flows, regulation, and heavyweight institutions. Source: X By contrast, post-ETF dynamics introduced new mechanical buy-and-sell patterns that influenced volatility. Despite the recent drop, Horsley maintained that underlying conditions could support one of the strongest recovery environments yet.

Title: AIL wrap: Terenure coach hails ‘courage and guts’ as derby win nudges them closer to top

Carlos Spencer hailed the character of his team after Terenure moved to within a point of Energia All-Ireland League leaders St Mary’s with a gritty 14-12 win to end their neighbours’ unbeaten record. On a sodden Lakelands Park pitch, which nonetheless held up well, this full-on D6W derby captivated a crowd of about 4,000 from its first minute to a thunderous climax. The prolific Mick O’Gara opened the scoring before Terenure struck through John McKee’s close-range finish after a sweeping move released Caolan Dooley to link with the supporting Griffin Culver. O’Gara then landed three more penalties to inch St Mary’s 12-7 in front before they withheld a siege on the line inside the last 10 minutes. However, Terenure’s furious kick-chase and counter-ruck earned another onslaught from which flanker Oisín McCormack burrowed over and Chris Cosgrave landed another fine conversion. Cue a wave of attacks from distance by St Mary’s, with Conor Dean puling the strings, which led to a 52-metre penalty by O‘Gara with the last kick which had the legs but drifted wide. “It’s a shame that the weather didn’t play its part and give us a nice day. We could probably have played a bit more rugby,” said Spencer. “So, we had to tidy things up a bit and sometimes it became a bit of a scrap. “We missed out on a couple of opportunities and our discipline let us down, but we stayed in the fight and grafted to show true character. I’m very proud of that and when we got our opportunity we took it. We didn’t give in, which was good.” His counterpart, Mark McHugh, expressed similar sentiments. “A typical derby, no quarter given and none asked. We could have nicked it at the end, justly or unjustly I don’t know, but they are a really good team. “They’re going to be there or thereabouts at the end and I really hope we will be as well. Disappointed to lose, but equally delighted with the fight we showed and the courage and the guts, because they are attributes you can’t coach.” Champions Clontarf moved alongside Terenure on 23 points by beating Cork Con 17-3 at Temple Hill in a repeat of last year’s final. Lansdowne are fourth on 20 points after a 36-11 win over neighbours Old Belvedere at Ollie Campbell Park. Max Deegan stole line-outs and imposed himself, as did Charlie Tector. Ballynahinch are fifth, a point further back, after their 24-3 bonus-point win at Nenagh Ormond, while UCD moved out of the bottom two after a handsome bonus-point win over Young Munster. Curiously, the top two entering round six met in each of the top four divisions. Old Wesley remain first in 1B after a 30-16 win at home to Trinity, as do unbeaten Barnhall in 2A after a 28-10 win at Dungannon. The same goes for unbeaten Galwegians after their seven-try 43-21 win away to UL Bohemians. The same match-up took place in the women’s division on the UL 4G, where champions UL Bohs moved above a dogged Galwegians with a 36-24 win.

Title: Firm friends: Finola Kennedy on a remarkable friendship between the founder of the Legion of Mary and former president WT Cosgrave

Time Published: 2025-11-16T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
A remarkable friendship existed between Frank Duff, the founder of the Legion of Mary, and WT Cosgrave who died 60 years ago on November 16th, 1965. Many tributes followed Cosgrave’s death, including an impressive one from then taoiseach Seán Lemass. Understandably the tributes focused on his public life. But there were other, less well known strands. Among these was Cosgrave’s support for the lay Catholic organisation founded by Duff in 1921, and which today numbers four million active members worldwide. Following school in Blackrock College, Duff entered the Civil Service in the Land Commission where he made a significant contribution to the 1923 Land Act before transferring to the Department of Finance. He identified closely with the Civil Service ethos. In a letter written to Seán Ó Faoláin in August 1944, Duff would write, “My cast of mind is mechanical rather than literary. I was a civil servant.” On Saturday July 15th, 1922, in the middle of the Civil War when ministers and officials were living in Government Buildings in Upper Merrion Street, Duff, accompanied by Father Michael Creedon, a priest in Francis Street parish, obtained an interview with WT Cosgrave, then minister for local government and soon to be president. EP McCarron, secretary of the department of local government, was also present and probably facilitated the meeting. Duff and Fr Creedon were seeking accommodation for homeless women whose alternative was prostitution. The Monto area of Dublin, named after Montgomery Street, since named Foley Street, was such a thriving centre for prostitution and for late-night drinking in shebeens that it merited a mention in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1903. Cosgrave recalled how “Frank and Fr Creedon came to the ante-chamber of the cabinet room while a meeting was in progress – asking to see me. It was then he told me of efforts of Fr Creedon and himself on behalf of these friendless girls”. Cosgrave listened intently and asked them to come back in the morning for his response. On the following morning, Sunday, Duff and Creedon called to Government Buildings where they were given a letter. The letter, in Cosgrave’s handwriting, informed them that premises at 76 Harcourt Street had been placed at their disposal free of rent and taxes. A previous owner of the house was the builder, Batt O’Connor, a close friend of Michael Collins. You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work In 1926 at a time of great poverty and dire housing conditions in Dublin, Mr Cosgrave’s government made available to Duff the premises of the North Dublin Union for use as a hostel for homeless men. The Morning Star, as the hostel was named, was officially opened in the presence of a small number of guests, including president Cosgrave, on March 25th, 1927. In October 1930, the Regina Coeli, a hostel for homeless women and their children, opened beside the Morning Star. Both hostels, which have remained open without interruption since 1927 and 1930 respectively, are served by voluntary workers who are members of the Legion of Mary. In 1930 when Duff had still failed to obtain a meeting with the Archbishop of Dublin, Archbishop Byrne, regarding recognition for the legion, Duff again approached Cosgrave. On this occasion Cosgrave, recognising difficulties with the archdiocese, arranged a meeting with the papal nuncio, Paschal Robinson, who had arrived in Ireland on January 14th, 1930. A handwritten letter – undated, but clearly written shortly after Robinson arrived in Ireland – from Paul Banim, the president’s secretary, to Duff, said: “You are to be in room 58 Shelbourne Hotel at 5 o’clock sharp. The President has made the appointment you sought. Ring me.” At the time the Nunciature in the Phoenix Park was undergoing renovations and Robinson was staying in the Shelbourne. In the year following the Shelbourne meeting, Cosgrave accompanied Duff to the Nunciature on May 7th, 1931, when a proposed Roman trip was discussed. Two weeks later on May 23rd, Duff, accompanied by Monsignor O’Brien from Liverpool, travelled to Rome. In Rome Duff was received in audience by Pope Pius XI, who said that he wished the legion would spread over the world. Thanks to Cosgrave, Duff was received by the pope many years before he was received by his own archbishop in Dublin. [ Flying columnist – Frank McNally on a lightning visit to LeesideOpens in new window ] Duff never forgot his debt to Cosgrave. When Cosgrave’s government was replaced in 1932, he wrote to Cosgrave, “You have won the deep respect of all and you have made Ireland respected everywhere. Personally I could not possibly express the extent of my regard for you and for your work.” According to his son Liam Cosgrave, “The last letter that WT wrote was to Frank Duff the actual day he got his final attack 15th November 1965. He died on 16th.” At the time Duff was in Rome for the Vatican Council. A Requiem Mass was held in Rome, at which the government was represented by then minister for agriculture and fisheries, Charles Haughey. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Paddy McCarthy delighted after vindicating Farrell’s decision to select him against Australia

Full Content:
A first Test in Chicago against the All Blacks, a first Test try a week later against Japan and a first Test start against Australia. Paddy McCarthy has arrived as an Irish international and how. On Saturday night he utterly vindicated the faith placed in him by Andy Farrell and the Irish coaches with a 47-minute showing which all his coaches and team-mates through the ranks had long since envisaged. First and foremost McCarthy – immovable while staying square – had the upper hand on his side of the scrum against Allan Alaalatoa, which was the platform for two of Ireland’s first three tries. He put in a shift defensively with nine tackles, while giving a glimpse of his bull-like carries. “Yeah I was happy,” he said afterwards. “Scrum was good. There were mistakes there that I need to brush up on, but happy enough as it’s international rugby and it’s not going to go perfectly. Happy with how I’m going and thankfully I’m not injured or anything, that’s always good.” Yet again, another Farrell fast-tracking hunch is working out. As with older brother Joe, whom the coach blooded at the age of 21 in the November clash with Australia three years ago, the Ireland coach recognises their raw power. “My brother was telling me there’s very few times where you get a packed-out Aviva, there’s not many moments that it comes around. Even if you have a long career, it’s still very special every time you’re playing in the Aviva.” Talking about his brother’s influence, the young McCarthy said: “He’s massive. Equally, when I’m out and he’s in, I’ll help him in any way I can. We’re great friends, he’s my best friend. It’s nice. “I can’t believe I was playing Australia today. I went over to Australia and I remember watching the first Test and having a pint, just like in a Lions jersey, watching it. I can’t believe playing a guy like James O’Connor, all those guys. There’s some great players in the Australian team so it’s kind of surreal, to be honest. It was cool.” Not out of character, it has to be said, there was also one daft penalty for needless use of a hand on the deck in a ruck under the nose of referee Karl Dickson. Oh Paddy. But it’s the McCarthy edge which Farrell also likes, citing how he left an indelible impression on him when he was part of the under-20s squad which the team trained against three seasons ago and seemingly caused all sorts of carnage. “Some of it’s probably true, some of it’s not that true,” he said with a sheepish grin. “I don’t know. It was funny. I was probably a bit of an idiot in the Under 20s anyway. I was really revved up. I probably toned things down a little bit as I got into the senior environment, just chilled out in a good way. Obviously, still adding to the game, but just focusing on my role a bit more. “It was cool training against the senior squad. It was kind of funny. Obviously, I idolised Johnny [Sexton]. I thought I was being friendly, but I think he took it as me being cheeky or something. He kind of fecked me out a bit, but he was grand. It was cool,” said McCarthy. For all the hope through his Blackrock, Trinity and Irish Under-20s days, McCarthy still hadn’t made a start for Leinster until this season and despite being in the squad, missed out on a first cap against either Georgia or Portugal. He didn’t envisage this. “I wasn’t sure if I’d be playing for Ireland or not. I know when the squad came out, I thought I was in the A squad. When the message came in, it was ‘ANS squad’. I didn’t know it was ‘Autumn Nations’, I thought it was A squad or A national squad,” he revealed. “I was like, I’ll just take what I get and play as much as possible. But I was happy out. I was very happy that the coaches, Fogs, Pauly and Faz, put a lot of confidence in me when I came in; more than I expected. “I didn’t think I would get a start in this window because in the summer, I didn’t even play in the Ireland squad. So, to actually get a start and being told I was going well, in the scrums and things like that, it was nice.” A fourth cap against the Springboks would top off a slightly surreal month, but he remains humble. “Yeah, I’d love that. There is good competition and unfortunately Jack Boyle hasn’t got a run out yet and we’re still young and both learning. I’ll take what I can get and if I get to play again, I’d love it. If not, whatever, I’ll do it with the squad.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Australia net zero target: Energy companies warn sidelining renewables will raise power bills

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Australia’s biggest energy companies have reinforced their support for the government’s 2050 net zero target and warned that failing to embrace renewables will only send power bills higher, contradicting a key Coalition argument as it fights to wind back climate action. Liberal leader Sussan Ley, who formally ditched the Coalition’s support for net zero on Sunday, has revived claims that renewable energy and emissions targets will impose unaffordable costs on households. Most of Australia’s remaining coal-fired power plants are due to close within the next 10 years as they face frequent equipment faults, soaring maintenance costs and intense competition from renewables.Credit: Paul Jones If elected, the Coalition would also dismantle Labor’s interim climate targets, abolish electric vehicle incentives and extend taxpayer funds to keep coal-fired power stations running longer or support the construction of new ones, she said. But in a report to be released on Monday, the chief executives of more than a dozen major electricity suppliers, including AGL, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, who are all members of the Australian Energy Council, rejected calls to ditch net zero and insisted that shifting to a mostly renewable grid was the best way to keep bills as low as possible. The chief executives emphasised the need for “policy certainty and stability” as Australia neared a critical juncture in the energy transition. While coal-fired power stations still supply more than half of the nation’s electricity needs, most of them are approaching the end of their usable lives and are due to be retired before 2035, meaning they must be urgently replaced regardless of net zero ambitions, they said. ‘In the long run, this approach [renewables] will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation.’ In 2022, AGL brought forward the closure of its Bayswater coal plant in NSW to no later than 2033, while the retirement of the Loy Yang A generator in Victoria was fast-tracked by up to 10 years to 2035. Origin Energy originally intended to retire Eraring, the nation’s largest coal plant, in 2032, but now plans to shut it in 2027. The anti-net zero bloc: Jessica Collins, Angus Taylor, Sarah Henderson, Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price arrive with other Liberals for their party room showdown on Wednesday.Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The industry argues the cheapest path for consumers is to invest in replacing ageing coal generators with firmed-up renewable energy, rather than forcing the extensions of ageing and increasingly unreliable plants, which can break down with no notice and cause huge price rises, or building new coal-fired facilities. “The least-cost, lowest-impact pathway is an energy system dominated by renewables and firmed by battery storage, gas and pumped hydro,” the chief executives said. However, the Australian Energy Council stresses that replacing ageing power stations is “not costless”, and will push up people’s electricity bills – at least for a while. Building more wind and solar farms, large-scale storage projects and thousands of kilometres of extra pylons and power lines to stitch together a bigger and more complex grid will all add to costs that need to be passed on to consumers, it said. The report noted that electricity prices had “never been under more pressure” due to heavy investments needed to replace and decarbonise ageing generation assets. It called for a more open and honest dialogue about what the energy transition would cost homes and businesses. “I think it’s the calm before the storm,” one chief executive said. In particular, network costs to maintain and upgrade transmission infrastructure, which account for about a third of a customer’s bill, are expected to increase significantly in the coming years. The CSIRO calculates that a new coal-fired power plant, using modern technology to keep emissions down as much as possible, would produce electricity for between $111 and $178 a megawatt hour – at a midpoint of $145. Power from renewables in a mostly renewable grid, meanwhile, would cost between $116 and $165 a megawatt hour (a midpoint of $141), which also factors in the billions of dollars in additional costs such as paying for batteries, gas and transmission lines. Once built and operating, renewables were among the lowest-cost sources of energy, Australian Energy Council chief executive Louisa Kinnear said. “But we still need to account for the costs of constructing new supply and adopting our existing system to accommodate and firm up low emissions, intermittent sources,” she said. “In the long run, this approach will still be cheaper than continuing to invest in existing or new coal-fired power generation, but we need to ensure the transition is managed carefully.” The push to scrap the commitment to net zero by 2050 and weaken interim climate targets would breach the conditions of the Paris Agreement, which Australia signed up to in 2016. Large investors, who have been pouring billions of dollars into green energy projects across Australia, described the Coalition’s backdown as “material and disappointing”. “However, the fundamentals remain,” said Clean Energy Investor Group chief executive Richie Merzian, who represents funds including US-based BlackRock, France’s Neoen and Australia’s Macquarie Bank. “New generation is required, clean energy is the best path for returns, and the current government is committed to supporting that.” Debby Blakey, chief executive of the $100 billion superannuation giant HESTA, which invests heavily in the energy transition, said bipartisan support for climate targets including net zero was important for investors to know that policies would remain stable. “This is critical given investors commit capital over very long time frames for investments like energy infrastructure,” she said. “Attracting global private capital to invest in Australia’s transition is underpinned by long-term policy certainty.” The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Title: Sublease crisis winding down in latest sign of NYC office recovery

The wind’s gone out of the great sublease balloon that supposedly spelled doom for the city’s office market. Manhattan office sublease availability has fallen to less than in 2019, according to Transwestern — down to just 11.8 million square feet in the third quarter, compared to 12.3 million before the start of the pandemic and a high of 23 million in early 2023. But wait — wasn’t the sublease “glut” going to wreck the progress that was made since COVID-19 ravaged the economy? CoStar News in April 2023 cited a Savills warning that, “Companies putting spaces up for sublease reached an all-time high of 22.4 million square feet in the first quarter,” or 24.6% of all Manhattan office availability at the time. An even gloomier essay posted on The City in May 2023 described Big Apple office market “deterioration” due to “scores” of empty buildings, high interest rates, $16 billion in outstanding debt, sublease volume, and the usual bogeyman of work-from-home. Now, however, Transwestern reports that sublease offerings have fallen to 18% of Manhattan availability. Most spaces still up for grabs were smaller than 25,000 square feet, although a few large blocks remained. “We’ve been keeping an eye on the sublease levels for a few years now, first as they ballooned during the height of the pandemic, and with optimistic expectation as they slowly subsided over the past few quarters,” said Transwestern research manager Corrie Slewett. “It’s a notable milestone that Manhattan’s available sublet space has settled below the pre-pandemic levels,” Slewett added. Recent, large sublease deflations included Paramount Global, which last month yanked 92,5000 square feet from availability at 1515 Broadway. Large absorption deals included Blackrock’s 193,000 square feet from Meta at 50 Hudson Yards; Robinhood’s 125,400 square-foot sublease from MSG at 2 Penn; and Sixth Street Partners’ 103,400 square feet from Pfizer at The Spiral. CBRE global brokerage head Stephen B. Siegel commented, “The market is on fire and the absorption of sublease space is a natural by-product of that. The reduction is attributable both to tenants expanding and others deciding to keep space they previously planned to give up.”

Title: Harvard’s Bitcoin Bag Swells: Spot BTC ETF Holdings Climb 257% In Q3

Bitcoin has enjoyed attention as one of the most rewarding stores of value in recent years, with institutional adoption reaching new highs this year. One such landmark Bitcoin acquisition was made by Harvard University, arguably the world’s most prestigious academic institution. Earlier in August, Harvard disclosed an investment portfolio containing $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as of the end of Q2. According to its latest disclosure, the university’s BTC exposure nearly tripled over the last quarter. In its latest 13F filing, Harvard University revealed that it held 6,813,612 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) valued at approximately $443 million as of September 30. This additional acquisition highlights the institution’s expansive capital allocation strategy, which also saw its SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) holdings grow to 661,391 shares (worth approximately $235 million) in 2025 Q3. Notably, Harvard’s current holding of the leading spot BTC ETF represents a 257% increase from the disclosed 1,906,000 shares declared as of June. As of now, BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund is the single largest investment of the university’s reported holdings. While the current IBIT position makes only a small portion of Harvard’s endowment of $57 billion, it is significant enough to make the university the 16th-largest IBIT holder. As inferred earlier, stories of institutional adoption such as this further add credence to Bitcoin’s status as a strategic reserve asset and the growing demand for exchange-traded funds. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X: It’s super rare/difficult to get an endowment to bite on an ETF- esp a Harvard or Yale, it’s as good a validation as an ETF can get. That said, half a billion is a mere 1% of total endowment. Big enough to rank 16th among IBIT holders tho. The US-based Bitcoin ETFs have suffered waning investor demand in recent weeks, with the past week particularly disappointing. According to the latest market data, the exchange-traded funds registered a total net outflow of $1.1 billion in the past week. Leading these withdrawals was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which is currently on a three-day outflow streak. Data from SoSoValue shows that $463.1 million flowed out of the BTC ETF on Friday, November 14. As of this writing, BlackRock’s IBIT still ranks as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with net assets worth roughly $74.98 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

A JUDGE HAS stated it will be alleged that a former sales associate with high end retail brands in Dublin “was caught red handed” with two suitcases containing €620,000 worth of cannabis by the carousel at Shannon airport last week. At Ennis District Court, Judge Alec Gabbett made his comment in the case where Sean Grehan (28) of Stradbrook Park, Blackrock, Dublin appeared in court after being charged with two alleged drugs offences arising from the airport seizure last Wednesday. At the conclusion of a contested bail hearing, Judge Gabbett remanded Grehan in custody with consent to bail on condition that Grehan provide a €20,000 cash surety. Counsel for Grehan, Sorcha Dianamh Ní Néill Fulham BL, told Judge Gabbett that her client “doesn’t have cash at present”. Gardaí objected to bail and Garda Kevin Molloy said that it will be alleged that a passenger from an inbound Boston flight, Sean Grehan, was detected by customs officers to have two 20kg suitcases at Shannon airport last Wednesday containing 31kg of cannabis with an estimated street value of €620,000. Garda Molloy said that it will be alleged that Grehan was due to pass the two suitcases to another person after getting through customs at Shannon airport. Garda Molloy said that gardaí were objecting to bail based on the seriousness of the charge and the strength of evidence against Mr Grehan in the case. Advertisement Garda Molloy said that Grehan by his own admission has incurred a significant drugs debt due to his addiction to cocaine “and admitted that he has taken a serious amount of cocaine over the last number of years”. Garda Molloy said that the suspected cannabis is to be tested at the Forensic Science Ireland (FSI). Judge Gabbett said that it will be alleged that Grehan “was caught red handed at the carousel at Shannon airport with two suit-cases full of drugs”. In response, Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that this would be a matter for evidence. Ms Ní Néill Fulham said that her client is a father of two children, aged seven and five, and has worked as a sales associate for a number of high end retail brands in Dublin. Ms Ní Néill Fulham expressed concern that if Grehan was to be remanded in custody the length of time it is taking FSI to test for drugs currently. In the case, Grehan is charged with at Shannon airport on November 12th having in his possession, cannabis for the purpose of sale or supply contrary to Section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.

Title: Harvard University boosts its BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investment to $442.8m

About us Copy link The Ivy League has given Bitcoin exchange-traded funds another seal of approval, with Harvard University bolstering the size of its holdings by almost 260%. That’s according to disclosures in a Harvard Management Company filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The Harvard Management Company, launched in 1974, manages Harvard University’s endowment and other financial assets, making stock market investments on the university’s behalf. The filing shows that, as of its latest filing, the company’s holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, were worth $442.8 million. As of September 30, Harvard University owned 6.81 million IBIT shares. The university’s financial managers made their first IBIT investment in the second quarter of FY2025, taking up a $116.7 million position in the BlackRock-run Bitcoin ETF. In August, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst noted that “endowments are the hardest institution to hook,” as “they rarely bite on ETFs.” This trend appears to have been turned on its head. The dollar value of Harvard’s BTC ETF investment dwarfs the combined total of its holdings in the blue-chip tech stocks Meta, NVIDIA, and the Google operator Alphabet. The filing also shows that IBIT is Harvard’s biggest ETF purchase, and its largest single investment in terms of dollar worth. And Harvard is not the only member of the Ivy League buying up Bitcoin ETF shares. SEC data shows that Brown University owns 212,500 IBIT shares, worth $13,007,125 when it filed with the SEC on August 8. The Harvard filing, meanwhile, also shows that the university’s fund managers are turning to gold. They have snapped up 661,391 shares in the gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares. Harvard’s holdings in gold shares are worth $235 million. The rest of Harvard’s portfolio is primarily made up of tech stocks. The university holds significant positions in firms like Microsoft, as well as the chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom. It also holds stocks in the gambling giants Light & Wonder and Flutter Entertainment. Pension funds across the United States have begun buying Bitcoin ETF shares in recent years. But sell-offs have also become increasingly common. Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s Investment Board sold the entirety of its $300 million holdings in the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. This month has also seen some investors liquidate their holdings. On November 8, the CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn noted that Bitcoin ETF flows have “dropped by about $2.3 billion from their peak.” This marks the “largest outflow since May 2025,” he added. May saw investors withdraw a total of $4.8 billion from Bitcoin ETFs. Tim Alper is a news correspondent at DL News. Got a tip? Email at tdalper@dlnews.com.

Title: How much is $10k invested in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF at launch worth today?

By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A $10,000 wager on BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) at launch would be worth $19,870 today, nearly double the return of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, and edging past gold’s own stellar run. However, that 98.7% gain masks the bigger picture that, for several months in 2025, IBIT holders were sitting on returns exceeding 150%, watching their initial stake balloon past $25,000 before Bitcoin’s recent stumble below six figures pulled those gains back to earth. The comparison isn’t close when measured over the 22-month window since IBIT’s Jan. 5, 2024, inception. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both delivered respectable returns of 42-43%, an impressive feat given that they posted back-to-back years of 25% or more, a rarity that has occurred only three times since 1871. Gold, driven by geopolitical anxiety and central bank buying, came closest with gains of 92-93%. Yet Bitcoin’s trajectory carved a different path entirely, one defined less by steady compounding than by violent swings that rewarded conviction and punished hesitation. By Sept. 30, that same $10,000 IBIT position had reached approximately $25,000, translating to a 150% return in under two years, according to a BlackRock filing with the SEC. Bitcoin traded near $115,000 per coin by then, IBIT shares hovered around that level, and the narrative shifted from “institutional adoption” to “how high can this go?” The 2.5x milestone represented not just arithmetic success but psychological vindication for allocators who endured skepticism about crypto’s place in portfolios governed by Sharpe ratios and correlation matrices. Then came October, and Bitcoin registered a new all-time high above $126,000, with IBIT shares priced at $71,29, before sliding through its short-term holder cost basis. The movement triggered cascading liquidations across futures markets, and the leverage that amplified the climb accelerated the descent. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at $96,612.79, and IBIT traded at $54.84, making those September highs look like a mirage. The drawdown from peak erased roughly $6,000 in paper value per initial $10,000 invested, a reminder that Bitcoin’s uncorrelated returns cut both ways. The equity indices delivered a textbook performance: the S&P 500 achieved its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, and the Nasdaq 100, propelled by the “Magnificent Seven,” saw earnings growth averaging 21.6% year-over-year. Both suffered manageable drawdowns, traded within established ranges, and validated decades of mean-reversion research. Gold’s 52% year-to-date surge through November 2025 stemmed from macroeconomic dislocation, fueled by tariff uncertainty, Fed pause dynamics, and record central bank purchases, rather than speculative mania. Its correlation to equities stayed negative, fulfilling its portfolio role as designed. IBIT offered none of that predictability, with a 98.7% gain since inception deriving from a single-asset bet on a protocol with no earnings, no dividends, and no intrinsic cash flow to discount. The volatility that allowed a 150% peak also permitted a 25% collapse in weeks. Traditional risk models would categorize that profile as unacceptable, and traditional risk-adjusted returns would penalize the path even as they acknowledged the destination. Yet, the path matters less than the outcome for capital deployed at inception. The investor who bought IBIT on day one and held through the September peak, the November pullback, and every subsequent liquidation cascade still outperformed every major benchmark by a margin wide enough to survive transaction costs, tax drag, and multiple moments of doubt. That investor also experienced standard deviation in returns that would make compliance officers flinch and risk committees demand explanations. IBIT’s performance doesn’t just reflect Bitcoin’s price appreciation, it captures the infrastructure that’s been built around crypto as an asset class instead. Spot ETF approval removed custody risk for institutions allergic to private keys and hardware wallets. BlackRock’s brand provided regulatory air cover. The CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate gave auditors a benchmark they could defend. Together, these developments transformed Bitcoin from “digital gold held by ideologues” into “trackable exposure tradeable through Schwab.” That wrapper mattered when Bitcoin tested six figures. ETF inflows of $1.2 billion exiting in November didn’t represent panic, but rather rebalancing, profit-taking, and tactical repositioning by allocators who could now treat Bitcoin like any other liquid asset. The same pipes that channeled $37 billion into IBIT over its first year also allowed nearly $900 million to exit on a single day on Nov. 13, without breaking the market. Liquidity is the tax that professionals pay for access, and IBIT’s structure efficiently collects that tax. The futures markets told the rest of the story. Open interest swelled to $235 billion by mid-October before contracting as long positions unwound. Funding rates remained subdued even as prices tested support, indicating that traders had de-risked rather than doubled down. Options skew favored puts by 11% in implied volatility, pricing protection against sub-$100K tests that arrived on schedule. The infrastructure didn’t prevent volatility. It simply made volatility tradeable, insurable, and therefore tolerable for capital that demands both. Comparing IBIT to the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 assumes they’re solving for the same mandate, which they’re not. Equity indices provide exposure to aggregate corporate earnings growth, diversified across sectors, with governance structures and disclosure requirements that mitigate downside risk. IBIT offers exposure to a fixed-supply monetary protocol with no recourse, no management team to fire, and no quarterly guidance to parse. The former compounds through dividend reinvestment and multiple expansion, while the latter compounds through network effects and adoption curves that either validate the thesis or don’t. Gold sits closer to the spectrum, with no cash flows, no earnings, valued for its scarcity and institutional acceptance. However, gold’s 5,000-year history as a store of value gives it mean-reversion characteristics that Bitcoin lacks. When gold rallies by 50% in a year, the assumption is that it will revert to its long-term average. When Bitcoin rallies 150%, the assumption is either a paradigm shift or speculative excess, with no consensus on which. That uncertainty is the premium IBIT investors pay for asymmetry. The 98.7% return since inception, the peak in October, and the 25% drawdown since all reflect the fact that Bitcoin’s volatility is an inherent asset characteristic, not a bug to engineer away. The institutions that purchased IBIT were aware of this. The 19-month outperformance against traditional benchmarks compensated them for enduring it. Whether that trade continues to work depends less on Fed policy or ETF flows than on whether enough capital decides that the volatility is worth the option value embedded in a non-sovereign, programmatically scarce bearer asset. For the investor who placed $10,000 into IBIT at launch and now holds $19,870, the answer is already clear. For the one who sold at nearly $25,000 in September, the answer is more precise still. And for the allocator still running Monte Carlo simulations on the role of crypto in a 60/40 portfolio, the question remains open. And this is exactly why the returns appear as they do.

Title: Americans have plenty of excuses for not investing. None of them stand up to this simple piece of advice from Warren Buffett.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. More than one-third of Americans do not own stocks, and a new BlackRock survey reveals that the holdouts cite a lot of reasons for not being in the market. In its People & Money report published on Thursday, BlackRock listed some of the reasons people who don't invest say they stay on the sidelines. Among the most common are not having enough money, not feeling like they know enough about investing, and being afraid of losses. Those are all fair explanations for not putting your money to work. But there is one simple piece of advice from investing icon Warren Buffett that offers a solution to each one of them: invest in an S&P 500 index fund, a product that tracks the performance of roughly the 500 largest stocks in the US. "Over the years, I've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I've learned a good deal about human behavior," Buffett said in his 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. "My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund." So, let's go through each of the above reasons, starting with the toughest: not having enough money. If you've never done it, investing is something that can feel like you need thousands of dollars saved up to start. In reality, there are some very low-cost entry points. For example, the Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) trades at around $17 a share. You can also buy fractional shares of funds that trade at a higher price level, but it's more or less all the same in the end. While investing small amounts may seem futile, it's more about getting started and building habits — after a few years, if you keep at it, you'll have built up a chunk of money thanks to both your contributions and compounding returns. Second: not feeling like you know enough about investing. Financial markets can feel daunting, but like anything, once you do it, it gets easier. Plus, the beauty about buying an index fund is that you don't really need to know much about investing. Your money will passively sit in a diversified group of stocks for years. If you really feel that you have questions that need to be addressed, however, you can always visit a physical branch of an advisor like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, said Chris Chen, a certified financial planner and founder of Insight Financial Strategists. "They have people at the counter there who are waiting for them to invest their money and answer their questions, and they're basically free," Chen told Business Insider. Finally: being afraid that you'll lose money. It's what keeps even the most successful investors up at night. But the reality is that, if you have a long-term time horizon and resist the urge to sell at the first sign of trouble, the S&P 500 has historically recovered from its pullbacks. Earlier this year, Yale economist William Goetzmann told Business Insider that investors tend to overestimate the odds of an imminent stock market crash and tend to forget that such crashes don't last. Goetzmann's research shows that when the market plunges after a big period of returns, there's a 99% chance those losses have been recovered five years later. "If you wait five years after this event, you're going to be better off. That's what I'm telling you," he said. Of course, S&P 500 index funds aren't the only products out there. Jason Draho, the head of asset allocation Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, said that he would rather people invest in an all-world index fund — one example would be Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) — as S&P 500 valuations are high and the index is heavily concentrated in a select few stocks. US stocks have outperformed the rest of the world over the last decade and a half. Since the March 2009 market lows, the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF is up 423% while the S&P 500 is up 800%. So far this year, however, the US has underperformed international stocks, and some Wall Street analysts see global markets beating the US in the coming years. There's also something to be said about the visibility of the S&P 500 — it's the benchmark that US investors tend to follow, and you can track its performance on the nightly news. But in the end, it doesn't matter all that much — it's more about getting the ball rolling. "The important part for someone who is just starting is to start," Chen said. Jump to

Title: The Harvard Endowment’s Biggest Public Investment is Now Bitcoin

Reading time 3 minutes According to a new SEC filing, the Harvard University endowmentâs largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report.Â At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoinâs price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. Bitcoin is now Harvard’s largest reportable public investment. Larger than Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and others. See link below for the list.Of course Harvard’s total endowment is much larger and includes private investments that aren’t publicly reported. But yesterday’s BTCâ¦ https://t.co/OsV0XFAb6N In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Googleâs parent company).Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowmentâs holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters, the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowmentâs holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, itâs definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments.According to Forbes, Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities.Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others.These endowment funds tend to be focused on long-term, fundamental value rather than short-term trades based around temporary hype. And interest in bitcoin from these sorts of funds focused on longer timeframes more generally has continued to develop over time. In addition to university endowments, various state pension funds everywhere from Michigan to Florida also have exposure to bitcoin via spot ETFs or bitcoin treasury company Strategy. Bitcoin exposure can also be found in the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi, Norway, and other nations. ðºð¸ NEW: 14 US states have reported $632m in $MSTR exposure for Q1, in public retirement and treasury funds.A collective increase of $302m in one quarter. The average increase in holding size was 44%. pic.twitter.com/0PKm1avcPR Nation-states, Fortune 500 companies, central banks, and other large entities are also increasingly viewing bitcoin as a reserve asset in place of U.S. treasuries, gold, or other alternatives. Just this past week, the Czech National Bank announced its first bitcoin purchase for the purpose of evaluating the potential addition of the crypto asset to their international reserves, despite objections from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.Of course, the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve was also a campaign promise made by now President Donald Trump, but such a reserve has yet to materialize.While those more aligned with Bitcoinâs original cypherpunk ethos are becoming increasingly worried about the extremely prevalent use of third-party bitcoin custodians by the vast majority of these large institutions, this type of adoption does at least still enable the intended removal of trust in terms of the crypto assetâs underlying, unwavering monetary policy. However, there still seems to be plenty of work to be done when it comes to other cypherpunk values, such as the decentralization of payments and financial privacy, as illustrated by the crypto industryâs heavy embrace of stablecoins.

There was drama in the top of the table clash in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League as Terenure College won the D6W derby against St Mary’s College 14-12 in a tense, tactical affair at Lakelands. Tries from John McKee and Oisín McCormack, both converted by Chris Cosgrave, gave Nure just enough breathing room to survive four Mick O’Gara penalties. Defending champions Clontarf picked up a 17-3 win away to Cork Constitution at Temple Hill in a repeat of last season’s decider. Fionn Gilbert’s brace, one in each half, proved the catalyst, Conor Kelly added two conversions and a penalty. Con’s sole reply came from an Aidan Moynihan penalty deep in the first half. UCD climbed out of the drop zone with a 34-12 bonus-point win over Young Munster in Belfield. A quickfire Evan Moynihan double before half-time set the tone, and second-half tries from Michael O’Reilly, Dan Barron, and Daniel Hurley pushed the Students comfortably clear. Lansdowne surged to a 36-11 victory at Old Belvedere. Andy Marks and Bobby Sheehan both crossed twice, with George Morris adding a fifth try deep into stoppage time. Charlie Tector contributed five conversions and a penalty from the tee. Belvo stayed in sight during the first half through Daragh O’Dwyer’s penalties and an Andre Ryan try, but couldn’t contain Lansdowne in the second half. Ballynahinch impressed again in a 24-3 win away to Nenagh Ormond, scoring twice in each half with Tom McAllister, Aaron Sexton, Bradley Luney and Sam Warwick all crossing for tries In Division 1B, Garryowen produced a strong second-half push to win 29-15 away to City of Armagh, with Fionn Rowsome grabbing a clinical hat-trick. Instonians turned things around late on to defeat Highfield 17-15, while Naas overturned a half-time deficit to beat Blackrock College 32-20.

In 2B, Galwegians delivered an empathetic 43-21 win against UL Bohemian in their top of the table clash, Clogher Valley struck twice late on to beat Enniscorthy, while Skerries also struck late against Buccaneers to win 25-23. Malone claimed a strong 35-19 win at Sligo, while Rainey picked up a valuable 19-10 away win against Navan In 2C, Monkstown once again came out on top against Ballyclare, winning 43-34 in a high-scoring affair, Belfast Harlequins held off Midleton, Clonmel ended Thomond’s unbeaten start, Malahide recorded their first win of the season, while Bective Rangers picked up a win away to Dolphin, 20 years after their last meeting ended in defeat. In the Energia All-Ireland Junior Cup quarter-finals, Athy, Creggs and Dromore all booked their place in the semi-final, while Seapoint and Wicklow will meet in two weeks to determine who joins them, as their game was postponed due to the rainfall. In the Women’s Division, holders UL Bohemian held off a spirited Galwegians side 36-24 to move top and remain unbeaten, with Chloe Pearse crossing for a hat-trick. Blackrock continued their winning form with a 60-5 win over Tullow. Robyn O’Connor crossed for four tries as Old Belvedere defeated Ballincollig 65-7 in another statement win, while Railway Union were sharp in a 48-7 success over Wicklow, Heidi Lyons and Claire Boles crossing for braces.

More than half of low- and middle-income Americans now invest in capital markets, according to new research by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, a financial nonprofit. And a majority of those less-affluent investors, with household incomes ranging from $30,000 to $80,000, started investing in the past 5 years. In prior generations, owning stocks often meant you had a broker and a lot of money. Even today, the top 1% of wealthy Americans owns half of all stock, federal data shows. But technological leaps and industry shifts have dramatically lowered the bar for entering the market. Nowadays, just about anyone can buy in. “The entry barriers are lower,” said Timothy Flacke, CEO of Commonwealth. “You can start with 50 dollars or, in many cases, a dollar, and a smartphone. That matters.” Stock tips used to circulate in highbrow finance magazines and subscription newsletters as well as country-club golf courses. Today, anyone with internet access can summon an avalanche of investment advice with a simple Google search. YouTube and TikTok brim with investment influencers. And buying stock has never been easier. Online platforms allow consumers to purchase shares without the aid of brokers or the burden of fees. For the price of a coffee, you can own a piece of the market. “These days, no brokerages charge commissions, and many of them allow for fractional shares,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser and financial planning expert at The Motley Fool. “You can invest as little as 5 dollars, in some cases, and get a portion of a share of Nvidia or Microsoft.” The report from BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, published Oct. 13, draws from a nationally representative survey of more than 2,750 Americans, all from households with low or moderate incomes. It’s part of a larger initiative to study the flood of new investors into the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, individual investors opened 46 million new brokerage accounts. The pandemic inspired many Americans to try their hand at investing: They were stuck in their homes, spending less and amassing savings, partly thanks to the federal stimulus effort. “There were some folks who found themselves either with more cash or with more time,” Flacke said. For middle-class Americans, stocks and real estate have served as gateways to the American Dream, rewarding a modest investment with a lifetime of capital gains. In recent years, however, spiraling home prices and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. The stock market, with no minimum investment, remains a viable alternative for building wealth. “A lot of younger people and a lot of lower-income people have not been able to buy their way into the housing market,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. “But they have been able to build their net worth by investing in the stock market, and by owning individual stocks.” As a tool for building wealth, the stock market has done an admirable job of advertising itself. The S&P 500 rose by 261% over the past decade, climbing at an annual rate of 13.6%, according to The Motley Fool. “With a few exceptions, the market has been on an extraordinary tear over the last 10-15 years,” Brokamp said. “That just attracts more attention, and more people invest.” In time, rising stock ownership among lower-income Americans could chip away at historic wealth disparities. In the first quarter of 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans by net worth owned just 1% of all stocks, according to a Motley Fool analysis. With many more lower- and middle-income consumers owning stocks, perhaps their portfolios will eventually grow. “Americans are very good at being consumers,” Silver said. “But they’re also becoming better at being owners, owners of the companies that they’re spending money on.” Lower-income investors have much the same aspirations as higher-income Americans, according to the BlackRock report. Survey respondents cited these as their top investment goals: The survey does not include 401(k) accounts, IRAs and other tax-favored investments. It focuses on consumers investing through standard brokerage accounts. The survey found that newer investors are more likely to own individual stocks, rather than mutual funds or ETFs. That could be a problem. All stocks are volatile, and individual stocks are generally more mercurial than mutual funds and ETFs, which often mirror the performance of a stock or bond index. “My personal preference is for people to start with index funds and then move into individual stocks,” Brokamp said. “But it looks like the opposite is happening now.” The survey suggests new investors “are really hungry for information about how to diversify” their investments, said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “One of the things the industry can do is meet people where they are.” The financial services industry could help new investors, for example, by encouraging more households to open emergency savings accounts, Chamberlain said. A recent analysis by Investopedia found that the average American family should have at least $35,000 in emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses. Emergency savings deliver financial security. Without savings, a lower-income family is more apt to cash out an investment account if a car breaks down or the roof leaks. “One of the things that this survey revealed is the importance of having emergency savings,” Chamberlain said, “to support the investor’s ability to stay the course.”

Title: BlackRock Launches Expansion Of $2.5 Billion BUIDL Fund Into Binance And BNB Chain

Securitize and Binance have jointly announced on Friday that the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) will now be accepted as off-exchange collateral for trading on Binance. Fortune reported that the collaboration with Binance is expected to boost the popularity of BUIDL, a token launched by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, last year. Since its inception, BUIDL has witnessed significant growth, with its market capitalization exceeding $2.5 billion. Functioning akin to a stablecoin, BUIDL is commonly utilized as collateral for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, catering primarily to large institutional investors like private equity firms and hedge funds that make a minimum investment of $5 million into the BlackRock BUIDL fund. What sets BUIDL apart from traditional stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) is its unique feature of distributing the yield collected from its reserves to investors. Currently offering a yield of around 4%, BlackRock imposes a management fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% on the token. To bring BUIDL into existence, BlackRock collaborates with Securitize, a company specializing in issuing digital assets. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, highlighted the growing popularity of tokenized assets due to their ability to facilitate quick and efficient trade settlements. Domingo emphasized the “antiquated nature” of current capital market ledgers, often built on outdated software, contrasting this with the “agile and near-instant settlement capabilities” of blockchain technology. Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP & Institutional, noted that the addition of BUIDL was driven partly by customer demand. She noted in the statement: Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements. Concurrently, BUIDL is set to introduce a new share class on the BNB Chain network, enhancing investor reach and interoperability with other blockchain financial applications. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL marked BlackRock’s inaugural tokenized fund on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and seamless peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds upon BUIDL’s presence across networks like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), and Solana (SOL), further enhancing its accessibility and utility within the blockchain ecosystem. When writing, Binance’s native token, BNB, trades at $931.60, recording losses exceeding 20% in the past 30 days. This positions Binance Coin 32% below all-time high levels of $1,369 reached back in October of this year.

Title: After Lions tour and last Autumn Nations, Wallabies ‘now well versed with Ireland players’

It’s 7.50am on Friday. The high-pitched whine is an audible reminder of the wind that buffets the doors of the Radisson hotel in Stillorgan, Co Dublin; the slanting rain being the second element in a two-pronged assault. A seagull seeks shelter under an awning. Joe Schmidt bids farewell to a friend in the lobby, stopping briefly for a chat. Australia will soon make the short hop to Blackrock for their Captain’s Run. Upstairs, Wallabies skipper Harry Wilson holds court, an engaging interviewee. There are no Australian journalists present, instead a couple take to the online portal. It’ll be a slow day in every respect, once the on-pitch run-though is over. Coffee and Netflix get a mention, the staples for a team confined to base. Both Wilson and Schmidt mentioned last year’s clash between the countries, a game the Wallabies led until the final eight minutes, when Ireland pilfered a 22-19 win. Andy Farrell’s side have eight survivors in the run-on team, Australia, nine, so there are enough points of difference not to get bogged down by historical reference. Wilson pointed out that between last November’s meeting and the Lions series the Wallabies have become well versed with the Ireland players. Wilson was asked about one of them, Jack Conan. “He’s a really good ball carrier, a strong ball carrier, which you definitely felt during that Lions series. He’s quite good in the lineout too, got a good jump on him, so I think he’ll definitely help their lineout,” he said. “When you have a player like Caelan Doris move to seven, they’re going to have a lot of good ball carriers in their backrow. That’s a really big point for us where our backrow is going to have to step up and try and stop them there because they’ve obviously picked quite a big one. But I think it’s always exciting when you get to go up against three quality backrows.” Three kilometres down the road at the Aviva Stadium it was a case of “right back at you” as Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, was asked about the Aussie loose trio and in particular the indefatigable Fraser McReight. “Set piece is a big focus area,” Doris said. “Scrum and lineout, how we show up there. Breakdown-wise, I’m obviously playing seven [and] up against McReight, who’s been world-class over the last couple of years. I think he was top poacher in the Rugby Championship and contests a ton of balls. So, breakdown is going to be a big point. “He’s [McReight] extremely fit. His work-rate is almost unparalleled. We saw a clip of him, I think it was the 76th minute of a game a few weeks back. He makes a tackle, gets off the ground, chases, gets on the end of a ball and scores a try. His stats each game are very high. “He has got a good skill set as well, he’s a good footballer and has the ability to play the ball off the line. He’s not the biggest guy, but he carries pretty strongly as well. The standout thing is his work rate.” Doris is unfazed by swapping his traditional role at eight for a crack at openside flanker. He will continue to try to cause chaos at the breakdown. “The first breakdown battle off scrums and lineouts is going to be a difference. Up against McReight, it’s going to be one that I’m looking forward to and need to get right,” he said. There is a sense that both Ireland and Australia are trying to wriggle out from underneath a blanket of criticism in some quarters that decries a level of recent underperformance. The Wallabies are suffering legacy disappointment from Udine and the 26-19 defeat to Italy; Ireland from the 13-26 defeat to the All Blacks in Chicago and a failure to blossom in the opening 40-minutes against Japan. Australia are looking for energy to sustain them through the penultimate game of a long season and better discipline in a broad sense; Ireland for improved accuracy at the set piece and in handling. It’s what is missing rather than what’s there that’s generated the greater angst outside of the respective camps. The final word to Doris. “The World Cup rankings are done in December, so from that point of view it’s massively important but also in terms of continuing the belief and improvement. [To get the result] it’s got to be process-focused, performance-focused, so that is what we are putting our minds towards. It’s the consistency defensively and in what we’re doing in attack that needs to improve this weekend.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Like never before, the Dublin 6W derby has more than just local bragging rights at stake, as second-placed Terenure College host St Mary’s College at Lakelands Park (kick off 3pm) in an Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A summit meeting. St Mary’s arrive with five wins out of five, and 23 points out of a possible 25, while Terenure have won four of their five games to lie second on 21 points. Supporters of both came from far and wide last season when the clubs traded home wins in front of huge crowds for their first AIL derbies in seven years after St Mary’s returned to the top flight. Although some big Leinster names are among those featuring in this full programme of matches – weather permitting – the pity is that Terenure’s brilliant young halfbacks, Fintan Gunne and Caspar Gabriel, were not released. They were central figures to a third successive bonus point when beating high-flying Ballynahinch 52-12 away a fortnight ago. But they have a plethora of skilful, versatile backs and Carlos Spencer moves former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave, who scored a hat-trick in Ballynahinch, to outhalf. Caolan Cooley comes in at left wing, Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver returns, while Leinster have released hooker John McKee, with Oisín McCormack, Max Russell and returning captain Luke Clohessy forming a new backrow. St Mary’s have been boosted by the fitness of their captain/playmaker Conor Dean, injured in their 27-26 win over Con last time, while Mark McHugh brings in winger Aaron O’Sullivan, scrumhalf Colm Reilly and tighthead Mick McCormack as former Munster centre Dan Goggin continues at number eight. Reigning champions Clontarf sit third and travel to Cork Con in a repeat of last season’s final, with the home side in serious need of a win after three successive defeats. ‘Tarf welcome back Dylan O’Grady, Hugh Cooney and Alan Spicer. [ Joe Schmidt back on familiar ground as Wallabies face Ireland in DublinOpens in new window ] Lansdowne, in fourth, renew their age-old rivalry with Old Belvedere in Ollie Campbell Park, with Declan Fassbender’s one change from the side which beat Nenagh 62-17 being a notable one with Leinster’s Max Deegan in at number eight. Belvo make four changes, including Daragh O’Dywer at outhalf. UCD welcome Young Munster, with Andrew Osborne at fullback, while the Cookies welcomes Munster trio Shay McCarthy and halfbacks Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan. Promoted Nenagh Ormond, still winless, host Ballynahinch after contrasting Bateman Cup outings, the latter’s ruthless 78-0 win over Sligo regaining them momentum. Among the home side’s five changes, Charlie O’Doherty start at 10 and captain Kevin O’Flaherty returns at lock. Remarkably, there are also summit meeting in 1B, where leaders Old Wesley host a resurgent Trinity; in 2A when unbeaten Barnhall travel to Dungannon; in 2B where UL Bohs host Galwegians as the only two unbeaten sides and completing a double header in UL at 5pm, there is an identical match-up in the women’s division between UL Bohs, seeking a third successive title, and surprise leaders Galwegians. Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Ballynahinch, New Ormond Park; Old Belvedere v Lansdowne, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Young Munster, Belfield; Terenure College v St. Mary’s College, Lakelands Park, 3pm (IrishRugby+). Division 1B: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Instonians v Highfield, Shaw’s Bridge; Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Old Wesley v Dublin University, Energia Park; UCC v Queen’s, The Mardyke, 3pm. Division 2A: Ballymena v Cashel, Eaton Park; Banbridge v Old Crescent, Rifle Park; Dungannon v MU Barnhall, Stevenson Park; Galway Corinthians v Wanderers, Corinthian Park; Greystones v Shannon, Dr Hickey Park.

Title: Tadhg Beirne: ‘There’s so much more in us - we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment’

Tadhg Beirne tells a story about Johann van Graan replacing him around the hour mark back in his second season with Munster. Beirne had arrived in Munster in 2016, and Van Graan a year later. They were still getting to know each other and the Monday after replacing him, the coach was about to learn more about Beirne. “I went into his office,” recalls Beirne, “and I was like: ‘Why did you take me off?’ And he was like: ‘I just felt you looked like you needed to come off.’ And I was like: ‘Yeah? I feel like I’m an 80-minute player’.” From that day on, Beirne became one of Van Graan’s 80-minute men. Last season, Beirne completed 80 minutes in all bar one of his 16 starts for Munster, when coming off for the last three minutes away to Ulster. Ditto in his nine starts as an ever-present for Ireland, save for a HIA against Scotland. On the Lions tour he played every minutes of the Tests, after which he was voted player of the series, and played more minutes than any other member of the squad. In all, Beirne played 2,544 minutes last season. In George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which Beirne read as part of his Leaving Cert back in the day, you suggest he would have to be the horse, aka Boxer. He laughs. Did he ever feel tired? “I think I did at times. But by the time the games come around, you’re okay.” You can understand why van Graan felt compelled to replace him. At times on the pitch – maybe it’s the headgear or the gait – he looks shattered. [ Tadhg Beirne happy to crown ‘season full of ups and downs’ with men’s player of the year nodOpens in new window ] “I feel like, often, towards the end of the game is when I can probably express myself a bit more. I suppose you’re probably watching people around you start to diminish a bit. I never feel so tired that I need to come off. I’m just ‘next play’. I don’t know what it is.” He reveals one extreme example. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bad physically as I did after the first Lions Test, and through that whole week. When I got to the Friday, during the captain’s run I was like: ‘Actually this is the worst I’ve felt going into a game’. But then, within the next 24 hours it just got better. The adrenaline kicked in, but that was definitely the worst I’d felt in a long time.” Playing every minute of a Lions’ Test series win made up for being restricted to a combined 16 minutes in two appearances off the bench in a losing series behind closed doors four years earlier. In Australia there was the added bonus of his wife Harriet being there, and were his three sisters, Jennifer, Alannah and Caoimhe (who all lived there at the time) and his parents, Brenda and Gerry. “My older sister’s fiancé was there, younger sister’s boyfriend was there as well, and then I had my aunt and godmother [Fiona] and uncle [Tomás] and their daughter Orla was out as well.” And so too were his cousins Leigh, who lives in Perth, and Cillian. “We are really close, and I’m the only boy, and it’s great for my parents who are retired.” In truth he hasn’t had a day with Ireland or Munster quite like that, but he’s not done yet. The end of a playing career is often related to its beginning. One ventures Johnny Sexton played on until he was 38 in part because he didn’t make his breakthrough with Leinster until he was 23 and with Ireland when he was 24. Similarly, Beirne had played plenty of rugby with the Irish Under-20s and in the AIL, but he was 23 when his career took off with the Scarlets, and 26 when he made his Ireland debut. Last Saturday, Beirne was one of five Ireland players from Kildare in the matchday 23, and in that sense is something of a trailblazer. It’s always been more of a GAA county. “Gaelic and soccer were my two main sports as a kid. Then I tried rugby when I was in fifth class and hated it, so I quit after a month.” All changed when he went to Clongowes. “Rugby was compulsory, so you end up playing, and then you see the senior cup team and all of a sudden you’re in awe.” He had so many sliding doors moments. On leaving school he went into the Leinster system. They’d just created a Bs team which led to two years in the sub-academy with Dave Fagan before three seasons in the full academy. Injuries blighted his three years in the academy, and his lack of bulk. “It was a different game as well. It was very size-orientated and that’s not something I had at the time. I came out of Clongowes at 78kg. If you see pictures of me back then, I’m skin and bone. This morning, I was 120kg!” During his time in the academy, as well as delivering pizza, coaching Blackrock and studying, Beirne played for Lansdowne Under-20s and senior team, with whom he won two AIL medals in 2012-13 and 2014-15, beating Clontarf in both finals, although he was benched for the second one. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster “I was on the bench. I didn’t turn up for training the week before the final and Mike Ruddock dropped me.” Was Ruddock right? “Probably, yeah. I was a bit young and dumb. I think I went to the Trinity Ball the night before.” The following season, Leinster opted to sign Ian Nagle and keep Hayden Triggs, thereby releasing Beirne. “I remember walking off the field in UCD on my own knowing it was my last session. It was emotional, just knowing it was done.” As he was doing his master’s, he told his agent that he had to stay in the Pro12 or England. The Scarlets came in for him, he flew to Wales, met Wayne Pivac and accepted the only rugby offer on the table. “They signed me for very little money,” he says, laughing. After two great years there, winning a Pro12 and Pro12 player of the season, Beirne was within one more season of becoming Welsh qualified when Munster stepped in. Having made his international debut at the age of 26 in Australia, he was part of that series win and also the series win in New Zealand in 2023, and the Grand Slam earlier that year when sidelined with an ankle injury for the last three games. “Obviously it was class to be out there,” he says of the St Patrick’s Day coronation after beating England in the Aviva. “But I’m hobbling around. I’m in a [moon]boot.” There was also the Six Nations title in 2024, a host of landmark wins and individual awards, as well as Munster’s 2022-23 URC title and becoming Munster’s captain. Yet, he sounds more driven than ever. Beirne has unfinished business and though he could yet play until he’s 40, not a huge amount of time to do so. Everything [Clayton McMillan] has been doing is brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities “Ideally, we could have won a lot more. There’s been ups and downs, and that’s well documented in Munster. The quality of the squads we’ve had, we probably should have achieved a bit more. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster. “I thought Johann was incredible when he was in there. At times he got a hard rap for what he did, but in terms of the circumstances and what he was producing, it was very impressive.” Like seemingly all at Munster, Beirne is hugely enthused by the arrival of Clayton McMillan this season. “Last year was a difficult year and I think the freshness that he’s brought in and the way he’s doing things, the way he sees the game, simplifying it in many ways for a lot of players, takes a lot of pressure off them. Everything he’s doing has been brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities. It all adds to a happier, healthier squad.” On Saturday evening Beirne comes up against another significantly influential coach in his career in Joe Schmidt, who gave him his debut in 2018. “I feared Joe. I think most people did. Did he make me a better player? Yeah, 100 per cent, because of the detail part. That’s what everyone speaks about, and it’s the same with Faz [Andy Farrell].” Farrell took the team on to another level with that 17-game winning run and the number one ranking. This team have many of the same personnel without quite scaling those heights since, but Beirne maintains: “We’re in a really good place. I think we’re evolving in the right way, in the way we attack and defend. “I think there’s so much more in us and we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment. I still think we’re one of the best teams in the world for sure. I think we just need to chase it, to go out and prove it.” [ Andy Farrell hits the refresh button hoping to breath new life into IrelandOpens in new window ] And, eh, the lineout malfunctions? “I was calling the lineouts [against Japan], and it was just individual errors all around. The first one was an overthrow. It’s tough, that happens. “And then we proceeded to have two calls when lads misheard the call. It makes the lineout look like a shambles, but they’re the easiest things to fix up. So all of a sudden, I’m trying to be clearer with my voice, so that they don’t mishear me again.” That also happened for the one lineout he called in Soldier Field against the All Blacks before, of course, his third-minute yellow card when Beauden Barrett ran into him was wrongly upgraded into a 20-minute red card, which has been since rescinded. [ Ireland’s unconvincing Japan jobOpens in new window ] “When it happened, I was like: ‘Oh, I felt him on my shoulder there’. I remember saying to the lads in the huddle: ‘I think it’s a penalty. I may end up going off for a yellow card, I don’t know’.” Initially an official told Beirne it would only be a yellow before subsequently confirming that, like all yellow cards, it would go to a bunker review. “It wasn’t until he came up to me probably 30 seconds before I started warming up and he was like: ‘You have a red card.’ I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ It was a bit of a shock.” James Lowe has described the Rugby World Cup in 2027 as his North Star. Is that Beirne’s, or has his eye on a third Lions tour in 2029? “The Lions could be a push but the way I’m feeling I don’t see it [the World Cup] as my North Star now. I see it as the next thing to strive for. I don’t see it as an ending, if you get me. I just see it as the next big competition, especially after the last World Cup, to hopefully right the wrongs of that World Cup.” “It still haunts me,” he admits of that epic 28-24 quarter-final loss to New Zealand, when a 37-phase Irish attack culminated in Wayne Barnes awarding Sam Whitelock a jackal penalty, even though he clearly didn’t release after tackling Rónan Kelleher. “It wasn’t a penalty. Well,” Beirne corrects himself with a smile. “It was a penalty for us.” It would be nice to go back to Australia and create more special memories in front of family and friends in two years’ time? “That’s the goal.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The last time St John’s were in an Antrim county final, Domhnall Nugent went a bit viral. It was 2017 and it was the football final and the first thing to understand about it is that he wasn’t playing for St John’s. Rather, he was in the colours of Belfast rivals Lámh Dearg and neither club had won an Antrim title in the guts of a quarter-century. The second thing to understand is that Nugent was playing against not just some of his best friends and neighbours but also his family. His father Paddy was managing St John’s, his brother Pádraig was in goals. Finally, you must understand that he was 20 years old and he was an alcoholic, with all the chaos and bad decisions that entails. With 10 minutes to go and Lámh Dearg two points up, his brother Pádraig went to take a kick out for St John’s, only for Domhnall to run in and kick the ball away to waste time. It had the desired effect – Pádraig drew out and hit him, earning himself a red card. Domhnall got away with yellow for his messing and Lámh Dearg went on to see out the last 10 minutes against 14 men. He had his 15 minutes of social media infamy in the days that followed. In the eight years since, Domhnall Nugent has been to hell and back. He is six-and-a-half years sober, he has made it back to the Antrim hurling panel and won a Joe McDonagh medal, he is in a solid relationship with his girlfriend Amy and life is good. But it wasn’t until the St John’s hurlers played in the county final last month that he was able to box off that niggling page of the ledger. “I’m not gonna lie,” he says. “Lámh Deargh in 2017 against St John’s was in the middle of my madness. And honestly, there wasn’t one night I went to bed and didn’t think about that from then until the night before the county final a few weeks ago. “Honestly, I had forgiven myself for nearly everything. But not that. And I enjoyed my time with Lámh Dearg and it was good crack and there’s no bad blood or anything. It was just the way it sat for me. “My password on my old Bebo account used to be the 17.03.20 – basically, the 17th of March sometime in the 2020s. It was a way of saying I wanted to someday be in Croke Park on St Patrick’s Day in the club finals. That was always my thing. “So the relief that I got even off getting to a county final with St John’s was unbelievable. And then winning it, that was the first thing that came into my head. I get to celebrate this with everyone that I grew up with.” Nugent is 28 years old now and he is well and in a good place. Davy Fitzgerald is giving him a shot at being one of the goalkeepers on the Antrim panel over the winter, which may or may not work out but he’s up for taking it as far as he can anyway. He is also the current Down camogie manager, exercising a coaching muscle that he has been working on ever since he took a St John’s under-12 team when he was just 15. [ Davy Fitzgerald ‘more guarded’ after criticism over Antrim commentsOpens in new window ] But though he is in the planning stage with all that stuff, the here and now is about the St John’s senior hurlers. In beating Loughgiel a few weeks back, the Belfast club won their first hurling county title in 52 years. They’re more famous as a football club and sit on top of the Antrim roll of honour in the big ball code. But this is only their eighth hurling crown, five of which were won in a 12-year period in the 1960s and 70s. So when it happened, when half a century of nothing finally became something, Nugent threw off his helmet and tried to take it all in. He has a picture in his phone of the first person to reach him to celebrate – his brother Pádraig, fists clenched, mouth roared open. The circle squared. “It was just class,” Domhnall says. “But on the other side of it, a club championship like that is probably number one in most people’s things in life they want to do. But mine has to be my recovery. That’s where Amy came into it. We actually sat down before the final and we booked a flight for the Monday morning to go to Spain for 10 days. “We just got out the gap straight after the county final and that was it. Which was good. It’s good to have that support system where you’re going, ‘Right, you understand me – let’s get out of here.’ I went to St John’s for an hour after the match and then we went home and got a pizza and watched a movie. That was me, content and happy out.” Nugent has spent plenty of time talking in public about his struggles over the years. He did his first big interview with The Irish News back in 2019, a couple of months after coming out of Cuan Mhuire in Newry. He has done the rounds of national media days promoting Movember and the GPA’s mental health initiatives. And it has helped people. He knows it has. [ From the archive: Domhnall Nugent to take time from hurling to help run mental health campaignOpens in new window ] “Recently I got an email from a guy who was at the gig I did in Croke Park two years ago. I went to do the launch of the Ahead of the Game for Movember. This guy messaged me to say that the day after I talked about addiction at it, he went to the GP and it saved his life. So you just never know the impact that you can make on people’s lives. That’s what it was about.” Through it all, he hasn’t sugar-coated anything. He has talked about being homeless, about being addicted to drink and drugs, about lying to the people closest to him. Stories of blowing thousands of pounds, of being left with nothing, of scrabbling around McDonald’s late at night looking to swipe leftover chicken nuggets. He has been brave and open and unflinching. Sometimes to a fault. “I was probably naive for myself. It was the right thing to do for other people, but I’m probably not so sure it was always the right thing to do for me. One, for my recovery and two, for my hurling. “I probably got put on a pedestal and probably pigeonholed myself as someone who was in recovery, someone who was in addiction. And kind of forgot about, ‘Oh, I actually need to work on being fitter or stronger and my touch needs to be better and I need to get better finishing.’ And all these things that I probably didn’t really think about much. “The other part of it, the validation part, that’s probably something that I kind of grabbed on to. People saying to me, ‘Oh, you’re great for speaking out and you’re this and you’re that.’ In some ways, that’s the same thing I was getting from drinking. “It’s two different things but it’s the same feeling. You’re being validated by a substance, whether that’s a human substance or a drink or a drug. So I probably grabbed on to that a wee bit too much. Then all of a sudden, you’re on social media and you’re a wee bit more active on Instagram and waiting on likes and comments because it’s like you’re chasing something. “But listen – do I regret it? No. I definitely would do it again because I know the impact that it’s all had. And there’s been a wee bit of growing up along the way too because I was so young when I got into rehab. I forget that. I forget that I’m six-and-a-half years sober and I’m 28.” Does it get easier? Not really. Or at least, that’s not really how he frames it. Sobriety isn’t a done deal. The lease runs out every night and you start again on a new agreement the next day. It isn’t about easier or harder. It’s just what he has to do. “I want to be very honest with you,” he says. “I think about drink a lot. There wouldn’t be a week in the past six and a half years where I wouldn’t have thought about having a drink. Or going, ‘Jesus, I’d love a pint.’ Or even a wee whiskey. I do think about it regularly. “Sometimes I dream about it and wake up the next morning, tasting Jameson down the back of my throat. You’d wake up sweating and afraid that you’ve relapsed and stuff like that. “So it’s definitely something that is still in me. And I’m just really, really good at the minute. I’m so happy I can say that now because I probably wouldn’t have before. Like, I’m so good and proud that I’m managing it really well through AA and through my friend group, the people who I surround myself with. “I’m so lucky. I’m in a good relationship and I have Amy and things are really, really good. She understands me and I understand her. But it took me a long time to be able to let someone into that journey with me. Even whenever I was sober, I was half-letting people in and getting afraid and pushing them off and doing mad things, stupid things. Just because I wasn’t comfortable. “I always just talk about this journey of no destination. That’s where I’m at. This journey doesn’t have a destination. Obviously it’s great, this kind of fairytale of winning a club championship. That’s brilliant. But that can’t be the journey. External things can’t be the journey. It has to start with you and end with you.” So on he goes and on they go. St John’s have only ever played one Ulster club hurling match – when they won Antrim in 1973, they went out the next day and trounced Ballygalget of Down before getting a walkover in the final against Dungiven. The following March they went all the way down to Cork where Blackrock beat them by 19 points in the All-Ireland semi-final. They start this weekend against Donegal club Setanta and after that, they can only go the only way he knows. One day at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Celebrated illustrated history of the 15th century to be sold at Offaly auction

Antiquarian book dealers and academic libraries across Europe and the United States have already been in contact with Conor Purcell in advance of his auction of books – almost all of which belonged to one collector – on Wednesday, November 26th. As is so often the case, the sellers of The Library of An Irish Gentleman won’t reveal themselves. But, I expect some savvy collectors and local aficionados might know the provenance of these ancient books, such as the first edition of the Nuremberg Chronicle, printed in July 1493 (€20,000-€30,000). Conor Purcell of Purcell auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, says that it will be the first time that a copy of what is deemed to be the most extensively illustrated 15th century book, has ever been offered for sale at auction in Ireland. A pictorial history of the world, the Nuremberg Chronicle (known in German as Schedelsche Weltchronik or Schedel’s World History) was originally written in Latin by medical doctor and book collector, Hartmann Schedel. It includes woodcut illustrations of biblical scenes, early maps of Europe and the world and some of the first created topographical views of towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East. Nuremberg was one of the largest cities in central and western Europe in the 1490s. Around 400 copies of the original Latin version of the book are believed to be still in existence.Purcell says the 1587 edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles (€10,000-€20,000) – another highly collectable book in the auction – is a “cornerstone of English Renaissance historiography”. Compiled by Raphael Holinshed, these historical accounts of England, Scotland and Ireland would have been a primary source of material for writers such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Edmund Spenser. Another highlight is a 1512 edition of a book of hours written in Latin and French (€5,000-€10,000). Books of hours were early Christian prayer books used by those who prayed at specific times of the day (known as canonical hours) in the monastic tradition. This book of hours includes fifteen prayers of St Brigid. During the Covid pandemic, Purcell Auctioneers began selling more and more books as they were easier to sell online and dispatch around the world. This dedication to book selling has paid off, as they have since sold the libraries of many public figures including the late politicians, Conor Cruise O’Brien and Garret FitzGerald, the late journalist, Bruce Arnold and the late owner of Grogan’s pub on Dublin’s South William St, Tommy Smith. “We take all the books from sellers, as intact book collections will absolutely create higher value as they gives a true reflection of the collecting nuances of each collector,” says Purcell. The two volumes of Christian Art in Ancient Ireland (Saorstat Eireann, 1932) compiled by the German archaeologist, Adolf Mahr (€80-€160) is another fascinating book in the Purcell auction. Mahr was a director of the National Museum of Ireland in the 1930s, but was later dismissed when he became leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter. Other books of interest include The Odyssey of Homer and the Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope and printed in 1715 (€1,000-€1,500), several editions of Paradise Lost by John Milton, and The Plays of William Shakespeare in ten volumes (€200-€400). De Búrca Rare Books, based in Blackrock, Co Dublin, also have a vast collections of historic and contemporary books of Irish interest for potential Christmas gifts. Meanwhile, Gormleys auctions is hosting a sale of paintings and prints by Irish and international artists on Tuesday, November 25th at 7.30pm. Gerard Gormley says that the sale reflects the increasing demand for original prints by well established artists. “Collectors recognise the accessibility, rarity and artistic integrity of prints which often provide an entry point in the market,” he says. Highlights at Gormley’s auction – which is on view at 57 Francis St, Dublin from November 19th-25th (10am-5.30pm daily except Sunday, which is 12pm-4pm) include Banksy’s satirical screen print, Morons (€15,000-€20,000). “The piece has become emblematic of Banksy’s critique of consumerism and the commodification of art, while paradoxically commanding significant value in the very market it ridicules,” says Gormley. Patrick Scott’s Tangram 1, one of three pieces using gold leaf (€3,000-€5,000), is also for sale. Finally, Christmas present hunters will no doubt find some potential purchases at the R. J Keighery auction in Waterford city on Monday, November 17th. Among the 750 lots is an electrified three storey over basement Georgian style dolls house, fitted out with period pieces (€600-€1,000). Thomas Keighery says there has also been a lot of interest in a Waterford Crystal chess set in a mahogany case (€3,000-€5,000). Musicians might be keen to have a look at the zither, an antique folk instrument (€50-€80); the French oak-cased small organ (€60-€100); or the upright piano made by the former Liverpool-based instrument suppliers, Rushworth and Dreaper (€60-€100).

Title: Ireland Under-20s battle hard but are beaten by physical South Africa

South Africa were worthy winners, their physical edge in the set piece, scrum and lineout, a significant factor against a gutsy Ireland side that produced several passages of excellent rugby but ultimately were undone by a propensity to make mistakes. Both teams deserve credit for the rugby they produced in horrendous weather at Musgrave Park. The visitors, with the backing of a gale, started with purpose and power and while the home side survived that prolonged assault, a penalty from a ruck offence, offside, gave outhalf Vusi Moyo a long range, wind-assisted opportunity, which he landed with plenty to spare. Ireland lost Arthur Ashmore after 10 minutes, the Terenure man had made one superb carry before his departure with a shoulder injury, but his replacement Cahersiveen’s Michael O’Sullivan in his first action put in a superb tackle. Centres Sean Walsh and Johnny O’Sullivan, secondrow Dylan McNiece, number eight Diarmaid O’Connell and tighthead prop Sam Bishti excelled in the collisions and manufactured positive gain-lines, the only cavil was that scrumhalf Chris Barrett needed to be a little sharper at times to clear the ball. Right wing Charlie Molony, one of the returning players from last season, was a delight to watch, his ability to leave defenders with a handful of nothing roused the hardy home support, while fullback Noah Byrne was another who excelled. Ireland outhalf Tom Wood, in his second season at this level, kicked a 40-metre penalty, a staggering effort into the teeth of the elements to bring the sides level. South Africa though were quickly in the ascendancy once again when hooker Siphosethu Mnebelele barged over for a try, following a well-crafted maul. Moyo kicked a fine conversion to give South Africa a 10-3 lead. Wood, whose astute kicking game had caused problems for the visitors, had the chance to reduce the deficit after McNeice made another super carry but the Irish outhalf was unable to post the 22-metre penalty that ensued. Just before halftime South Africa were very fortunate not to be reduced to 14 players. Irish outhalf Wood was taken out in the air by right wing Khuthadzo Rasivhaga. It looked like a red card offence, no attempt to legitimately contest possession, running underneath the player and causing Wood to land on his back and head. That French referee Julien Caulier and his assistant no more than a couple of feet from the incident decided to award a knock-on beggared belief. After a prolonged period of treatment, the Irish outhalf gingerly walked from the pitch to be replaced by Conor O’Shaughnessy. Ireland got the perfect start to the second half, centre Walsh breaking a tackle en route to the try line. O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 10-10 two minutes after the restart. The home side were guilty of some sloppy play thereafter, basic mistakes and poor decisions and it cost them dearly; two tries, one converted, both from mauls, 12-points and a yellow card for Michael O’Sullivan. Ireland responded positively, a brilliant break from Byrne the precursor to a try for O’Connell. Phiwayinkosi Kubheka barged over for a try, after another Irish error, converted by Moyo as the visitors got a reward for their scrum and general forward dominance. Centre Johnny O’Sullivan hauled his side back into the game on 68-minutes, sharp in blocking down Pieter van der Merwe and collecting the loose ball to dot down for a try, one that O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 22-29. But yet another Irish mistake gave Moyo a chance to tag on another three points with a penalty, a healthy 32-22 lead for the visitors going into the last 10 minutes.

Title: Binance adds BlackRock’s BUIDL as off-exchange collateral for institutional traders

The integration marks another step in centralized exchanges adopting tokenized Treasurys, expanding RWA collateral across major trading platforms. Binance has begun accepting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as off-exchange collateral, giving institutions a way to trade on the exchange while keeping their assets with custodians. The integration combines BlackRock’s onchain money market fund with Binance’s custody systems, enabling traders to earn yield on BUIDL while using it to support trading positions on the exchange. A new BUIDL asset class will also launch on BNB Chain, expanding the token’s reach beyond Ethereum and opening it to a wider set of onchain applications, according to a blog post by Binance on Friday. With the addition of BUIDL, Binance supports multiple yield-bearing tokenized assets, including Circle’s USYC and OpenEden’s cUSDO. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first onchain liquidity fund — a tokenized, interest-bearing USD vehicle issued through Securitize. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversaw roughly $13.4 trillion in assets as of Q3 2025. Related: Securitize to go public in $1.25B BlackRock-backed merger As tokenized money-market funds shift from simple yield products to mainstream trading collateral, Binance joins a growing group of exchanges allowing qualified clients to post Treasury-backed tokens to back their positions. In July, Deribit and Crypto.com began accepting BUIDL as collateral, giving institutional traders a low-volatility, yield-bearing asset they can use in place of cash or stablecoins. In September, Bybit followed with support for QCDT, a Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)-approved tokenized money-market fund backed by US Treasurys. The trend echoes traditional finance, where companies often pledge Treasurys and money-market funds as collateral through bank-run triparty systems rather than keeping assets on a trading venue. Tokenized US Treasurys have become the second-largest real-world assets (RWA) beyond stablecoins, with a current market cap of $8.57 billion, according to RWA.xyz data. The funds are led by BlackRock’s BUIDL, with about $2.52 billion in total value, Circle’s USYC with $1.06 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $850 million.

Title: A 51-year-old man, the oldest ever recruit, and former RTÉ journalist among new garda graduates

THE OLDEST EVER recruit to graduate from the Garda College has encouraged other people his age to “go for it”. Jeremiah Bourke, 51, said he wanted to join the gardaí when he was younger but missed the opportunity. He said he recognises it is going to be a “tough job”, but said: “You’re never too old. “If you’re able, why not? Give it a go. I’d say to anybody out there, if you want to go for it – go for it.” He added: “I’ve done it, anyone can do it.” Bourke said he had always had hope that he could become a garda, so re-applied when the recruiting age limit increased from 35 to 50 at the start of last year. He was within that age range when he applied. “I was in the retail business and wanted to give that a chance, but unfortunately as time goes fast the closing date for the competition passed me by.” He added: “I didn’t miss the bus time – and here I am attesting today at a later stage.” He said it was “not easy” and “a bit daunting” to go through the training alongside younger recruit, but said he was supported by his wife and two children as well as all those at the College. He was one of 194 gardaí attesting from the Templemore Garda College in Co Tipperary on Friday. Among them, Garda Amy Ní Riada was eager to get “stuck in” after trading in a career in the media to join An Garda Síochána. The former RTÉ journalist, from Castleisland in Co Kerry, said she developed a taste for working in high-pressure environments and a role with variety. Garda Amy Ní Riada, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo She was inspired to join the gardaí seeing the response to the November 2023 riots in Dublin. “It was an eye opener for me that I wanted to be stuck in and got involved in that way.” Advertisement Ní Riada, who will be stationed in Midleton, Co Cork, also said being in An Garda Síochána was perfect” for her desire to work with the most vulnerable people in society, having previously reported on climate change, social issues and violence against women in east Africa. They were among 194 new gardaí and 17 garda reserves attesting from the Garda College in Templemore on Friday. It is the largest single attestation of new gardaí since 2019 and the college will also see its largest class of recruits in a decade enter next week. Garda Kristina Courtney also left a career in communications and media production to join the gardaí. She said she was inspired to join after getting an insight into the operations of An Garda Síochána by working on RTÉ’s Crimecall programme. Garda Amy Ní Riada (left) and Kristina Courtney, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Part of her role involved making actors “look like the bad guys”. Asked how she felt about dealing with real bad guys, she replied: “I’m up for the challenge.” Dubliner Adam O’Rourke said he joined An Garda Síochána because he wanted a career where he could help people and challenge himself. Garda O’Rourke, from Walkinston, previously served with the Defence Forces in Lebanon. Now being stationed in Blackrock, Dublin, he said he was happy to start making a difference in the community: “It is a fantastic day, I couldn’t be happier.” Speaking at the Garda College, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said it was a “great honour” to “witness the continued growth of An Garda Síochána and to welcome its newest members”. Of the 194 attesting on Friday, 137 are men and 57 are women and the new probationers will be assigned to divisions across the country by the Garda Commissioner.

Title: The conference, K.M. and the ambassador, Tsipras, the “free dove” and its…consequences, the green eagle from Chios & why the Athens Stock Exchange now feels like August

Full Content:
Hello, today we aspire to be the topic of the day, since the conference organized by “Proto Thema” and travel.gr at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel will host the Prime Minister, the U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle, Hatzidakis, Papastavrou, Hardalias, the president of SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos, as well as dozens of distinguished Greek and foreign entrepreneurs, scientists, and public figures. Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel, Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos. Today there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga, as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday, especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well, I was told that the relationship soured later, when Tsipras was in the opposition, and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break, especially in politics, and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves, not to the… audience, particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras, with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy, should have expected such clashes, bitterness, and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out, there will be much more, possibly much worse. In that sense, I don’t know whether he did the right thing, because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots,” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore, some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him, hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand, the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad, it’s still publicity, and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most. Meanwhile, Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios, named Stavros Michailidis, appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones, and with a 19-seat capacity, at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft, he replied: “I know, I know, because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP, whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related), read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand, Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement, yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that? I hear that today at noon, after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time,” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp, things have always been worked out around a table, but K. M. avoids dinners. The in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm, and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle, who gives especially elegant gifts, brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging, while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica, but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas, about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador. After meeting the Archbishop, the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense, where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast, toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems. The government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency, Maximos Mansion, and Parliament, where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total, from the Press Office, Protocol, and the Ukrainian Embassy, who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time, which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens, then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours, compared with the initial schedule. Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT, the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words, our money—because, shockingly, the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone, including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years, following the bill on the registry of print and online media, order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting, and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things… A longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who, through Nikos Karachalios, “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had, among other things, an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more? On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This, of course, remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon, as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side, where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares, brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients, and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors, it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast, where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders, but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success. If the column had to place a bet, it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g., a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously, a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know), and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI, FTSE, etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed, with the relevant decision coming in two or three months, as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market, and beyond that, our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.” OTE’s CEO, Kostas Nebis, described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber, which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project, with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project, with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT), of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure, and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023, OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones, and with the completion of the above agreements, OTE will assume the entire project, with the concession period (service period), before the infrastructure is transferred to the State, amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts, Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas, as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country, in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market. As for OTE’s results, what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously, something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications, but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market, but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax,” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally, pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case, OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange, with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end. And since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company, let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically, everything started in early autumn, when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules, photography was forbidden, the meetings were confidential, and the event was not widely publicized. At that time, representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia, made the necessary presentations, and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent, and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion, but even more important is the increase in trading volume, while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern. Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight, this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital, his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles, it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region, Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side, particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI, we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation,” he said, implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes, his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives, at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects. The cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close, marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones, facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels, which, however, do not fully cover the needs of islanders, particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time, freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels, which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route, which had been discussed at times, seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link, there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example, when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season. The trading week began with the General Index at 1,986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week, closing at 2,074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer, when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2,000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets, which were drifting in negative territory, with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight, the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2,074.96 points, while today it traded between 2,057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2,083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million, with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session, followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23), Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2), Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2), TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35), and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC, Alpha Bank, Optima Bank, and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks, ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit, as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35). The Greek company Theon, listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100,000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move, Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400,000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026, Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi. With five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register, TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday, the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos, who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing, as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million, zero debt, and first-half profits of €560,000, TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange, with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs. The Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025, after the €1.65-billion agreement in September, while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome, a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI, which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions, Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider. Seventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today, subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October, the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, the largest subprime auto lender, acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns, then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway. Explore related questions

Title: Tucker to Release Information on Butler Assassination – Here’s Our List of What is Missing

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/14/2025 9:20:13 AM PST by Red Badger Tucker Carlson to announce his findings related to the assassination attempt of President Trump in Butler on Friday night. Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Title: How the Grayscale IPO changes the cost to hold $35 billion crypto ETF shares

Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 13 to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol GRAY. The firm manages approximately $35 billion across more than 40 crypto products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a public company, Grayscale will have to disclose more financials and face shareholder pressure, which could influence future fee decisions and product strategy. The filing does not specify share count or pricing range for the proposed offering. Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor will serve as lead managing bookrunners. Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. The company posted net income of $203.3 million through September 2025 compared with $223.7 million a year earlier. Operating margin reached 65.7% in the recent nine-month period. The firm’s weighted-average management fee declined to 1.39% through September 2025 from 1.67% in the prior-year period, reflecting competitive pressure from lower-cost ETF entrants, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Average assets under management slipped to $30.6 billion from $31.8 billion year-over-year. Full-year 2024 results showed revenue of $506.2 million and net income of $282.1 million, down from $512.7 million and $325 million, respectively, in 2023. The company attributed the decline to reduced management fees, outflows, and distributions. The offering employs a dual-class share structure, giving Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, 10 votes per Class B share compared with one vote per Class A share. DCG will retain approximately 70% of total voting power after the IPO through its Class B holdings, which carry no economic rights. Each Class A share will receive one vote and full economic participation. The structure qualifies Grayscale as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements. The Class B super-voting rights terminate when DCG’s ownership falls below 20% of total shares outstanding. The IPO does not alter the legal structure, custody arrangements, or operations of Grayscale’s existing trusts and ETFs. Fund assets remain held by third-party custodians under separate trust agreements. The company completed a reorganization into a Delaware holding structure earlier in 2025, which it stated would not materially affect trust operations. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase membership interests from existing owners in Grayscale Operating, rather than funding capital expenditures. The transaction converts private ownership stakes into publicly tradable equity without requiring the injection of new capital into fund operations or altering sponsor fee arrangements. Grayscale reserved a portion of IPO shares for eligible investors in its Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) through a directed share program. Participants must have held GBTC or ETHE shares as of Oct. 28 and complete pre-registration by Nov. 24. The program does not guarantee allocations, and shares purchased through it face no lock-up restrictions. The public listing will subject Grayscale to quarterly and annual reporting requirements, providing ETF investors with increased visibility into the sponsor’s financial condition, litigation exposure, and product concentration. The registration statement indicates that future fee decisions and product expansion plans will face scrutiny from public equity holders alongside existing competitive pressure in the ETF market.
