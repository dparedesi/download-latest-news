Title: Rachel Fehily: Why are the experiences of people born, like me, in Temple Hill forgotten?

I spent the first three months of my life in a contested space: Temple Hill in Blackrock, Dublin, commonly known as St Patrick’s Infant and Dietetic Hospital. It is contested because there is a fundamental disagreement as to its historical purpose: there are two different retrospective interpretations of its function. To this day the Government insists that it was a hospital; but in reality, it was an adoption home for infants and babies. It was stated in a parliamentary question in the Dáil by Sinn Féin TD Claire Kerrane last year that: “Temple Hill does not qualify for supports, redress or recognition because it was a hospital, yet babies were adopted and paid for on foot of newspaper advertisements. Many children went to America. I have never heard of a hospital that does that.” Despite the indisputable fact that many children were adopted from Temple Hill through the former adoption society St Patrick’s Guild, and some were resident for lengthy periods of time, it is one of at least four institutions excluded from the Mother and Baby Institutions payment scheme as it was not on the initial list of homes investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. The fact that it was not an institution within the meaning of the terms of the commission and no mothers resided there with their babies (apparently they were taken from them at the door) kept it out of its terms of reference. I am not seeking a payment under the scheme or looking for redress personally, because I left Temple Hill with my adoptive parents at the age of three months. I was fortunate to grow up with six siblings – five adopted, also from the same location – in a stimulating and supportive environment, but I am advocating for people who have been left out. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has stated that the official commission report was flawed because many institutions were excluded. Its remit was too narrow. In an “alternative report”, a team including survivors, activists and eminent academics wrote that its “text excluded significant cohorts of affected people” and that “it is regrettable that the Commission did not request to modify its terms of reference to permit deep engagement with a wider range of organisations”. Minister for Children, Disability and Equality Norma Foley will have a chance to review the operation of the scheme within six months of its second anniversary, by September 2026. Many of the now-ageing adults who were resident and abused in institutions and identify themselves as “survivors” in need of the supports offered by the scheme are currently left in limbo. I had the pleasure of meeting the Irish artist Bernard Canavan, a recipient of the prestigious Presidential Award for his contribution to Irish culture in the UK at the Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, London. He recently held an exhibition at The United Arts Club in Dublin entitled Theocracy. His paintings represent the trauma that he and others endured in institutions. He was a long-term resident of the same Temple Hill in Blackrock, more than 25 years before me. Despite evidence of his abuse, neglect, lengthy period of residency at Temple Hill, and his advanced age, he is excluded from the payment scheme because of “contested” definitions. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has set up a comprehensive curriculum resource on “mother and baby homes” for the Junior Cycle. It developed it in collaboration with groups involved in advocating for survivors of “historic” institutions. This is an important and worthwhile initiative. The list of related literature for the English curriculum is comprehensive and impressive, including the novel Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan and the play An Trial by Máiréad Ní Ghráda. The curriculum has input from many survivors and is all the better for it. However, the framing of the curriculum comes directly from the NCCA, a statutory body of the Department of Education. At the launch, Minister for Education Helen McEntee said: “It is vital that our young people learn about the history of this State in every aspect, and in order to provide this teaching and learning, teachers must be supported with resources such as this one.” One of the resources for Junior Cycle teachers - a series of slides, maps, a list of the homes included in the Commission’s report - omits the contested homes. Much of the lengthy reading list that goes with the teacher supports comprises “official” reports. Searching through the voluminous reading list, I eventually found an alternative “List of Institutions, Agencies and Personnel Involved in Separating Unmarried Mothers from their Children.” It is collated by Claire McGettrick and the Justice for Magdalenes Research and Adoption Rights Alliance. The database includes St Patrick’s Infant Dietetic Hospital (aka Temple Hill). It is vital that students understand how our Government and legal system operates to include and exclude people from access to justice. These nuances matter. If school children are taught to think critically they might be driven to question as to whether their history curriculum is in fact “history” or “current affairs”? In Fintan O’Toole’s excellent recent article on the excavation of the Tuam site, he writes that: “This is making history in a double sense – doing something that has never been done before while simultaneously reshaping a country’s understanding of its own recent past. And, hopefully, of its present.” It seems ironic that the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four has been removed from the Senior Cycle curriculum for 2026 by the Department of Education, while Greta Gerwig’s film Barbie has been deemed worthy of inclusion. Leaving Certificate students won’t have to read George Orwell’s text or consider one of its most memorable lines: “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.” But they will have a chance to consider this dialogue by Weird Barbie: “That Ken of yours, he is one nice looking little protein pot … I’d like to see what kind of nude blob he’s packing under those jeans.” Rachel Fehily is a barrister, lecturer in literature and justice at UCD and is engaged in interdisciplinary creative-based doctoral studies supported by Research Ireland © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The best restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to

The Barrett family of Dunmore House Hotel know more than a thing or two about hospitality. Over the years, they have consistently developed and improved their little piece of heaven overlooking Clonakilty Bay. Under head chef Manuel Canapini, Adrift has become a contender for the country’s top seafood spots – trawler to table. Joanne Cronin It was all change last year at Aniar when owner JP McMahon commissioned architect Aidan Conway to create a new interior for this iconic Galway restaurant. Out went the lighter greens and neutral tones, making way for a darkened interior with dramatic focused lighting. It makes sense though, acting as a focus for McMahon’s dishes which have evolved into an intense, almost primal, expression of the west of Ireland. JC Baba’de may be the little sibling to Michelin-starred Dede, but this charming little spot is standing firmly on its own two feet. Under chef Muslim Karafil, savour fragrant delights such as charcoal grilled chicken thighs with hazelnut satay sauce, spiced crispy chicken with brown butter dip, or a whole west Cork blue lobster with pil pil potato mousseline. Or come for Turkish-influenced brunch on weekends. JC At Ballyfin – a hotel so exclusive it barely seems real – Richard Picard-Edwards has delivered the final flourish: a Michelin star for the diningroom. The €145 eight-course tasting menu is on the familiar side of grandeur, with a thrillingly good Jerusalem artichoke cream topped with chicken jelly and gold leaf, and dishes featuring lobster and caviar. Broths, purées and reductions bring depth without being overwrought. Non-residents can book, but getting a table feels about as casual as applying for citizenship. Read our full review here. Corinna Hardgrave Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix turns out sharp, confident cooking built on serious pedigree – Sam cooked at Ballyfin and Bath Priory – and produce from their own walled garden. The lunch menu and midweek Supper at Six are great value, but it’s at dinner that the kitchen really hits its stride, with a la carte and tasting menus (€80) delivering dishes like seared scallops, honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion, pan-fried wild halibut with mussels, and slow-roast organic duck. Read our full review here. CH The dark wood panelling of Ashford Castle’s George V diningroom might scream old-school but under executive head chef Liam Finnegan the food has taken a fresher turn. French-rooted, yes, but lighter, with sauces built on serious stocks rather than just butter and cream. Much of the produce now comes from a new two-acre kitchen garden, run by head gardener Alex Lavarde using no-dig methods and supplying everything from beets to honey. The twice-baked Hegarty’s cheese soufflé is a must; the wine cellar, as always, is formidable. CH It’s not every day a stone-walled cottage on the wild west coast lands a Michelin star, but Robbie McCauley’s precise cooking makes it feel inevitable. Along with his wife Sophie, he has transformed this former cafe into something rooted in tradition but unmistakably modern, serving a nine-course dinner (€125) and six-course lunch (€85). McCauley works tightly with local producers, using Burren outwintered beef, and lobster and crab from Michael O’Connell, they raise their own chickens and have an impressive vegetable garden. There’s even a small terrace for pre-dinner drinks – if the weather behaves. Read our full review here. CH When Bryan Meehan – the Irish entrepreneur behind Blue Bottle Coffee – bought The Park Hotel from the Brennan brothers last year, two things changed in the diningroom. The tasting menu was dropped in favour of a focused a la carte, and Meehan hung two Sean Scully paintings – one of which gives the room its name, The Landline. Local chef James O’Sullivan keeps things classic but special with seared scallops, Kerry Hill lamb, and pan-seared sole. Non-residents can book. CH One of Dublin’s smallest restaurants and one of its mightiest, Liath is an intimate space where food is staged as art. Damien Grey and team perform manoeuvres with grace through service in the fully open kitchen, allowing guests to see the artists at work. Grey is looking to move to a larger space, so make sure to get a booking at Blackrock market before they leave. JC Chef Stevie McCarry recently won the Northern Ireland final of the Great British Menu, a well-earned accolade for this self-taught chef. With wife Rebekah, he has developed Lir into a truly exciting seafood restaurant. The Japanese konro grill is put to good use in the kitchen which turns out cod collar schnitzel, ling kofta with burnt apple sauce and smoked dogfish corndog. Look out for the upcoming summer music nights on the terrace. Read our full review here. JC After more than 30 years in business, Denis Cotter is planning his transition away from his legendary fine-dining vegetarian restaurant. Long-term restaurant manager Dave O’Mahony is in line to take over, with head chef Miguel Frutos continuing to lead the kitchen into the future. With produce grown in a unique partnership with Gort na Náin farm and a super natural wine menu, Paradiso continues to set the standard. Read our full review here. JC There isn’t another restaurant quite like Rare. Drawing on his classical French training, chef Meeran Manzoor has invented a cuisine that is all his own, using the best of local produce accented with flavours from his home city of Chennai. His menu descriptions may sound simple but they belie a complexity of spice and nuanced technique that is simply delightful. JC Rob Krawczyk and Elaine Fleming’s Michelin-starred Chestnut offers three routes – a €55 two-course prix fixe, a four-course for €75 or the full €120 tasting menu. Ingredients are local and fiercely seasonal – Lisheen Greens, Twomey’s butchers, Union Hall fish – with much of it cooked over a custom wood-fired grill. Expect wild halibut with mussels or aged Skeaghanore duck with coal onion and sour cherries. His food is exacting, mature and restrained – one of the country’s top chefs. CH Sitting in a little glen outside Ballyvaughan, Gregans Castle is the quirky but extremely stylish countryside hotel of dreams. Chef Jonathan Farrell moved from Dublin to take over the kitchens and is producing food perfectly harmonised with the stunning landscapes. Choose from dishes such as wild garlic spaetzle, Atlantic scallop with XO, butter-poached cod, roast rack of Burren lamb or forced rhubarb direct from the hotel garden. Read our full review here. JC The Olde Glen bar would have a serious chance in any “Ireland’s most traditional pub” competition, and is worth a visit in its own right. But it’s the cooking of Ciaran Sweeney to the rear of the pub that brings the punters in night after night. The menu is packed with local produce including roast Mulroy Bay scallops, fermented potato bread with Gortahork cabbage and glazed Killybegs cod. JC Former Michelin star chef Danni Barry keeps things razor sharp at the Owenmore Restaurant, with a four-course table d’hote menu (€95) that lets the ingredients do the talking. Kilkeel scallops with caramelised kohlrabi, line-caught mackerel with blood orange and horseradish, barbecued quail with soy and honey, and wild sea bass with salt-baked celeriac are cooked with precision. Bookings are available for non-residents. CH © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Naysayer Vanguard Makes Bold Bet On Strategy Stock–Details

In a twist that few saw coming, Vanguard has quietly become the top shareholder in Strategy (MSTR). The $10 trillion asset manager now owns just over 20 million MSTR shares. That adds up to nearly 8% of Strategy’s Class A stock. Vanguard once warned that Bitcoin was “immature” and carried “no inherent economic value.” Now it finds itself deeply tied to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin play. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard didn’t set out to back Saylor’s moves. It simply follows its index‑fund rules. When Strategy’s stock climbed, it grew larger in the indexes that the company tracks. The result: Vanguard had to buy more shares. Through its broad‑market funds, the asset manager ended up with a stake worth hundreds of millions of dollars. It shows how passive strategies can lead to active positions in unexpected places. Vanguard’s CEO Tim Buckley once said that Bitcoin “could wreak havoc on portfolios.” He argued that the flagship crypto lacked the history and solid ground that long‑term investors need. Yet Vanguard’s own track record of following index weights means it can’t shy away from a stock that’s on the rise. No matter the fund’s view on Bitcoin, the rules forced its hand. Strategy now holds 601,550 BTC. Each share of MSTR represents a slice of that giant pile of Bitcoin. For anyone holding Vanguard’s indexes, that means indirect exposure to more than half a million coins. Since 2020, MSTR stock has climbed around 3,400%. That surge helped push the firm’s market value up fast enough to land in Vanguard’s top holdings. Large investors often use ETFs or purpose‑built products to get Bitcoin exposure. Vanguard could have joined the likes of BlackRock in launching a spot Bitcoin ETF. But it declined. Instead, it finds itself holding a big chunk of Strategy. That makes it an unwitting part of the Bitcoin story, even if it wasn’t the path the firm’s managers originally chose. The fact that Vanguard is now the largest shareholder of $MSTR is proof that God has a sense of humor, or at least that was my reaction to @VildanaHajric who wrote story about it out today pic.twitter.com/TLg4iqT3kQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 14, 2025 Michael Saylor sees this as a sign that institutions are coming around to Bitcoin. He told Bloomberg that Vanguard’s stake is “a powerful signal” of acceptance. For years, many big firms treated Bitcoin as a niche asset. Now they’re tied to its fortunes through Strategy’s public shares. That shift may encourage others to take a closer look. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed up the irony on X, saying “God has a sense of humor.” He pointed out that Vanguard’s index approach means it must own all the stocks in its benchmarks—whether it likes them or not.

Wednesday, 16 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors digested fresh inflation data and a wave of earnings reports from major financial institutions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points, or 0.98 percent, to close at 44,023.29. The S&P 500 fell 24.8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,243.76. In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite rose 37.47 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,677.8, marking a new all-time closing high. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closed in the red. Materials and health care were the biggest decliners, falling 2.11 percent and 1.88 percent, respectively. Technology was the only sector to finish higher, gaining 1.27 percent. June's inflation data, released Tuesday, showed consumer prices rising 0.3 percent for the month, in line with expectations and up from May's pace. The annual CPI rate stood at 2.7 percent. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, climbed 0.2 percent from the previous month and 2.9 percent year over year, both matching analysts' forecasts. Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, said it was a relief to see Tuesday's CPI report come in line with expectations, but "it's highly likely that a tariff-driven inflation reckoning is coming." "The latest U.S. inflation report practically confirmed that President Trump's tariffs acted to push up consumer prices in June," said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebuy. On the earnings front, several major banks delivered underwhelming results. Wells Fargo beat profit expectations but issued lower guidance for net interest income, pushing its shares down more than 5 percent. JPMorgan Chase also posted strong results but saw its shares slip. BlackRock dropped 5.88 percent after missing revenue estimates. Citigroup stood out, gaining 3.68 percent after beating second-quarter earnings expectations. In the tech sector, Nvidia surged 4.04 percent after announcing it would resume shipments of its H20 AI chips to China, following White House assurances that current export restrictions would be eased. The news sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 6.41 percent, Arm Holdings and Broadcom each added less than 2 percent, and the iShares Semiconductor ETF climbed 1 percent. Among other mega-cap tech names, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon posted modest advances. Tesla declined 1.93 percent, and Meta Platforms lost 1.46 percent. Thank you for your report!

Title: S&P 500 Gains & Losses Today: State Street, BlackRock Shares Fall; Nvidia Stock Rises

Major U.S. equity indexes were mixed as the latest Consumer Price Index report showed inflation ticking higher in June, with indications that President Donald Trump's tariffs are beginning to push up prices on goods like groceries and clothing. The CPI report was in line with economists' forecasts. Still, the lift in inflation likely came as a disappointment to investors hoping that a softer reading might nudge the Federal Reserve towards cutting interest rates as soon as this summer. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session with a loss of 0.4%. The Dow dropped more than 400 points, falling 1%, while strength in the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq to another record closing high with a gain of 0.2%. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. Shares of financial services giant State Street (STT) slipped 7.3%, suffering the steepest drop in the S&P 500, in the wake of the firm's second-quarter earnings release. Although sales and profits topped estimates, net interest income was down from the year-ago period. State Street's total expenses jumped 11% year-over-year, reflecting a $100 million workforce rationalization and higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as technology and infrastructure investments. Agilent Technologies (A) shares fell about 6%. The laboratory instrument provider said that CFO Bob McMahon would leave the company for personal reasons, effective at the end of July. Rodney Gonsalves, Agilent's corporate controller and principal accounting officer, will serve as interim CFO. Analysts at Citi recognized investors' esteem for McMahon but suggested that his departure should not have a major impact on the company's outlook. BlackRock (BLK) reported that its assets under management reached a record level of $12.5 trillion in the second quarter, but the firm's revenue for the period fell short of expectations. The top-line miss resulted partly from a decline in net inflows, which BlackRock attributed to a major single institutional client making a major withdrawal from index funds. BlackRock shares lost 5.9% on Tuesday, receding from a record high posted in the prior session. Semiconductor giant and world's highest-valued company Nvidia (NVDA) said it intends to relaunch sales of its top-selling H20 AI chip in China. The announcement came days after a meeting between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Trump. Nvidia shares jumped 4% to a record high on Tuesday. Nvidia's plans to resume H20 chip deliveries to China helped boost other stocks in the artificial intelligence space. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) surged 6.9%, notching the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Citi analysts recently lifted their price target on Supermicro stock, highlighting strong demand for AI servers and an increasing supply of key Nvidia-produced server components. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares were up 6.4%, adding to gains posted last week after analysts at HSBC suggested that AMD's AI chips are comparable to Nvidia's offerings. First Solar (FSLR) shares jumped 6.9% after Jefferies increased its price target on the panel maker's stock. Although analysts recognized that the macroeconomic challenges facing the renewable energy business could weigh on First Solar's second-quarter financial results, Jefferies believes additional visibility surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act could help drive volume gains starting in 2026.

The NYC Partnership threw a party — but no one really showed up. A who’s who of the New York City business community were no shows for a Tuesday meet and greet session with socialist democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The list of New York City-based CEOs that declined the Partnership’s invitation includes Jamie Dimon, the nation’s top banker and chief of JP Morgan, the nations largest bank; Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity powerhouse Blackstone; Brian Moynihan, the head of Bank of America, the nations second largest bank; Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the worlds largest asset manager; and David Solomon, the CEO of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. Most publicly pleaded “scheduling conflicts.” But “what is this guy going to tell us that we don’t already know?” is how someone close to Solomon described the situation. Those sentiments were pretty universal among according to sources at the banks of the CEOs who didn’t attend. There was once a time that CEOs of this caliber would want to meet the likely next mayor of the city. Now, it’s resignation — a bet that New York City is a lost cause, and a belief that the Partnership, run by the retiring Kathy Wylde, is an increasingly impotent advocate to turn back the increasingly leftist political class. Most business leaders I know are looking for an exit strategy rather than a strategy to deal with a mayor Mamdani. Yes, they want the current mayor Eric Adams to stick around — ethical warts and all — because he’s the devil they know and they like his very competent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.

But Adams faces an uphill climb, all the more so because Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the primary, is leading what they see as a Quixotic run as an independent. Curtis Sliwa, the GOP nominee, is going nowhere fast. The polls, for now, show a likely Mamdani mayoralty, combined with a leftist city council and a state government that veers nearly as far left as Zohran. All which spells disaster for those businesses who stay: Police defunding, higher taxes and government takeover of businesses like supermarkets. And that gets us to why there were so many no shows Tuesday: the city’s business community doesn’t have to stay. If you follow these big firms, as I do, you know they employ hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers — but fewer and fewer in recent years. The harsh COVID lockdowns here gave them the excuse to move operations to places with lower taxes and regulations, mainly Florida and Texas, but also Utah and even Tennessee. Mamdani will be another reason for the big banks to finally say goodbye to Gotham.

Title: Disabled children suffered higher rates of sexual abuse, Dáil hears during debate on historical abuse

Children with disabilities experienced sexual abuse at a much higher rate than children without a disability, the Dáil heard as it debated historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. Minister of State for Special Education and Inclusion Michael Moynihan said the scoping inquiry leading to the newly established Commission of Investigation revealed the records of religious orders showed “some 528 allegations of historical child sexual abuse across 17 special schools in respect of 190 alleged abusers”. The initial scoping inquiry was told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. It was told it involved 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools countrywide between 1927 to 2013. The Minister of State said “many families entrusted the care of their children into these communities” and “this is unlikely to be the full extent of the historical abuse in special schools”. It was “truly appalling that the additional vulnerabilities of children in special schools could be so exploited and there has to be accountability”, Mr Moynihan said. He was speaking during a debate on the motion to approve the draft order on the Commission of Investigation on the handling of historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. [ Government will ‘pursue all levers’ to make religious orders pay redress to victims of school sex abuseOpens in new window ] Sinn Féin TD Pat Buckley said he had lost many friends who had been abused and it took more than 20 years to find out what happened. “I lost two friends in primary school where the abuse started and I wasn’t aware of it.” He said “people ran away from school, came back, qualified as solicitors and everything, and unfortunately ended their lives”. He said some of the people who are responsible “are still alive, some of the principals and vice-principals, Christian Brothers and lay teachers”. Labour’s Ciarán Ahern said the Government and other institutions of power “have excelled in the past at covering up the reality of child sexual abuse”. “We need only look at the Carrigan report in 1931 to see the DNA of denial that blighted child protection in Ireland from the State’s foundation”. The Dublin South-West TD said the Carrigan committee was appointed in 1930 and held 17 sessions. One witness, the police commissioner of the time, “highlighted an alarming amount of sexual crime, increasing yearly, a feature of which was the large number of cases of criminal interference with girls and children from 16 years and downwards, many children under 10 years of age”. He said the police commissioner believed that less than 15 per cent of sexual crime was being prosecuted but government chose not to publish the report. Minister for Education Helen McEntee thanked “every single survivor for their bravery, whether they were in a position to come forward or not”. She also thanked the late Mark Ryan and his brother David who came forward for the RTÉ documentary Blackrock Boys, after which the Government established a scoping inquiry. In an address to survivors she said: “I am truly sorry for what was done to you and the devastating impacts it had on your lives, but I want to thank each and every person for their bravery.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

World The logo for J.P.Morgan appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, May 1, 2025. (Photo: AP/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK: The Nasdaq Composite posted a fresh record close on Tuesday (Jul 15), lifted by a surge in shares of Nvidia, even as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones slipped amid lukewarm inflation data and mixed bank earnings. It was the tech-heavy index's fourth record close in five sessions, and its eighth since Jun 27. Artificial-intelligence chip leader Nvidia gained 4 per cent after it unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China. The news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both gaining more than 6.4 per cent. The semiconductor index also advanced 1.3 per cent to its highest point in a year, while the S&P technology index climbed by the same percentage to hit a record high. "The Nvidia news meant that some investors, who had moved into other stocks due to high tech valuations, were rotating back," said Rob Swanke, senior investment research analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network. "I would probably say it's a one-day pop," he added, noting that investors would look to see the sales reflected in upcoming earnings. The Nasdaq Composite added 37.47 points or 0.18 per cent to end at 20,677.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 436.36 points or 0.98 per cent to 44,023.29, and the S&P 500 lost 24.80 points or 0.40 per cent to 6,243.76. Markets have been buoyant in recent weeks as concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies eased. However, this week is seen as a key test, with second-quarter earnings and inflation data in focus. US consumer prices posted their largest gain in five months in June, suggesting tariffs may be contributing to rising costs. Still, underlying inflation remained moderate, offering investors some relief. "The picture from inflation this morning, coming in a little bit higher than expected but pretty much in line, gives you some sense that the tariffs are starting to flow through into the economy," said Commonwealth's Swanke. "We'll get more concrete news, as we go through earnings, to see how companies are delivering the impact of higher tariffs." The second-quarter earnings season opened on a muted note. JPMorgan Chase slipped 0.7 per cent despite raising its 2025 net interest income outlook, while Wells Fargo fell 5.5 per cent even as its profit improved due to reduced loan-loss reserves. BlackRock reported a new milestone in assets under management, but its shares slid 5.9 per cent. Citigroup bucked the trend, climbing 3.7 per cent to its highest finish since the global financial crisis, after its trading division delivered a strong performance that lifted second-quarter profits. The number of shares changing hands on US exchanges on Tuesday was 16.82 billion, compared with the 17.55 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

Title: Is Ethereum’s $3K rejection a spark for ETH’s next breakout?

Time Published: 2025-07-15T20:00:13Z

Ethereum’s dip might be less a setback and more a springboard. Ethereum just saw a 2% dip and heavy liquidations, yet Open Interest and ETF inflows suggest strong underlying conviction. BlackRock alone added 50,970 ETH as capital quietly rotates from Bitcoin. Ethereum [ETH] just took a 2% hit and got rejected hard at a key resistance level, and suddenly $3,000 is looking more like a local top than a launchpad. In fact, that drop wiped out $82.28 million in longs, nearly 80% of the day’s liquidations. And there’s still $47 million hanging by a thread, ready to go with even a minor dip. Typically, you’d expect a deeper flush in Open Interest (OI) after that kind of leverage reset. But interestingly, OI has barely budged, down just 0.55% from its record $43.94 billion the day before. Source: CryptoQuant Zoom out a bit, and the setup feels familiar. Back then, Ethereum’s OI held steady through a tight consolidation zone between $2,640 and $2,450. The result? A breakout rally that pushed ETH up 20% in under two weeks, alongside a fresh OI peak. Now, throw in another $260 million into spot ETH ETFs, bringing the total to nearly $1.1 billion over just four trading days, marking the strongest run since their launch last July. Put it all together: Futures positioning is holding strong, spot inflows are ramping. Clearly, someone’s leaning in while the broader market hesitates. Could this be a move the rest of the market hasn’t priced in yet? For the first time ever, Ethereum’s strategic reserves have crossed $4 billion, with 1.11% of the supply now concentrated in just 50 entities. BlackRock’s latest buy of 50,970 ETH worth $150 million only adds fuel to the narrative. And it might not be random timing. The ETH/BTC ratio has posted two straight green candles, hinting that as Bitcoin [BTC] struggles at resistance, capital could be quietly rotating into Ethereum. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) The divergence shows up in the data, too. Bitcoin’s Open Interest has dropped 3.72%, with the price now 5% off its $122k high. Meanwhile, ETH has kept its OI drawdown to just 2%, showing more stability under pressure. If that relative strength holds, Ethereum could be setting up for another leg higher, using this 2% dip as a springboard for a breakout above $3,000.

World President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he leaves the White House, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Washington. (Photo: AP/Manuel Balce Ceneta) PITTSBURGH: US President Donald Trump will join executives from leading technology and energy firms at a high-profile summit in Pittsburgh on Tuesday (Jul 15), as the White House accelerates plans to boost artificial intelligence (AI) and expand data centre infrastructure. The Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, brings together top officials from Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, ExxonMobil and others, amid intensifying global competition with China over AI dominance. Trump is expected to announce some US$90 billion in AI and energy investments in Pennsylvania during the event, which was organized by US Senator Dave McCormick, a key Republican ally. The president will unveil commitments from major corporations including Google, CoreWeave, and Blackstone. McCormick told attendees the stakes "couldn’t be higher", warning that if the US failed to lead in AI, it could cede control over infrastructure and technology to Beijing. "We will hand control of our infrastructure, our data, our leadership and our way of life to the Chinese Communist Party," he said. Amid soaring demand, Big Tech companies are racing to secure enough power to run energy-intensive data centres. Google announced a US$3 billion deal to acquire up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower from Brookfield Asset Management. The 20-year power purchase agreements will support electricity generation at two facilities in Pennsylvania. Cloud service provider CoreWeave also announced plans for a US$6 billion AI data centre, while asset manager Blackstone committed US$25 billion to building data centres and energy infrastructure across the state. Other executives in attendance include Mubadala CEO Khaldoon Al-Mubarak, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, Bechtel CEO Brendan Bechtel and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. The White House is weighing executive actions in the coming weeks to ease infrastructure development for AI. These include simplifying connections between energy projects and the grid, allocating federal land for data centres, and creating a nationwide Clean Water Act permit to streamline approval for AI infrastructure. Trump, who has declared AI a top national priority, ordered the creation of a comprehensive AI Action Plan in January. The plan, developed with input from the National Security Council, is due by Jul 23. He is expected to mark the occasion with a major speech titled "Winning the AI Race", organised by White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks and co-hosts from the All-In podcast. The surge in AI activity is pushing US electricity consumption to record highs. To meet demand, energy companies and tech firms are striking new deals, such as a proposed plan by Microsoft and Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. This growing demand has sparked concerns about power shortages, rising electricity bills, and potential blackouts that could disrupt the tech sector’s momentum in its race with global competitors like China.

Title: JPMorgan to test stablecoin services alongside proprietary deposit token in bid to speed settlements

Jamie Dimon framed the decision as defensive, as fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on a July 15 earnings call that the bank will launch products tied to stablecoins and its deposit coin as part of a broader payments strategy. As CNBC reported, Dimon said the firm “will be involved” in both formats to master the technology and protect market share. Dimon framed the decision as defensive. He said fintech companies already design products that mimic checking accounts, payments networks, and loyalty platforms. Furthermore, JPMorgan’s CEO added that the firm must engage rather than watch. Citigroup executives said during their call on the same day that the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin” and sees immediate utility in tokenized deposits and digital‑asset custody. Bank of America chief Brian Moynihan has signaled similar intentions. Executives floated a joint effort through Early Warning Services, the consortium behind Zelle, although Dimon declined to confirm any collaboration plans, saying only that the bank weighs “all that.” Dimon’s remarks echo BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who told investors that the asset manager sees a “great untapped opportunity” in stablecoins for clients seeking digital access to Treasuries and other cash instruments. Fink cited the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill that aims to establish a federal framework for stablecoin issuance, adding that it could accelerate the adoption of stablecoins. Dimon remains critical of Bitcoin but views stablecoins as practical extensions of existing payment infrastructure. A retail‑facing stablecoin would broaden settlement options to a broader customer base and, once regulations permit, operate across multiple blockchains. Regulatory clarity motivates the shift. The House of Representatives plans a vote on the GENIUS Act later this week, and senators have signaled support for rules that slot stablecoin issuers under bank supervision. Furthermore, Dimon acknowledged that failing to act could allow non‑banks to capture cross‑border flows and merchant payments: “You know, these guys are very smart. They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that. And the way to be cognizant is to be involved.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Gardaí contacted over 950 times since school abuse appeal
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0715/1523688-historical-abuse-schools/

Barry Lenihan Gardaí have been contacted more than 950 times since their appeal last September relating to historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders. The updated figure came as the Dáil debated plans for a Commission of Investigation into historical abuse in schools, first announced by Minister for Education Helen McEntee last Tuesday. David Ryan, who featured in the Blackrock Boys documentary which led to the Commission's ultimate announcement, was among those in the Dáil to witness the debate. Speaking on his way into Leinster House, Mr Ryan said he hoped survivors would get justice in the years ahead. He carried a framed picture of his late brother Mark - who featured in the same documentary - into the Houses of the Oireachtas with him. "It's a very momentous day for me. I wish Mark was with me as he would have been in his element to come in here. I thought this would never happen. It's sad and good at the same time, so I'm happy," Mr Ryan told RTÉ's Drivetime programme. "The last week has been a bit of rollercoaster since I heard what Minister McEntee was going to do. Other people can get their justice and they should be proud of themselves to come forward. It's frightening to find out how many people were abused in this country, it's just frightening," he said. Last September, a scoping inquiry found that there were 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse in relation to 308 schools recorded by the religious orders that ran the schools. The allegations were made about 884 distinct alleged abusers. The inquiry recommended last week's announcement of a Commission of Investigation. In a statement to RTÉ, An Garda Síochána said it had received over 950 contacts around historical sexual abuse at schools run by religious orders since the publication of the scoping inquiry. However, a spokesperson added how not all contacts could be acted upon. "An Garda Síochána (has) highlighted that while An Garda Síochána would endeavour to effectively deal with all contacts, there was likely to be limitations as to the action that could be taken in some cases due to matters such as unavailability of evidence over time or suspects and/or witnesses being deceased." Speaking in the Dáil, Ms McEntee reiterated plans to use all levers possible to ensure religious orders contribute to a planned redress scheme for survivors. She also commended those who have shared their stories to date and confirmed the Commission will commence work in the coming months. © RTÉ 2025.

European shares ended lower on Tuesday, dragged down by heavyweight financial and healthcare stocks as investors awaited news on a potential US-EU trade deal while assessing the latest US inflation data. DUBLIN The Iseq All-Share index ended the session narrowly in the black, up 0.06 per cent at 11,262.29, on Tuesday. Hotel group Dalata closed down 2.6 per cent to €6.37 after a Scandinavian consortium reached an agreement to buy the business for €1.4 billion.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 dropped 0.7 per cent to 8,938.32, having crossed the 9,000 mark for the first time earlier in the day, while the domestically oriented FTSE 250 index fell 0.2 per cent. British stocks have largely shrugged off concerns about chaotic US trade policies, with the UK being the first country to secure a trade deal with the United States. Among individual stocks, GSK fell 1.5 per cent after the US Food and Drug Administration raised safety concerns that the drugmaker’s blood cancer drug Blenrep, when used in combination with other treatments, may cause eye damage in patients. Experian rose 4.3 per cent after the credit data firm reported 8 per cent organic revenue growth in its first quarter and reaffirmed its annual forecasts. Britain’s largest home builder Barratt Redrow slumped 8.9 per cent after it said home completions missed expectations for fiscal 2025. EUROPE The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.36 per cent. Several big European defence stocks were weaker after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose stiff economic penalties on Russia if it doesn’t end hostilities with Ukraine within 50 days. The threat came as he pledged fresh weapons supplies for Kyiv. Rheinmetall dropped 2.77 per cent and Dassault Aviation fell 2.47 per cent. In the euro zone, the banking index slipped 1.1 per cent. Germany’s Commerzbank, Italy’s Banco BPM and France’s Société Générale each fell more than 2 per cent Healthcare also lagged, with Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk sliding 2.3 per cent.

Accelleron rose 8.7 per cent to a record high after the engine components maker increased its revenue forecast for 2025. NEW YORK The Nasdaq cruised to a fresh record high in midafternoon trading on Tuesday, powered by a jump in Nvidia, while the S&P 500 hovered below its peak as investors digested an inflation report and a flurry of big bank earnings. AI-chip leader Nvidia was higher after unveiling plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China. Other chipmakers also advanced, including Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer. The gains led the technology sector to a record high. JPMorgan Chase slipped despite raising its 2025 net interest income outlook, while Wells Fargo fell even as its profit rose on reduced loan-loss reserves. BlackRock notched a new milestone, managing a record $12.53 trillion in assets amid optimism over trade deals and rate cuts, yet its shares were also weaker. The KBW Bank Index sank to a two-week low, but Citigroup bucked the trend by climbing after its traders delivered a windfall that boosted second-quarter profits. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: How Texas Bullied Big Banks Into Dropping Their Climate Commitments

Full Content:
By Lauren Windsor Speaking to a private gathering of conservative operatives and fossil fuel advocates in January, a top deputy to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton gave “the inside story” about how his office bullied Wells Fargo, one of America’s biggest banks, into dropping out of a global initiative to reduce carbon emissions. The official spoke in January at the exclusive Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has exclusively obtained audio and documents from the event. Brent Webster, the First Assistant Attorney General of Texas, recalled how his office moved to cut off lucrative bond business to Wells Fargo. Webster then shared how he, in a private dinner at the governor’s mansion with Gov. Greg Abbott, Paxton, and the bank’s execs, told the bank Texas could “reinstate the bond market” if it left the Net Zero Banking Alliance. When the Wells Fargo team got flustered, Webster said he threatened an antitrust lawsuit against them, telling the bank’s executives they were this close “to being sued right now.” After the Texas attorney general launched an antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock and other large asset management firms, Webster said he called up his contact at Wells Fargo and warned, “you guys might be next.” It worked: “They left a week later,” he said. “They left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and then all the banks followed.” On the plus side for the banks, once they left the alliance, Paxton allowed them to get municipal bond business again. Paxton’s office did not respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment. In a statement, Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild, who interviewed Webster at the event, said that the organization is “appalled at the lengths that Wall Street’s financial cartels will go to defend their tyranny over consumers,” adding that “we are proud of the courageous work that Brent Webster and Attorney General Paxton’s office have done fighting for Americans against such antitrust abuse. If big banks and asset managers like BlackRock think that they can intimidate those who oppose their misdeeds into silence … they are mistaken.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Consumers’ Research, a one-time watchdog group that now works to limit consumer protections, has led the fight against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, with support from Supreme Court puppetmaster and billion-dollar money man Leonard Leo. The organization and Leo have worked in coalition with Republican attorneys general, state financial officers, legislators, and national Republican groups to pressure businesses to drop public commitments to ensuring the future habitability of our planet. Major ESG initiatives undertaken by Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo and BlackRock include membership in global groups like the Net Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managers, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. These clean energy alliances became key targets, and ultimately casualties, in conservatives’ “war on woke.” Of course, corporate climate pledges, like the one from the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and ESG were nowhere close to solving the global climate crisis. The banks never stopped funding the fossil fuel industry. That hasn’t stopped conservatives — ranging from Donald Trump, Republican state officials, and dark money interests — from waging an all-out war on these concepts regardless, in an effort to ensure that no one with any institutional power at all prioritizes climate action. Related Content Jordan Klepper Charts Trump’s Long History With Jeffrey Epstein on ‘The Daily Show’ Why the Trump Administration Is About to Set Fire to 500 Tons of Emergency Food Speaker Mike Johnson Splits From Trump, Calls for Release of Epstein Files What Trump Has Said About Jeffrey Epstein Over the Years Webster made clear how easy it is to weaponize the legal apparatus of the state to bring the financial industry to its knees. He urged his allies to do the same: “Anybody who has power over state enforcers or influence over state subpoena power … states should be ramping up right now.” As part of their anti-ESG fight, conservatives have argued that, by participating in clean energy alliances, financiers have engaged in illegal boycotts and manipulation of the energy markets, and breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders and retirees to prioritize investment returns above all else. They have led an efficient and thorough campaign. Conservative think tanks like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Heritage Action wrote model bills; state legislators affiliated with the American Legislative Exchange (ALEC) worked to pass those bills; upon passage, state treasurers and investment officials in the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and Republican attorneys general used these laws to launch enforcement actions; and everyone kept up the drumbeat of attack. Texas, for instance, passed the nation’s first law banning banks from the municipal bond business if they are found to be discriminating against the fossil fuel industry. Attorneys general have also weaponized federal antitrust laws to launch “unsubstantiated” attacks “against climate initiatives,” as several partners at the law firm Wilson Sonsini put it in an article published earlier this year by Thomson Reuters. “At bottom, these are nothing more than political attacks, and the courts should quickly end the misuse of the antitrust laws for this political purpose,” they wrote.In his fireside chat with Hild, from Consumers’ Research, Webster gave a basic outline of his role in initiating Texas’ antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock for allegedly conspiring with coal companies in its investment portfolio to shut down coal production. Hild wanted more information — the backstory to explain why, after Texas filed suit against BlackRock and asset managers, “within weeks, what might seem unrelated at first,” big banks like Wells Fargo “start dropping like flies” from the Net Zero Banking Alliance. It produced a domino effect, with BlackRock leaving Net Zero Asset Managers, which subsequently ceased all activities.Webster replied, “We’re not recording this, right? … Please don’t quote me, because I’m telling the inside story on this.” He then described the leverage he had against Wall Street: potential enforcement actions that could end lucrative profit streams for the banks, and the possibility of long, painful lawsuits. “They’re all deathly afraid of being sued,” Webster said, explaining: “None of them want to be subject to depositions. None of them want to be subject to discovery.” Leo’s network has long been the top funder of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which works to elect GOP attorneys general.. Marble Freedom Trust is the primary vehicle through which Leo disburses the $1.6 billion bequeathed to him from billionaire industrialist Barre Seid for the purpose of waging the right-wing movement’s culture war. Seid secretly gifted his surge protector empire to Leo’s dark money trust, before the business sold, creating a historic political advocacy fund for conservatives. According to The Wall Street Journal, Leo’s Marble Freedom Trust and his consulting firm CRC Advisors have pumped millions into anti-ESG efforts, with much of it going through Consumers’ Research. CRC Advisors played an active role in the Sea Island event. In planning documents from the Sea Island Resort obtained by Rolling Stone, Maria Marshall, a top Leo lieutenant at CRC Advisors, was listed as the point of contact for billing. A key cog in Leo’s network, the 85 Fund, was listed as the account holder. While the 85 Fund moved its corporate registration to Texas in 2023, the planning documents still listed its address in Washington, D.C., at the same building where Leo’s organizations have long operated. Consumers’ Research was originally founded nearly a century ago, in 1929. Just six years after its founding, its workers split to form Consumers Union, which produces the well-regarded Consumer Reports magazine. Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research would denounce unions as communist and the group became a shill for the tobacco industry. The group was mostly dormant from 2002 to 2013, when it began advocating for conservative causes in court briefs, based on secret funding from Seid, according to leaked documents. Seid was eventually revealed to be the largest funder of Leo’s agenda. Since 2020, Consumers’ Research has focused on fighting ESG investing and “woke capitalism,” with aggressive million-dollar ad campaigns, research reports, and outreach to officials with any leverage over Wall Street. Some of the anti-ESG coalition’s biggest partners were in attendance at the Consumers’ Research summit, including representatives from ALEC, Heritage Action, and SFOF. These organizations have all received funding from entities tied to Leo. According to an analysis from Democracy Forward, the Leo network was ALEC’s largest known donor in 2023. The same year, Hild, Consumers’ Research’s director, said that Consumers’ Research was the largest donor to SFOF. For the past several years, as the Biden administration pursued greater action on climate change, Wall Street sought both to hedge its financial risks, and profit from new financial products touting ESG investing and diversity, equity, and inclusion — marketing them to the climate and socially conscious consumer. ESG assesses a company or investment decisions through a sustainability framework, in order to bolster long-term growth and reduce harm. Socially responsible investing has existed in various forms for decades and was implemented by many banks and pension funds through the 2010s, but it really became mainstream during the Biden administration, as climate change took on a renewed urgency. Left-wing critics of ESG say these products are merely a fig leaf helping Wall Street evade regulatory oversight and greenwash their continued investments in the fossil fuel industry, and there is some truth to this. Take for example, a chief target of the Leo coalition — BlackRock, the biggest pension fund manager in the world, with $12.5 trillion in assets under management. BlackRock has been at the forefront of ESG evangelism, while at the same time holding $400 billion in fossil fuel industry investments. Right-wing critics argue that financial performance should be the only factor driving investment consideration. Though conservatives decry ESG as free market malpractice harming the almighty shareholder profit, studies by McKinsey and Bain & Company have found that ESG boosts financial performance. On a broader level, of course, allowing for maximum climate devastation will be both immensely costly for the citizens of Earth, as well as for business interests. At one point at the Consumers’ Research summit, Webster spoke about the push to have Republican-led states end any investments with BlackRock, arguing that currently, “red states are funding the war against us.” Webster acknowledged that some state investment officials managing retirement funds for public employees have been uncomfortable with the idea of ending their arrangements with BlackRock, on the basis that it could hurt their retirement systems’ finances. “The biggest problem we have right now is both of our retirement funds, and I’m sure, I’m glad I’m not being quoted here, but they do not have the courage to stand up to BlackRock,” he said. He argued that’s why Republican governors and other officials with control over state retirement systems must appoint people to those systems who view BlackRock as a problem.

Title: Woman (80) awarded €60,000 after social life impacted by trip on footpath

Full Content:
An 80-year-old woman has been awarded just short of €60,000 damages by a judge who said her social life had been greatly impacted by injuries she suffered when she tripped and fell on a hazardous footpath. Judge Terence O’Sullivan said Anita Bryan, a keen golfer, of Somerton, Rochestown Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, had suffered bad injuries to her left wrist and right knee, causing her to abandon golf at her club, Woodenbridge in Arklow, Co Wicklow. “I haven’t played golf for five years because I am unable to walk for the four hours plus that it would take to complete a round,” Ms Bryan told the Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday. Barrister Damian Sheridan, who appeared with Murphy McElligott Solicitors for Ms Bryan, told the court she had tripped on the raised edge of a pavement slab outside Cavistons Food Emporium on the Glasthule Road, Sandycove, Co Dublin, on the day before Christmas Eve, 2019. Ms Bryan said she had been walking arm-in-arm with her husband when her shoe caught on the slab, catapulting her forward. She had fallen and broken her left wrist and suffered a displaced fracture of the right patella of her right knee. “The pain was dreadful and my wrist and leg were put in casts at the hospital. I was in a wheelchair for six weeks,” she told the judge. Ms Bryan said she had received eight cortisone injections and was awaiting more for her knee injury. “I cannot kneel properly any more and one of my favourite hobbies, apart from golf, was gardening,” she said. She sued Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Cavistons Food Emporium, which the local authority let out of the proceeding without blame. The judge told barrister Kevin Callan, counsel for Northstone Construction, Blackrock, Co Dublin, that his client was not liable for the incident. Forensic engineer Alan Conlan said he had examined the footpath shortly after the incident and found one of the slabs loose and rocking. The edge of the slab was raised above the level of other pavement slabs that had later been repaired. “The loose slab was a potential trip hazard,” he said. Awarding Ms Bryan €59,250, barely short of the €60,000 maximum jurisdiction of the court, against the local authority, Judge O’Sullivan said she had suffered bad injuries and had not overstated her claim in any way. “I feel that on the balance of probability that works to the footpath had to have been carried out by the local authority and nobody else,” the judge said. “Ms Bryan was a truthful witness and her life has been severely impacted by the accident. There is no question of contributory negligence.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A new weekly “On Chain” report from Bank of America is shining a spotlight on Ethereum. According to the report, the network is set to draw steady interest from stablecoin investors as lawmakers in Washington take up crypto bills in Congress. Ethereum’s role as the home for over 50% of all dollar‑pegged coins has caught the eyes of big banks and asset managers alike. Based on reports, this week’s Crypto Week in the US House of Representatives could reshape the stablecoin sector. Lawmakers are debating three major bills: the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance bill. House Financial Services Chair French Hill told a “Think Crypto” podcast that dollar‑backed coins would solidify the US dollar’s global lead. If Congress backs clear rules, the rails that already carry the most volumes could see fresh inflows. BofA launches new weekly periodical ‘On Chain,’ designed to “drill into the various facets of the fast-evolving digital assets ecosystem.” First call: Bullish ETH pic.twitter.com/sERRZiTgMq — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) July 14, 2025 Bank of America called out infrastructure providers like Stripe and the Ethereum network as prime plays for anyone looking to get stablecoin exposure. That nod isn’t just for the token itself. It’s a bet on the whole stack—wallets, apps and payment tools that ride on Ethereum’s code. Investors who pick up Ether now could tap growing on‑chain activity as stablecoin use climbs. The report also mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that the dollar‑pegged stablecoin market may swell to $2 trillion in the next five years. That forecast has fund managers circling the charts. Thomas Lee, Fundstart CIO and new chairman of BitMine, even dubbed stablecoins the “ChatGPT of crypto.” His firm now holds Ether in its treasury. The move shows how big players are gearing up for a stablecoin surge on Ethereum. Other sectors are racing alongside stablecoins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said tokenization could expand 4,000 times over time. He sees on‑chain assets tied to real‑world items booming soon. Some say XRP and Ether are the go‑to tokens for that play. But Ethereum already has the advantage of scale. It isn’t all smooth sailing. Regulation could tighten or split along different chains. New networks chase faster speeds and lower fees. That competition could chip away at Ethereum’s lead. Still, the network’s mix of smart‑contract tools and high stablecoin volumes gives it a strong head start. For now, plenty of eyes are on Congress and on‑chain data. If US lawmakers set clear stablecoin rules, Ethereum may keep its crown as the top hub. Investors looking for exposure will likely track Ether flows and watch the bills as they move through committee. The weeks ahead could spell out the next big chapter for the network.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: WATCH LIVE: Trump plugs energy agenda at Pennsylvania innovation summit

Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press Leave your feedback PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump touted tens of billions of dollars of recent energy and technology investments Tuesday in Pennsylvania while boasting of a “true golden age for America” in energy policy and artificial intelligence. Trump traveled to Pittsburgh at a summit helmed by Republican Sen. David McCormick that included dozens of top executives from companies aiming to make the city and the state a hot spot for advancements in robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. McCormick announced more than $90 billion of investments in the state — spurring tens of thousands of jobs — although some of the projects had already been in progress ahead of the summit. Watch Trump’s remarks live in our video player above. “I think we have a true golden age for America. And we’ve been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world,” Trump said at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University. “I’m honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I’m honored to be in Pittsburgh. And you’re going to see some real action here. So get ready.” Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. Both the president and senior administration officials on Tuesday framed the investments as part of a race against China for the most advanced deployment of artificial intelligence, with Trump saying, “We are way ahead of China, I have to say.” “China and other countries are racing to catch up to America on AI, and we’re not going to let them do it,” Trump said during the hourlong roundtable held in a university gymnasium, speaking often from prepared notes. Flanked by several of his Cabinet members, company executives and local political leaders, Trump added that the U.S. will be “fighting them in a very friendly fashion.” WATCH: Trump rolled back energy tax credits for homeowners and developers. Here’s what that means for you Before Trump spoke, his Cabinet members spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the AI race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during an earlier panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand-new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects — such as a $15 billion project in central Pennsylvania — while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.

Here are some ways to lower your electric bill Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant, and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in south-central Pennsylvania. Blackstone plans to spend $25 billion on data centers and building new natural gas-fired power plants in northeastern Pennsylvania, and the company will start construction by the end of 2028, said Jon Gray, its CEO. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. “What’s exciting about this event is it’s a great catalyst for investments and closing deals in the region,” said Jake Loosararian, the founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called AI Avenue that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms.

Title: 5 stats that show where BlackRock is — and where the world's largest asset manager is going
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-earnings-call-key-stats-showing-trajectory-larry-fink-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-07-15T14:58:57Z
Full Content:
There are lots of big numbers that come up on BlackRock earnings calls. It's what happens when you're the largest asset manager in the world. The key thing for investors in the firm and competitors tracking the behemoth from afar is deciphering which of the gaudy current-day figures will keep growing and which of the optimistic projections will actually happen. BlackRock already manages $12.5 trillion in assets across institutions, insurers, pensions, and wealthy people, mostly in public markets. It's spent the last year and a half acquiring businesses that would help it move more of that money into lucrative private markets, where fees are higher and capital is stickier. At its investor day last month, the firm laid out its goal to hit $35 billion in annual revenue in 2030, an increase from $20 billion in 2024. Business Insider highlighted five stats from the firm's Tuesday call with analysts to demonstrate asset manager is currently and where it hopes to be in five years. The net inflows into BlackRock products in the first half. The influx of assets was led by a record six months from the firm's iShares ETF line, which brought in a net $192 billion of new money. BlackRock's existing business, particularly its low-fee index investing funds, is the biggest pile of money in the industry and is still growing consistently. Still, the first half of the year was not perfect, as some of the firm's actively traded products experienced a performance dip. The decline in performance fees collected by BlackRock in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024. Rocky equity and bond markets worldwide, caused primarily by the trade policies proposed by President Donald Trump, have been challenging for investors of all sizes to deal with. At BlackRock, the firm's profit margin dipped to 43.3% this quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's second quarter, and CFO Martin Small attributed 75% of that drop to the decline in performance fees. Active equity funds in particular have had a rough 12-month stretch, the firm's earnings supplement shows: Only 40% of assets are above the index or peer median. The firm also noted that private market funds brought in fewer performance fees than last year, but the firm's ambitions for that space remain as large as ever. The amount of revenue HPS Investment Partners is expected to add to BlackRock's coffers in the third quarter, according to Small. The deal for the $165 billion private credit shop closed at the start of July, and Small said the firm will issue the equivalent of up to 13.8 million shares of BlackRock common stock to retain the team at the firm. The retention of HPS's team will be critical for BlackRock, which wants to fundraise significantly for its private-credit and infrastructure offerings over the next five years. The fundraising goal for private market fundraising through 2030. Small said he expects it to ramp up in 2028 as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners, the firm's other large private market investor acquisition, become more ingrained in the firm. CEO Larry Fink said that he was in Asia last week, where demand for infrastructure and other private-public partnerships is already "beyond our imagination." Those partnerships — the firm has pulled in Singapore's Temasek in its artificial intelligence infrastructure push — will be needed if the manager hopes to hit its revenue goals. The proportion of the firm's revenue that it wants to derive from its private markets funds and tech services platform, led by Aladdin, by 2030. The New York-based firm made nearly $10.7 billion in revenue in 2025's first half, driven by its equity ETFs, which hauled in $2.8 billion in revenue alone. Tech services, meanwhile, made roughly a third of that in the same time frame. BlackRock's Aladdin platform already serves more than 200 institutional clients, effectively making the firm an infrastructure provider to many of its clients and some of its competitors. But the firm's fundraising push for its private market offerings also includes the hope that individual retirement accounts in the US will soon be open to such options. Fink and Small both said that litigation reform is needed before that could happen, but are optimistic about what they've heard out of Washington on the subject. "We think we have all the building blocks here," Small said. Correction July 15, 2025: An earlier version of this story misstated BlackRock's revenue target for its private markets and technology businesses by 2030. The goal is for these segments to account for 30% of the firm's revenue, not 40%. Jump to

Title: Solana RWAs surge 217% hitting $553 million in real world assets as memecoins lose focus
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/solana-rwas-surge-217-to-hit-553-million-in-real-world-assets-as-memecoins-lose-focus/

Solana's RWA ecosystem grows over 600% in user adoption, solidifying its position as a high-performance blockchain challenger. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA) market surpassed $550 million and rocketed up 217% year-to-date in 2025. The explosive growth, more than double the pace of the broader market, positions the high-speed blockchain as a serious challenger to Ethereum’s long-held dominance in one of crypto’s most promising sectors. As of press time, Solana has reached $558 million to take third place behind ZKsync Era and Ethereum per rwa.xyz. The numbers behind Solana’s recent ascent in the RWA space are impressive. While the overall market for tokenized assets grew by a respectable 61% this year, Solana’s ecosystem expanded at more than three times that rate. This momentum is fueled by both institutional-grade protocols and a groundswell of retail interest. Key protocols like Ondo Finance and ONe’s institutional fund are leading the charge, collectively accounting for approximately $276 million, or around half of Solana’s non-stablecoin RWA value. However, the most dramatic growth metric comes from user adoption. In a recent 30-day period, the number of unique wallets holding tokenized stocks on Solana surged by an astonishing 684%, jumping from just 7,400 to over 58,000. This rapid adoption is a direct result of Solana’s core architecture. The network’s reputation for high throughput and near-zero transaction costs, famously battle-tested during the memecoin frenzies of late 2024, has created a hyper-efficient environment. What was once seen as a “degen” playground has proven its capacity to handle massive transaction volumes, over 200 million daily at its peak, with over 16 months of uninterrupted uptime. This proven performance is now attracting serious RWA projects that require speed and low fees to manage the complex lifecycle of a tokenized asset. To understand the significance of Solana’s rise, it must be viewed against the industry’s giants. Ethereum remains the undisputed king of RWAs, commanding a 58.4% market share with a colossal $7.7 billion in tokenized value. ZKsync Era is next in line with $2.2 billion and a 17% market share. Yet, a clear divergence in momentum is emerging. In the last 30 days, Ethereum’s and second-place ZKsync Era’s RWA value grew by a sluggish 3.6% and 0.9%, respectively, while Solana’s jumped by 22.3% to reach 4.2% market share and overtake Aptos. The ultimate institutional litmus test is BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the largest tokenized Treasury fund with approximately $2.8 billion in assets under management. While the vast majority of BUIDL resides on Ethereum, BlackRock’s strategic decision to expand the fund onto Solana is a powerful vote of confidence. This move, which has already brought over $25.2 million of BUIDL to the network, validates Solana’s infrastructure. It also signals a sophisticated multi-chain strategy from major institutions, which are beginning to use high-performance chains like Solana as efficient “distribution outposts” for trading and utilizing assets that are custodied on Ethereum. Beyond the headline applications, Solana’s long-term RWA strategy is being solidified by crucial, foundational infrastructure development, the “picks and shovels” needed to build a trillion-dollar market. A landmark integration with enterprise blockchain R3 Corda is a key example. According to Messari, this partnership allows institutions using R3’s trusted, private ledger to tap into the Solana public blockchain for final settlement. It’s a “best of both worlds” approach that bridges private enterprise assets with the liquidity and efficiency of a public chain, positioning Solana as a potential universal settlement layer. Furthermore, a new partnership between the public company DeFi Dev Corp. and oracle provider Switchboard aims to build RWA-specific oracles on Solana. As Messari Research Analyst Matthew Nay notes, “Solana’s appeal stems from its high throughput, near-zero transaction costs, and robust developer ecosystem.” However, for institutions to trust on-chain assets, they need reliable, verifiable data feeds that connect to off-chain value. This focus on building a robust data infrastructure is a critical step toward winning institutional trust and unlocking the next wave of tokenization. The institutional RWA narrative and Solana’s retail-tested performance have created a potent combination. Solana is rapidly transitioning from a network known for its speculative hype cycles into a serious contender for the future of finance. While significant hurdles remain, including historical concerns about network stability and the unresolved legal challenges facing the entire RWA sector, the momentum is undeniable. With its technical advantages, explosive growth, and a growing seal of approval from a giant like BlackRock, Solana has become a key protagonist in the story of how trillions in traditional assets will ultimately move on-chain.

July 15, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited and its CEO and CIO, Bob Elliott, today rolled out two new actively managed ETFs: the Unlimited HFMF Managed Futures ETF (HFMF) and the Unlimited HFEQ Equity Long/Short ETF (HFEQ), offering investors exposure to managed futures and equity long/short hedge fund strategies, respectively. These latest additions to the Unlimited lineup align with Unlimited’s mission to provide investors with access to transparent, liquid, and cost-effective hedge fund-style returns. These new strategies will allocate across a diversified basket of ETFs and exchange-listed futures contracts, adjusting dynamically based on evolving market conditions. Today’s launch expands Unlimited’s ETF roster to cover the primary hedge fund strategy sectors. “With the addition of our Managed Futures and Equity Long/Short strategies, Unlimited now offers complementary strategies to help achieve diversification in a wide range of investor portfolios,” said Mr. Elliott. “Deploying these strategies in the ETF wrapper, which offers intraday liquidity, affords the manager flexibility to adjust through volatile markets.” Each of Unlimited’s sector ETFs were designed to offer a volatility target aligned with equity markets as an investor-friendly way to add the diversification features of alternatives to a balanced portfolio: Over time, high fees and inefficient tax structures in hedge funds erode returns, and top tier private funds are often inaccessible to the majority of investors. Unlimited developed proprietary machine learning technology to analyze near real-time hedge fund investment returns and efficiently replicate the underlying exposures while maintaining an expense ratio significantly lower than the standard “2 & 20” hedge fund fee model. Unlimited’s ETFs are managed by Mr. Elliott, former investment committee member at Bridgewater Associates, and Bruce McNevin, co-founder and Chief Data Scientist at Unlimited. Mr. McNevin brings extensive experience in quantitative modeling and data science. For more information on Unlimited HFMF, HFEQ, HFGM and HFND please visit https://www.unlimitedetfs.com/. About UnlimitedFounded in 2022 by Bob Elliott, Bruce McNevin and Matt Salzberg, Unlimited is an investment firm using proprietary technology to create strategies that offer lower-cost access to 2 & 20-style alternative investment strategies, such as hedge funds, to a wide range of investors. Mr. Elliott has built innovative hedge fund strategies for more than two decades, including at Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. Mr. McNevin is a Professor of Economics at New York University and has held various data science positions at hedge funds Clinton Group and Midway Group, along with positions at Bank of America and BlackRock.

Media Contacts: Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus. A prospectus may be obtained by visiting www.unlimitedetfs.com. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest. Important RisksUnderlying ETFs Risks. The Fund will incur higher and duplicative expenses because it invests in Underlying ETFs. There is also the risk that the Fund may suffer losses due to the investment practices of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of securities held by the Underlying ETFs. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. Machine Learning, Model and Data Risk. The Fund relies heavily on proprietary “machine learning” selection processes. In addition, the composition of the Fund’s portfolio is heavily dependent on proprietary quantitative models as well as information and data supplied by third parties (“Models and Data”). Volatility Risk. The Fund seeks to achieve a higher level of volatility than its target hedge fund industry sector, which may result in substantial price fluctuations over short periods. As a result, the value of the Fund’s investments may rise or fall significantly, and investors should be prepared for increased levels of volatility compared to traditionalequity funds. Commodity Risk. Underlying ETFs that invest in the commodities markets may subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Derivatives Risk. The Fund’s or an Underlying ETF’s derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets or index; the loss of principal, including the potential loss of amounts greater than the initial amount invested in the derivative instrument; the possible default of the other party to the transaction; and illiquidity of the derivative investments. Emerging Markets Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in securities issued by companies domiciled or headquartered in emerging market nations. Investments in securities traded in developing or emerging markets, or that provide exposure to such securities or markets, can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, currency, or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in U.S. securities and investments in more developed international markets. Fixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that invest in fixed income securities. The prices of fixed income securities may be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness and financial strength of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing fixed income securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration and/or higher quality fixed income securities. Foreign Securities Risk. Foreign securities held by Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Futures Contracts Risk. The Fund or Underlying ETFs may invest in futures contracts.Risks of futures contracts include: (i) an imperfect correlation between the value of the futures contract and the underlying asset; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market; (iii) the inability to close a futures contract when desired; (iv) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which may be unlimited; (v) an obligation for the Fund or an Underlying ETF, as applicable, to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin, particularly at times when the Fund or Underlying ETF may have insufficient cash; and (vi) unfavorable execution prices from rapid selling. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Short Selling Risk. The Fund may make short sales of securities of Underlying ETFs, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the price of the security will decline. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage. Short sales expose the Fund to the risk that it will be required to buy (“cover”) the security sold short when the security has appreciated in value or is unavailable, thus resulting in a loss to the Fund. Short sales also involve the risk that losses may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited. Swap Agreement Risk. The Fund or an Underlying ETF may invest in swap agreements. Swap agreements could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated. Swaps can have the potential for unlimited losses. They are also subject to counterparty risk. If the counterparty fails to meet its obligations, the Fund (or the Underlying Fund) may lose money. Definitions:2 & 20 strategy: Describes the standard fee structure charged by advisers of private funds, which generally includes a 2% asset-based management fee, in addition to a 20% performance fee charged on the profits on investments.

Title: Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick team up to promote energy investments in Pennsylvania
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/15/trump-energy-investments-pennsylvania-visit/
Time Published: 2025-07-15T12:02:04Z

By SEUNG MIN KIM and MARC LEVY, Associated Press PITTSBURGH (AP) — President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania touted tens of billions of dollars of energy and technology investments Tuesday as the president traveled to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, held at Carnegie Mellon University, comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal and gas industry that the Republican administration has taken steps to bolster. At the summit, Trump Cabinet officials spoke of the need to produce as much energy as possible — especially from coal and natural gas — to beat China in the artificial intelligence race for the sake of economic and national security. “The AI revolution is upon us,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said during a panel discussion. “The Trump administration will not let us lose. We need to do clean, beautiful coal. We need to do natural gas, we need to embrace nuclear, we need to embrace it all because we have the power to do it and if we don’t do it we’re fools.” Some of the investments on a list released by McCormick’s office were not necessarily brand new, while others were. Some involve massive data center projects, while others involve building power plants, expanding natural gas pipelines, upgrading power plants or improving electricity transmission networks. Google said it would invest $25 billion on AI and data center infrastructure over the next two years in PJM’s mid-Atlantic electricity grid, while investment firm Brookfield said it had signed contracts to provide more than $3 billion of power to Google’s data centers from two hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. Blackstone said it will spend $25 billion on data centers and power infrastructure in northeastern Pennsylvania, Frontier Group said it would transform the former Bruce Mansfield coal-fired power plant in western Pennsylvania into a new natural gas-fired plant and AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave said it will spend more than $6 billion to equip a data center in southcentral Pennsylvania. McCormick, a first-term Republican senator who organized the inaugural event, said the summit was meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, Bridgewater, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, also spoke. Administration officials speaking at the summit included White House crypto czar David Sacks, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Lutnick. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also attended. McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “ AI Avenue ” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. “What’s going on is a rewiring of the economy, of the world over the next 15 years and that takes trillions and trillions and tens of trillions of dollars and it starts with power,” said Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield, during a panel discussion. Pennsylvania has scored big investment wins in recent months, some driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, while the one-time Homer City coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pa.

Title: BlackRock's assets hit record $12.53 trillion: What's fuelling the surge?

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced a significant surge in its assets under management (AUM), reaching a new high of $12.53 trillion in the second quarter of 2025. This AUM growth, up from $10.65 trillion last year, is primarily driven by a global market rally, fuelled by the prospect of trade deals and interest-rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, brushing aside earlier tariff-related jitters. The shares of the company rose 1.1 per cent in premarket trading after the announcement, reported Bloomberg. The second quarter witnessed a sharp reversal from early April’s market turbulence, led by the US trade and geopolitical policy concerns that battered confidence and fuelled recession fears. A strong labour market, healthy consumer spending and hopes for an easing of trade tensions by President Donald Trump pushed major US indices to all-time highs through the end of June. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 10.57 per cent during this period after escaping bear market territory. BlackRock's assets under management rose to $12.53 trillion in the quarter ended June 30, from $10.65 trillion last year. Despite the overall AUM growth, the company’s long-term net inflows fell to $46 billion in the quarter, down by 9.8 per cent. As equities rallied, fixed-income products saw outflows of $4.66 billion, BlackRock told Bloomberg. The company’s total revenue, most of which is earned as a percentage of assets under management, rose to $5.42 billion from $4.81 billion a year ago. The quarter also saw an increased scrutiny of US treasuries. The benchmark 10-year yield recorded one of its biggest weekly increases since 2001 following the "Liberation Day" shock. BlackRock's fixed-income executives expressed concerns about the potential impact of ballooning US debt on appetite for longer-dated treasuries and the dollar, which recorded its worst first-half performance this year since 1973. However, a weaker dollar tends to boost returns from foreign-currency assets, contributing a positive foreign exchange impact of $171.52 billion in the quarter, compared with a $35.45 billion downward revision in the prior year. The "Big Beautiful Bill" recently passed by the Trump administration is projected to add over $3 trillion to the country's $36.2 trillion debt, putting more pressure on treasuries and the dollar. The low-cost investments leader is actively pivoting towards private markets and tech-enabled portfolio solutions to offset slowing growth in exchange-traded funds caused by intense competition and fee compression as the market matures. Private markets saw inflows of $6.82 billion in the quarter. The New York-based firm aims for its private markets and technology businesses to account for 30 per cent or more of its total revenue by 2030, up from 15 per cent in 2024. As part of this push, BlackRock last month announced plans to include private assets in its retirement plans, a segment that manages over half of the company’s total money. This move mirrors similar initiatives taken by its peer, State Street, which also launched a similar offering along with alternative asset manager Apollo in April, the news agency reported. Technology services revenue rose 26.3 per cent to $499 million, reflecting the first full quarter of data provider Preqin, which BlackRock bought in a $3.2 billion deal last year. The deal closed on March 3, 2025. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint. Download The Mint News App to get Daily Market Updates.

Title: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warns of ‘significant risks’ to US economy over Trump trade policies

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon hit back at allies of President Trump on Tuesday, warning that the independence of the Federal Reserve is “absolutely critical” amid a move by GOP bigwigs to force under-fire Chair Jerome Powell to resign. The 72-year-old has been under pressure since The Post revealed that Fed bureaucrats were pushing ahead with a $2.5 billion revamp of its DC headquarters despiting the central bank’s mounting losses. “The President said he’s not going to try to remove Jay Powell,” Dimon said after the publication of the bank’s second quarterly earnings report. “The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical, and not just for the current Fed chairman, who I respect, but for the next Fed chairman.”“Playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences, absolutely opposite of what you might be hoping for,” he said. President Trump — who has repeatedly labeled Powell as “Too Slow” for failing to cut interest rates — on Thursday appointed three new members to the National Capital Planning Commission, which regulates federal development projects. The shake up at NCPC, which has five voting members, is being seen as yet another move to pile more pressure on the man he nominated as Fed chair in 2018 to step aside. The Fed chair was accused of lying to Congress by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac boss Bill Pulte, who urged Powell to quit over the scandal. Dimon also used JPMorgan’s earnings call to warn that President Trump’s trade policies pose “significant risks” to the US economy — even as the bank announced second quarter profits that were once again boosted by its trading. The Wall Street veteran, at the helm of JPMorgan for nearly two decades, reiterated that the commander-in-chief’s tariff plans could upend growth, while praising the passing of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. “The US economy remained resilient in the quarter. The finalization of tax reform and potential deregulation are positive for the economic outlook,” Dimon said, also pointing to an uptick in the company’s investment banking profits. “However, significant risks persist – including from tariffs and trade uncertainty, worsening geopolitical conditions, high fiscal deficits and elevated asset prices,” he added. America’s biggest lender said its net income fell to $15 billion, down 17% from the same period last year. This was due to a one-off $8 billion gain in 2024 from its stake in credit card provider Visa, the bank said. JPMorgan’s second quarter profits are equal $5.24 a share, compared to the $4.48 a share forecast by analysts at the London Stock Exchange Group. Trading revenue was up by 8% to $8.9 billion, with both equities and fixed income markets businesses seeing jumps. The firm’s investment banking unit was also up 8% to $2.5 billion in the first signs that dealmaking doom and gloom is starting to lift on Wall Street. Chief financial officer Jeremy Barnaum said the bank’s deals pipeline was “robust” and that M&A sentiment was “noticeably more upbeat.” Both divisions performed better than management’s earlier guidance. In May, JPMorgan a mid-teens percentage drop in investment banking fees, while trading revenue was expected to grow by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage. Dimon’s remarks came as a string of rival Wall Street firms unveiled their financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Investors will be scrutinizing how executives see the impact of tariffs and the tax and spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump earlier this month. Citigroup, led by CEO Jane Fraser, reported its second quarter results on Tuesday before the opening bell, reporting net income of $4 billion, up 25% from a year ago. The bank’s net income of $4.02 billion climbed 25% from the same quarter last year, or $1.96 per share. That is significantly higher than estimates by the London Stock Exchange Group of $1.60. The lender said total markets revenue rose by 16% versus the same period a year ago, while equity revenue alone was up 6% year over year. Banking was another bright spot, with revenue up 18% over the second quarter of 2024, even with losses on loan hedges. Charlie-Scharf-led Wells Fargo, which saw a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap lifted last month, cut its full-year guidance for net interest income. The San Francisco-based lender posted $11.7 billion in net interest income — income from lending minus the cost of deposits — for the three months through June. It fell just short of analysts’ estimates of $11.8 billion. That prompted Wells Fargo to lower its full-year NII growth target to little changed from last year Advertisement

Title: Sen. David McCormick on the battle for AI innovation: ‘Pennsylvania is at the center of it’

President Donald Trump and Sen. David McCormick of Pennsylvania will jointly announce roughly $70 billion of energy investments in the state Tuesday as the president travels to Pittsburgh for a conference with dozens of top executives to promote his energy and technology agenda. The Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit will be held at Carnegie Mellon University, and it comes as the state’s political and business leaders are working to forge the city into a hub for robotics, artificial intelligence and energy. Trump has repeatedly pledged U.S. “energy dominance” in the global market, and Pennsylvania — a swing state critical to his wins in 2016 and 2024 — is at the forefront of that agenda, in large part due to its coal industry that the Republican administration has taken several steps to bolster. Neither the White House nor McCormick’s office gave breakdowns of the $70 billion or what the investments entail. McCormick, a Republican first-term senator who is organizing the inaugural event, says the summit is meant to bring together top energy companies and AI leaders, global investors and labor behind Trump’s energy policies and priorities. He says the investments will spur tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania. “Pennsylvania is uniquely positioned because of abundant energy, of incredible skilled workers, technology,” McCormick said in a Fox News interview Monday promoting the summit. “We need to win the battle for AI innovation in America, and Pennsylvania is at the center of it.” The list of participating CEOs includes leaders from global behemoths like Blackstone, SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, BlackRock and ExxonMobil and local companies such as the Pittsburgh-based Gecko Robotics, which deploys AI to bolster energy capacity. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will also attend. Administration officials speaking at the summit include White House crypto czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary Chris Wright. In the Fox News interview, McCormick credited his wife, Dina Powell McCormick, with the idea for a summit. Powell McCormick served as Trump’s deputy national security adviser in his first term and is a former Goldman Sachs executive who is now at BDT & MSD Partners, a merchant bank. Pittsburgh is home to Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious engineering school, plus a growing industry of small robotics firms and a so-called “AI Avenue” that’s home to offices for Google and other AI firms. It also sits in the middle of the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir. Pennsylvania has scored several big investment wins in recent months, some of it driven by federal manufacturing policy and others by the ravenous need for electricity from the fast-growing AI business. Nippon Steel just bought U.S. Steel for almost $15 billion, getting Trump’s approval after pledging to invest billions alone in U.S. Steel’s Pittsburgh-area plants. Amazon will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, with more to come, while a one-time coal-fired power plant is being turned into the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant to fuel a data center campus. Meanwhile, Microsoft says it is spending $1.6 billion to reopen the lone functional nuclear reactor on Three Mile Island under a long-term power supply agreement for its data centers. Shapiro, elected in 2022, has been pushing for the state to land a big multibillion-dollar industrial project, like a semiconductor factory or an electric vehicle plant. In his first budget speech, Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender in 2028 — told lawmakers that Pennsylvania needs to “get in the game” and warned that it would take money. He didn’t land a mega project, but he instead has worked to play up big investments by Amazon and Microsoft, as well as Nippon Steel, as he prepares to seek a second term. ___ Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
