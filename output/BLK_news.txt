Title: Bitcoin’s 2025 review: The “violent transformation” hidden behind the year’s deceptively flat price chart

Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered a brutal lesson in market structure for Bitcoin. The year began with political momentum and drifted into a summer of aggressive policy signals. Yet, it snapped into one of the sharpest boom-to-bust sequences in the asset’s history. By December, the price had round-tripped, leaving the asset flat for the year. But the flat chart masked a violent transformation underneath. While Wall Street banks finally opened their doors and ETFs vacuumed up record capital, the network’s physical infrastructure faced a solvency crisis. CryptoSlate has compiled some of the major trends that defined the market in 2025 below: President Trump moved from election promises to execution. On March 6, the White House signed Executive Order 14233, formally establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The US considers untapped financial resources, like tariff revenues and gold revaluation, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The order consolidated forfeited federal bitcoin holdings into a dedicated US Digital Asset Stockpile, ending the era of sporadic auctions by the US Marshals. A week later, lawmakers introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025 to codify this framework. This legislation transformed the US government from a net seller into a strategic holder, signaling to global sovereigns that Bitcoin is a recognized reserve asset. Following this lead, states like Texas and Pennsylvania launched similar initiatives. Internationally, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland began exploring sovereign accumulation. In the corporate sector, the “Bitcoin Treasury” trend accelerated. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and over 100 other public companies now hold more than 1 million BTC on their balance sheets, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sam Callahan, the director of Strategy and Research at Oranje BTC, explained that these entities embraced BTC because it “is a superior reserve asset to gold.” According to him: “Bitcoin is digital. Bitcoin is fully auditable in real time, and can be transferred instantly. Bitcoin has an absolute fixed supply. Gold’s supply will continue to expand, forever, from ongoing mining.” Another major milestone that defined the year was the traditional financial regulatory environment that shifted to accommodate Bitcoin. Over the past year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its sister financial organizations, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have made significant regulatory progress that has enshrined Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. For context, the CFTC approved Bitcoin as a valid margin in regulated derivatives markets, and the US Federal Housing also recognized the top crypto as an asset for mortgage qualification in the United States. However, the most significant changes came from the banking regulators, which fully embraced Bitcoin. FSOC dropped Bitcoin from its vulnerabilities list in 2025, coordinating with the GENIUS Act and OCC bank charters to normalize institutional access. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Interpretative Letter 1188. This document clarified that national banks can execute “riskless principal” crypto transactions. Previously, banks hesitated to broker trades because they did not want to hold volatile assets on their balance sheets. A “riskless principal” trade solves this. It allows a bank to buy an asset from a seller and resell it to a buyer immediately. The bank facilitates liquidity but never holds market risk. This letter, combined with conditional charter approvals for firms like BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Ripple National Trust Bank, effectively integrated crypto into the US banking stack. Due to these regulatory milestones, banks that hitherto treated Bitcoin as a reputational risk have changed their stance. In 2025, they began fighting for market share. Notably, CryptoSlate previously reported that 60% of the top 25 US banks now pursue strategies to sell, safeguard, or advise on Bitcoin. This shows that major financial institutions like PNC Bank, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and others opened their operations to enable Bitcoin trading and custody for interested clients. PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Considering this level of growth, Bitcoin analyst Joe Consorti argued that BTC had become “too big for Wall Street to ignore.” Away from the banks embrace of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market also provided strong performance for industry players this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the ETF landscape. This year, IBIT has attracted over $25 billion in inflows, ranking it sixth among all US ETFs. Crucially, investors used Bitcoin differently from gold. While the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw inflows as gold hit record highs, Bitcoin ETF inflows persisted even as BTC's price stagnated. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's ETF analyst, said: “IBIT is the only ETF on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard with a negative return for the year…That's a really good sign long term IMO. If you can do $25 billion in bad year imagine the flow potential in good year.” Indeed, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, had described BTC as one of this “year’s biggest investment themes.” Considering this, market analysts explained that investors treated Bitcoin as a structural accumulation play rather than a momentum trade. Bitcoin's evolution reflects in off-chain ETF growth and reduced on-chain activity despite decentralized roots. Meanwhile, other positive developments within the ETF complex saw the US SEC approve “in-kind” creations and redemptions for spot ETFs. This technical change enabled Authorized Participants (APs) to swap actual BTC for ETF shares, rather than first converting to cash. At the same time, the financial regulator also allowed options on IBIT to go live. This provided hedgers and basis traders with the necessary tools to manage risk, completing the institutional derivatives stack. Unsurprisignly, BTC's price action followed its own volatile script. In early October, Bitcoin broke resistance to set a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. While the government and ETFs bought, long-term holders sold. On-chain data showed that wallets holding Bitcoin for 155 days or more contributed heavily to the October rally. This distribution, combined with macro-deleveraging, drove prices back under $90,000, which represented an over 30% correction. Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions complicated the picture. The US economy has seen significant Federal Reserve rates cut this year, with some arging that these moves were a positive for BTC price performance. However, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) simultaneously inched rates higher, tightening global liquidity and squeezing speculative carry trades. Japan's monetary shift scrutinizes yen's role in crypto trades, hinting at broader market challenges. Still, despite this market conditions, Bitcoin advocates believe the top crypto would shine. Pierre Rochard, the CEO of the Bitcoin Bond Company, said: “Bitcoin can be understood as a global “savings reservoir” for excess capital: when interest rates are low, liquidity is abundant, and high expected ROIC real investments are scarce, savings migrate into Bitcoin because it is a finite scarcity, a global digital open source network with a fixed 21 million supply.” While Wall Street integrated Bitcoin, the miners securing the network faced a crisis. Following the October peak, BTC's hashrate collapsed from a peak of 1.3 zetahash per second (zh/s) to 852 EH/S recently. It has recovered to 1.09 zh/s as fof press time. Hashrate is the lifeblood of Bitcoin security, which is used to drive the network trust. The higher the hashrate, the harder it is for any attacker to rewrite Bitcoin’s ledger. So, as BTC's price corrected below $90,000, older machines became a liability to Bitcoin miners. This is because the total cost to produce 1 BTC (including depreciation) for the average listed miner hovers near $137,800. With spot prices trading at a $47,000 discount to production cost, margins evaporated. To survive, miners pivoted to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Seven of the top ten miners now report revenue from AI contracts. Ranking the top Bitcoin miners by AI revenue and hashrate reveals how the industry’s leaders are redefining scale. Google emerged as a key financier in this shift. Rather than acquiring mining firms outright, Google provided credit support to help miners upgrade their infrastructure for AI workloads. This transition signals a permanent change in the industry: miners are evolving into hybrid energy-compute centers to hedge against Bitcoin volatility. Despite all of the institutional progress and positives of the past year, the psychological fears remained. 2025 was the year of integration. The “plumbing” is no longer theoretical. ETFs now function with in-kind efficiency, banks possess the regulatory clearance to trade, and the U.S. government formally holds the asset. However, the miner insolvency crisis and the LTH sell-off proved that structural adoption does not guarantee “up only” price action.

Title: Exclusive: Nvidia buying AI chip startup Groq’s assets for about $20 billion in largest deal on record

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2025 10:01:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup’s latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: Rich like Bill Gates: Meet the Saudi sisters wielding $75 billion in a man’s world

When President Donald Trump feted Saudi Arabia’s crown prince at a state dinner last month, invitees included heavyweights like Apple boss Tim Cook and Citigroup’s Jane Fraser. Seated next to Elon Musk was Lubna Olayan, whose deep connections to both Wall Street and the kingdom marked her out as one of the most influential people in a room packed with luminaries. That White House banquet underscored the growing influence of the Olayan Group, a sprawling and secretive Saudi empire that Lubna and her sister Hutham have helmed for decades. The duo came of age at a time when women weren’t permitted to drive and needed a male guardian’s permission to even get a passport in the kingdom. Yet they’ve managed to steer the family conglomerate into a behemoth that operates at the scale of a sovereign wealth fund. Described as frank and outgoing, Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan has a reputation for being deeply involved with her family’s investments.Credit: Bloomberg The group controls a nearly $US13 billion ($19.6 billion) stock portfolio in the US, with stakes worth almost $US1 billion in BlackRock and $US1.5 billion in JPMorgan Chase, filings show. A large investor in Credit Suisse before its collapse, the conglomerate boasts a prime property portfolio that spans from Madison Avenue to central London. It has forged a large Dubai real-estate deal with Brookfield, and makes vast investments in private equity and fixed income. At home, it bottles Coca-Cola, runs Burger King outlets and services oilfields. Those bets have transformed the Olayan clan into one of the world’s richest families. Their fortune is valued at more than $US50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is including them in its annual list for the first time. That figure doesn’t fully reflect the magnitude of their riches, according to people familiar with the matter, as the group discloses limited financial information. Many of them pegged the Olayans’ net worth well above $US100 billion, putting them in the same league as Bill Gates, Carlos Slim and Mukesh Ambani. ‘Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy. We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.’ That makes the Olayans richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett. Their influence extends well beyond that financial firepower, aided in part by a loyalty to Saudi Arabia during tough times that’s made the group an indispensable national fixture, people familiar with the matter said. The extent of the Olayans’ reach often has Wall Street bosses reaching out for advice as they race to expand in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s nearly $US1.3 trillion economy. “MBS continues to be drawn to the US as preferred partner in security and economic development,” said Steffen Hertog, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “Having private interlocutors with close links to US finance is useful.” A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn’t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family’s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn’t public. Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile. His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman’s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family’s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles — Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women’s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce — all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation. “So, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government’s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna’s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that’s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett.Credit: AP “The family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,” said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University. In one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom’s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. “Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy,” Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. “We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.” Even so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group’s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender’s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans’ profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy. Despite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom’s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi’s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. This year, during Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canapés and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia’s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks. The group’s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm’s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom’s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco’s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS — as the de facto ruler is called — to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. “You negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she says.Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom’s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. “We are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,” Lubna said in her address. These days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group’s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders’ board, the group’s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she’s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. “If you talk with her about current events, it’s not just, ‘This happened.’ She understands why things are moving the way they are.” Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive. The sisters are among the few people who understand the true extent of their sprawling business in its entirety, and tightly control its financial details. There have been moments in past years when a listing of an operating business seemed imminent, but deals haven’t materialised. Meanwhile, much has changed for Saudi women in the workforce. In the past seven years, the kingdom has announced reforms allowing women to set up businesses without male consent and travel independently, and many now run private equity funds, trade stocks and work in factories. “We look for opportunities, even in adversity,” said Hutham in her 2013 speech about her family. “We see silver linings.” Bloomberg The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Title: The top 12 crypto winners of 2025: who got it right this year?

Why Solana, Zcash, and the Trump Administration defined 2025, and what their dominance means for 2026. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If 2024 was the year of the crypto reawakening, 2025 was the year the plumbing finally got permitted. This year, the emerging industry entered January with tentative optimism and exited December with federal statutes. As a result, the narrative shifted definitively from “crypto as a casino” to “crypto as capital markets infrastructure.” During this period, volumes moved on-chain, policy moved into the White House, and major asset managers moved past their hesitation, as evidenced most starkly by Vanguard’s reversal earlier this month, which allowed crypto ETFs on its platform. However, in a year defined by record-breaking flows and legislative victories, not everyone shared the spoils equally. The winners of 2025 weren’t just the assets that went up; they were the protocols, people, and products that fundamentally secured their place in the future of finance. Based on CryptoSlate's analysis, here are the 12 definitive winners of the year and why they mattered: There is no discussion of the crypto landscape in 2025 without acknowledging the sheer force of the US pivot. For years, the industry operated with one foot out the door, eyeing Dubai or Singapore. In 2025, the US slammed that door shut and locked everyone inside—happily. Considering this, the victory is shared between the jurisdiction itself and the catalyst at the top. The 47th President’s administration delivered on the industry's longest-held wish list in under 12 months, effectively re-onshoring the digital asset economy. Several Executive Orders backing digital assets set the tone, but the strategic victories were tactical. The signing of the GENIUS Act on July 18 provided the first federal definition for stablecoins, while the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” Executive Order in March signaled to sovereign wealth funds globally that digital assets were a matter of national security. Crucially, by pushing a leadership change at the SEC and the CFTC, the administration cleared the “regulation by enforcement” fog. Essentially, Trump's actions have set the tone to make the US “the crypto capital of the world.” The premier vehicle for institutional access didn't just survive its sophomore year; it thrived despite BTC's poor performance. This was evidenced by BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerging as one of the top 10 US ETFs by inflows, outpacing traditional heavyweights such as the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Away from the flagship digital asset, Ethereum spot ETFs cemented their status as the default on-ramp for wealth managers, rendering the “not your keys, not your coins” debate irrelevant for the suit-and-tie crowd. The pivotal moment came in September when the SEC approved **generic listing standards**. This technical but crucial policy win slashed the red tape for future products, removing the need for 19b-4 filings for every single new ticker. As a result, the market welcomed an avalanche of new products focused on other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, which also delivered strong performance this year. Solana effectively shed its “beta” reputation in 2025, as the “fast but breaks” narrative is dead. At the same time, Solana pulled off the most difficult pivot in crypto this year by going from the “memecoin casino” to the “liquidity layer” of the global market. While it maintained its cultural dominance, CoinGecko reported that Solana was the most-followed blockchain ecosystem globally in 2025 for the second consecutive year. The network is no longer just about speculative tokens; it is now where efficient capital lives. According to Artemis data, Solana has emerged as a fundamental liquidity layer, with on-chain SOL-USD trading volume exceeding the combined SOL spot volume on Binance and Bybit, two of the top three centralized exchanges by trading volume, for three consecutive months. Essentially, Solana has differentiated itself as the primary venue for execution-sensitive activity. It is no longer just competing with Ethereum; it is competing with Nasdaq. If Solana won on speed, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, won on distribution. By leveraging the US-based exchange's massive existing user base, Base became the sticky default for consumer apps and stablecoin experimentation. Base proved that in 2025, distribution matters more than novel cryptography. It became the launchpad for “normie” crypto—consumer fintech apps that use crypto rails on the backend without the user ever knowing. It is the bridge between the chaotic on-chain world and the regulated safety of Coinbase. After years of legal purgatory, 2025 was the year Ripple and XRP were finally set free. The long-running battle between the firm and the SEC officially concluded with a final judgment that cleared the runway for institutional adoption. As a result, XRP's narrative shifted overnight from “litigation risk” to “liquidity engine,” driving its value upward and paving the way for the launch of the first Spot XRP ETFs in November. At the same time, the company behind it, Ripple, spent the year aggressively buying the plumbing of traditional finance. Ripple deployed over $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this year alone, most notably the purchase of prime broker Hidden Road, treasury management firm GTreasury, and stablecoin infrastructure provider Rail. These moves have effectively transformed Ripple from a “payments company” into a full-stack institutional powerhouse. The surprise comeback of the year was Zcash and the privacy sector as a whole. Emerging as the undisputed best-performing sector of 2025, privacy coins shed their “illicit” stigma to become the darlings of the post-surveillance economy. While Zcash led the charge, the momentum was sector-wide. Ethereum developers accelerated their privacy initiatives, while other privacy solutions finally gained mainnet traction. Moreover, the regulatory thaw was palpable as the SEC held formal meetings with privacy protocol leaders to discuss compliant architecture. Notably, that would have been unthinkable a year ago. Real World Assets (RWAs) moved from “pilot programs” to “critical plumbing,” heavily aided by a friendly SEC. The Commission’s shift away from hostile enforcement allowed major players to integrate these assets without fear of a Wells Notice. The watershed moment was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund being accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance. This blurred the lines between TradFi and the crypto market structure. By December, tokenized money market funds and T-bills had surpassed $8 billion in AUM, while the broader RWA market is around $20 billion. Moreover, traditional financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) are heavily banking on the sector to make the traditional financial sector more transparent and efficient. Like Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair, said: “On-chain markets will bring greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency for investors.” The “killer app” debate is over. Stablecoins are the rail. The sector's market cap breached $300 billion in October, while Ethereum-based stablecoin supply hit an all-time high of $166 billion in September. In fact, Token Terminal stated that the total number of stablecoin holders is at an all-time high of around 200 million. This shows that the sector's growth was driven by these assets' ability to settle instantly, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, legislative progress in the US, especially the passage of the GENIUS Act, provided the legal clarity for banks to enter the fray. Essentially, stablecoins are no longer just trading chips; they are becoming the settlement layer for global fintech. Jeremy NG, the founder of Open Eden, captured it best, saying: “Stablecoins have crossed the line from crypto plumbing to financial infrastructure.” On-chain derivatives crossed the credibility chasm as monthly volumes hit a record $1.2 trillion in October. This sector won because it successfully siphoned volume from centralized exchanges (CEXs) by offering self-custody and, frankly, better incentives. The rise of perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster signals a maturity in DeFi market structure. Traders are increasingly comfortable leaving billions in smart contract risk to avoid counterparty risk. 2025 was the year event contracts entered the US mainstream as Kalshi and Polymarket, the two dominant platforms in the sector, printed record numbers this year. However, the headline winner is that several traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms like Gemini and Coinbase have also thrown their hats into the nascent sector. This sector won because it bridged the gap between “gambling” and “finance.” With Polymarket also receiving a path forward via an amended CFTC framework, event contracts are moving from niche internet curiosities to regulated hedging instruments. While the US focused on legislation, Hong Kong focused on execution supremacy—and the data proves it. In Q3 2025, Hong Kong's ETP market officially overtook South Korea and Japan to become the third largest globally by turnover, with average daily turnover hitting HK$37.8 billion (+150% YoY). The city's strategy of regulatory clarity paid off in tangible exchange milestones. The VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) regime matured from a “deemed-to-be-licensed” purgatory into a robust ecosystem. By mid-2025, the SFC granted full licenses to additional major global exchanges, bringing the total number of licensed exchanges to 11. This effectively funneled regional institutional liquidity into a compliant, bank-connected net, isolating unregulated players. At the same time, the city's Stablecoins Ordinance that came into force on Aug. 1, created a pristine sandbox that attracted over 30 applicants by the September deadline. The final spot on this list belongs to you—the cohort that stayed. Over the past grueling years, early believers were told that crypto was a fraud, a bubble, or a dead end. They endured the collapse of 2022, the regulatory chokehold of the Gensler years, and the boredom of 2024. In 2025, they were vindicated. This year wasn't just about “numbers go up”; it was about “thesis proved right.” As a result, the early believers successfully front-ran the most prominent institutions on earth. When BlackRock, Vanguard, and Sovereign Wealth Funds finally entered the arena in force this year, they were buying bags from individuals who had high-conviction foresight when the outlook was bleakest. The 2026 Outlook: As this cohort realizes generational wealth, they are not exiting the ecosystem—they are becoming its bankers.

Title: How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: BlackRock strategists expect limited rate cuts in 2026 unless labor market cracks

Time Published: 2025-12-24T15:11:11Z

Share this article The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver limited rate cuts in 2026 unless there is a sharp deterioration in the labor market, according to BlackRock senior strategists Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly. Their outlook reflects recent US labor market data, which point to modest softening but no sharp downturn. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest since 2021, analysts noted that part of the increase was driven by higher labor force participation and government job losses rather than a fundamental weakening in labor conditions. From a policy standpoint, the Fed continues to view labor risks as balanced, according to BlackRock’s strategists. Recent data echo some downside concerns flagged by Chair Jerome Powell, but do not signal a major breakdown in employment conditions, they stated. With 175 basis points of cuts already implemented since September 2024 and policy rates approaching neutral, BlackRock sees limited room for aggressive easing in 2026. Further cuts would depend on a sharp labor market decline, which they do not expect. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Expedia CEO Ariane Gorin on the fight to ensure AI doesn’t turn her brands into invisible pipes consumers never see

Good morning. The holidays feel like a good time to check in with Ariane Gorin, CEO of Expedia Group. 2025 has been a banner year for travel and for Expedia, which saw its revenues rise 7.6% to $13.4 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with its stock up more than 50% so far this year. In the latest episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next, Gorin spoke to me and Kristin Stoller about the evolving travel landscape and how she’s leading in this tricky climate. AI is reshaping the travel experience as many of us turn to large language models to plan and even pay for trips. That presents both an opportunity and a potential threat for leaders like Gorin—and Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel, with whom we spoke earlier this year. The opportunity: to deploy AI internally and forge partnerships that embed the group’s Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo functionality within the LLMs. The risk: hallucinations, privacy violations, and the specter of LLMs reducing the need for travel sites or turning them into invisible pipes that consumers never see. “We’ve been working for years with Google and Bing … and now it’s about deepening our partnerships,” said Gorin, adding that AI has enabled innovation like Expedia’s new trip-matching feature that turns Instagram reels into bookable travel experiences. “It’s been quite fun to challenge ourselves to say, ‘how do we make sure that our brands are showing up well there?’” Gorin also talks about building up Brand USA among foreigners during this delicate time when former stalwarts (hello, Canada!) may be staying away and events from the World Cup to America’s 250th anniversary are expected to boost tourism. Her approach is to start with telling the story that Americans are “making it welcoming, that we’re making the infrastructure welcoming, we’re making it easy to come to the country.” That’s a message many leaders would love to rally around. You can listen to our conversation on Apple or Spotify. Also, the CEO Daily team is taking a break for the holidays. See you back here on January 5. As always, we welcome your thoughts and appreciate you reading what we write.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S. sends more troops to the Caribbean Large numbers of ships, special-operations aircraft, troops, and equipment are being amassed by the U.S. military in the Caribbean in a buildup to a potential attack on Venezuela, which may include airstrikes on Venezuelan soil. “We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we’ve ever had, and by far the biggest we’ve ever had in South America,” President Trump said. “Soon we will be starting the same program on land.” Trump wants to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro out of office. Trump flew on Epstein’s plane more often than thought The U.S. Justice Department released thousands more documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, and many made mention of President Donald Trump. None of them describe wrongdoing. But one email, from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said flight records showed Trump used Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).” There are 700,000 more pages of Epstein material on the way—so expect the headlines on this issue to last another week. Epstein sought Wall Street giants as executors of his will The Epstein documents show that the late financier hoped that high-powered Wall Street execs would be the executors of his estate. He named Jimmy Cayne, the former CEO of Bear Stearns; Jes Staley, formerly of JPMorgan and an ex-CEO of Barclays, Goldman Sachs legal chief Kathryn Ruemmler, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as executors in various versions of his will. It is not clear that any of them knew they were named by Epstein. Big Tech companies have $120 billion in off-balance sheet debt Meta, xAI, Oracle, CoreWeave and others have moved $120 billion in spending on AI data centers off their balance sheets and into special-purpose vehicles or private credit entities funded by Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, Blue Owl Capital , JPMorgan, and others, according to a Financial Times analysis. U.S. GDP fueled mostly by AI U.S. GDP grew 4.3% in Q3, far surpassing expectations, but most of that growth comes from one thing: AI data centers. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that private fixed investment—a measure of how much companies are spending—“is rising only due to AI-related spending.” All other private fixed investment is actually in decline. Deutsche Bank said, “Investment in AI-related sectors is critical to GDP growth [and the] U.S. would be close to recession this year if it weren’t for tech-related spending.” Trump Administration bans former EU commissioner from entering the U.S. Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner who backed the Digital Services Act, and four anti-disinformation campaigners have been banned from entering the U.S. “The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. The DSA bans U.S. tech platforms from targeting users with data based on gender, race, religion, or age. Targeting children with ads will also be prohibited. It also requires platforms to take down content that incites terrorism or child sexual abuse. Progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks Ukraine’s President Zelensky is hopeful he can persuade the U.S. to support a proposal that would halt Russia’s war along the current contact lines. Russia has suggested it could pull back troops from some areas, Zelensky said, but Ukraine is reluctant to cede territory it controls. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning. The last session closed up 0.46% to hit a new record of 6,909.79. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.39% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.12% in early trading.

Title: Crypto Won In 2025—But Bitcoin Fell. Can They Rise to the Occasion?

The rise and subsequent retreat of bitcoin perfectly encapsulates the crypto industry's year. It won big—but it doesn't have much to show for it yet. The price of bitcoin, the world's most well-known cryptocurrency, soared above $126,000, a record, but those gains evaporated and it's poised to finish down for 2025. The industry welcomed the passage of stablecoin legislation, eased regulation, and the proliferation of new ways to buy in, but by many measures it has yet to reap the benefits. Despite all this, plenty of reasons for optimism regarding the both sector and the currencies themselves remain. Next year could be when the effects of institutional buy-in and regulatory shift will start to show, crypto watchers say. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) could break out of its rut to book new highs, experts say, while altcoins could get a regulatory boost. And interest in "tokens"—the digital representation of assets like the dollar or stocks—could take off, further extending the investing world into digital space. "If you talk to retail crypto, the vibe is extraordinarily negative. They look at their world, which extends out a few weeks in time, and see dark clouds—and so they're selling," Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management told Investopedia. "And then if you talk to institutional investors, they're just unremittingly bullish." The crypto industry has said that regulation was holding back its potential and that it would upend and replace the existing financial system. Now that a crypto-friendly administration has paved the way, investors are waiting for some of those promised developments to be realized. Bitcoin's supporters see reasons for optimism in the broader outlook for markets in 2026. The prospect of lower interest rates is generally beneficial to risk assets and could both fuel retail appetite for and institutional investor interest in crypto. The coming wave of capital implied by major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch offering access to crypto ETFs to their clients, and big university endowments like those of Harvard and Brown buying in, could also lift bitcoin next year, Hougan said. He expects institutional demand to outpace new supply in the years to come. Since crypto ETFs launched in 2024, they have bought more than 700,000 bitcoin, roughly twice the number of new coins produced by the Bitcoin network over the same period, according to a Bitwise report. The so-called debasement trade—in which investors seek hedges, such as crypto or other assets, against high government debt and a declining dollar—may also come back into play, drawing investor interest next year. "For individuals investing against or hedging their debasement risk, bitcoin makes a lot of sense," Amberdata's director of derivatives Greg Magadini said. Bitcoin's permabulls broadly expect prices to continue to go higher—if not next year, then by the end of the decade. Standard Chartered, for example, sees it hitting $500,000 by 2030. The nearer term outlook for the cryptocurrency, however, is muddier. Galaxy Digital, a financial services firm focused on digital assets, in its 2026 outlook said bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of 2027 but called next year "too chaotic to predict." (That generally tracks with the outlooks of some stock-focused analysts, who think the S&P could rise next year but perhaps not smoothly.) Enthusiasm for crypto has led related businesses to stock exchanges amid a revival in initial public offerings. Their collective performance was mixed: Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) hit it big and retained some of its early-won gains, as did Bullish (BLSH). But shares of Winklevoss twins-founded crypto platform Gemini (GEMI) have fallen substantially below their IPO price. (A few well-known firms are eyeing a debut next year.) Strategy (MSTR), the software company that put itself on the map by stockpiling bitcoin, tumbled more than 45% year-to-date. The passage of the CLARITY Act, which provides a framework for regulating crypto in the same way the GENIUS Act did for stablecoins, could also support crypto. David Sacks, the White House's adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence, has said "we are closer than ever" to passing the bill. If the bill is signed into law, the outlook for crypto would improve, Hougan said, because it would enshrine the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, as crypto's oversight agency, considered the industry's preferred outcome. If it doesn't, a less crypto-friendly future administration might take a different approach. The CLARITY Act would set a more solid regulatory foundation for the industry to operate, according to Hougan, and potentially invigorate demand for altcoins like ether and sol. "It's the biggest risk to crypto right now," he said. "People are pricing in a higher probability that market structure legislation won't get passed." Tokens tied to real-world assets, like stablecoins or ones linked to stocks, could also fire up interest in crypto next year, with some crypto experts saying they can can improve the functioning of the financial system. Circle in 2025 saw its USDC stablecoin expand its reach, with its circulating supply jumping more than 50%, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently predicted that tokenization could transform the financial market sooner rather than later. "It's the way the world will be...maybe not even in 10 years, maybe even a lot less time, maybe a couple of years from now," Atkins told Fox Business. The tokenization of stocks, an opportunity potentially measured in the trillions of dollars, is being tackled by crypto players and at least one of the financial industry's juggernauts. Coinbase Global (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, which recently unveiled its own token platform (as well as stock trading), and BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, have both made tokenization a strategic priority.

Title: ‘If I can help someone, I will’: the Dublin woman who has been providing Christmas dinners for 39 years

“I won’t be here forever and these people cannot be left without,” said Dubliner Margaret Brown, who has been providing Christmas dinners to those in need and the homeless for almost four decades. Mrs Brown, from Sandycove in south Co Dublin, has been organising the festive feast since 1986 after she and her late mother saw people in a scout hall eating lumpy soup and cold meat while huddled around a gas-fired heater. “Running out of turkey 39 years ago when I first started cooking dinners with my mother, I never thought I would be doing this all these years later,” she said. “But thankfully I can still do this; for how much longer I do not know.” Mrs Brown, who is in her 80s, originally organised her annual Christmas dinners in Blackrock Rugby Club in south Dublin. In the past, high-profile names such as rock band U2 have surprised guests at the annual Christmas dinner when people gathered at the rugby club. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and forced Mrs Brown and scores of volunteers to turn to making takeout meals instead. Now the new tradition of delivering the five-course feast of a full Christmas dinner, with pudding and mince pies, is here to stay. “I won’t be here forever, but I’ll keep making the dinners with the help of so many wonderful volunteers thanks to donations we receive from food producers,” said Mrs Brown. The numbers she is feeding have surpassed 200, which is normally the cut-off number she and her team can cook for. “The numbers we could provide for filled our list way in advance of the cut-off date,” she said. “There are so many new people, many of whom are younger, not just older individuals who are lonely and homeless, which is shocking.” The 39 years she has been feeding people has passed “in the blink of an eye” and the needs of people have changed in that time. “There have been a lot of changes in social needs over those years and food provisions have to meet those demands,” she said. The team of volunteers will be cooking for 60 people living in Bethany House for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire. There will also be a special meal for Travellers living in Carrickmines who lost several family members in a blaze 10 years ago. [ ‘So long as these people are here, we’ll never starve’: In the queue for Christmas vouchers at Dublin’s Capuchin Day CentreOpens in new window ] “It takes a lot of preparation in the lead-up to Christmas Day, receiving donations, streamlining of cooking times, delivering the food to people, or them calling to the rugby club at specific times and ensuring no one is forgotten,” said Mrs Brown. Her giving has not just been at Christmas. In 2019 she helped repatriate the remains of an Irishman, Joseph Tuohy from Toomevara, Co Tipperary, as he had no known relatives still alive, and helped prepare a funeral for him. Mr Tuohy, who died in his late 80s, was separated from his mother at age five and spent his childhood in orphanages and St Joseph’s Industrial School in Clonmel. He emigrated to London in his late teens and never returned to Ireland, losing contact with his family. He experienced periods of homelessness and illness in London. Mrs Brown was contacted about his case in her capacity as a volunteer for the Friends of the Forgotten Irish Emigrants, who launched an appeal to Mr Tuohy’s relatives and for people to attend his funeral. His ashes were subsequently laid in consecrated ground in Tipperary. “I didn’t set out for my life to be like this, or to become known for trying to help others, but life can be so difficult for so many and if I can help someone I will,” said Mrs Brown.

Title: Extended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode

Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have recorded sustained outflows since early November, which Glassnode says signals institutional disengagement. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode. Since early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday. “This persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market,” it added. Flows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October. The ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted. Coinglass said aggregate Bitcoin ETF flows have been in the red for the past four consecutive trading days. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen minor inflows over the past week. “Crypto ETF selling pressure is back,” the Kobeissi Letter said on Tuesday. It reported that crypto funds recorded $952 million in outflows last week, and investors have now withdrawn capital in six out of the last ten weeks. Related: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks Despite the recent outflows, the industry-dominant BlackRock fund has seen $62.5 billion in inflows since inception, eclipsing all rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Saturday that IBIT is the only ETF on Bloomberg’s “2025 Flow Leaderboard” with a negative return for the year. “The real takeaway is that it was sixth place despite the negative return,” he added. Balchunas said that BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin fund even took in more than the SPDR Gold Shares fund (GLD), which was up 64%.

Title: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Two new exchange-traded funds from Amplify track companies building the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenization, blending stocks and crypto. Cointelegraph in your social feed Digital asset manager Amplify has launched two exchange-traded funds tracking blockchain projects across stablecoins and tokenization. The company said on Tuesday that its Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) both went live on the NYSE Arca exchange. Both funds track a diversified index of companies working on products or infrastructure, along with projects that generate revenue from tokenization and stablecoins. “These new ETFs expand Amplify’s lineup at a time when the infrastructure behind stablecoins and the growth of tokenization are shaping the next phase of digital finance,” the company said. Stablecoins and tokenization have been among the most popular themes in crypto this year, with the US passing laws that have given institutions confidence to launch stablecoins, and regulators opening dialogue on how they should treat assets such as tokenized stocks. Amplify said its stablecoin-focused ETF tracks shares of companies “generating significant revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms.” It holds shares in companies working on stablecoins such as Visa, Circle, Mastercard and PayPal, alongside crypto ETFs from Grayscale, iShares and Bitwise. The firm pointed to regulatory developments in the US and EU, noting that the “GENIUS Act in the US and MiCA in Europe are positioning stablecoins as the compliant backbone of digital finance.” Related: Clarity Act delays led to $952M in crypto fund outflows: CoinShares Meanwhile, the tokenization fund includes exposure to BlackRock, JPMorgan, Figure Technology Solution, Citigroup and the Nasdaq, which all have made tokenization plays over the past few years as they seek opportunities to digitize traditional financial services.

JPMorgan is making another big bet on crypto. The Wall Street giant is considering letting institutional clients trade cryptocurrency, according to reporting on Monday from Bloomberg. These products and services may reportedly include spot and derivatives trading, and the efforts are still in their early stages. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The move comes amid the company’s broader embrace of digital assets. In October, the bank announced that it would allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral. And earlier in December, JPMorgan’s asset management arm launched its first tokenized money fund. The bank’s recent expansion of crypto is notable given how CEO Jamie Dimon has long expressed contempt for the sector. As recently as last year, Dimon compared Bitcoin to a “pet rock”, and said that its only uses were for money laundering and fraud, among other illegal activities. The remarks followed other insults Dimon has heaped on crypto over the years. JPMorgan’s pivot towards crypto follows President Donald Trump’s more favorable policies toward the sector. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation was enacted as Trump’s family profited from the industry. Given the new regulatory landscape for crypto, other major financial companies have also been hopping on the bandwagon. BlackRock manages close to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $11 billion in Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, fellow financial giant Fidelity is involved in crypto staking, while Goldman Sachs has a private blockchain that is testing tokenized fund redemptions. And UBS, Citi, and HSBC have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and crypto custody services. Wall Street’s latest digital asset adoption has not, however, translated to big price wins for the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down about 30% to roughly $87,000 since its high of $126,000 in early October. Ethereum is also down roughly 30% in the last three months to $2,919, and Solana is down roughly 43% to $123.07 during that same time period. It appears that the big banks are taking a long-term view on crypto and are not being scared off by this recent dip.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Executive John Ameriks emphasized Vanguard’s core view of the crypto sector hasn’t changed, seeing the asset class as highly speculative. Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant’s begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) broke its 2021 all-time high in August, brushing $4,945 and a $600 billion market cap, while exchange balances hit record lows. Corporate treasuries and spot ETFs now control nearly 11% of the circulating supply. By every structural metric, ETH should feel like it's having a moment. It doesn't. No Bored Apes are selling for seven figures. No TikTok explainers are going viral. The 2025 ETH rally is real, measurable, and entirely clinical. This is a quiet reallocation by institutions treating Ethereum less like a speculative trade and more like yield-bearing infrastructure. The cultural void raises a sharper question: is ETH transitioning from layer-1 casino to institutional plumbing, and what does price discovery look like when the buyers don't care about hype? The supply story is unambiguous. Only 10.5% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges as of Dec. 21, one of the lowest shares since the network launched and down 43% since July, per Coinglass data. Additionally, more than 35.6 million ETH is locked in staking as of Dec. 20. BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. This isn't speculative hoarding, but rather an operational infrastructure. Nansen's holder composition shows the largest addresses are staking contracts, institutional custodians, and ETF wrappers, not whale wallets. Exchange float is draining, but not into day-trading accounts. It's moving into pipes: layer-2 bridges, restaking protocols, treasury vaults. Corporate balance sheets tell the same story. Treasury data from Dec. 19 estimates that corporate holders plus spot Ethereum ETFs now control 10.72% of the circulating supply. This is divided in 5.63% in corporate hands and 5.09% in ETFs, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. BitMine has accumulated over 4 million ETH, equivalent to 3.36% of the total supply, and has explicit plans to reach 5%. These aren't venture bets, but strategic positions tied to Ethereum's role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized asset rails. ETF flows confirm the institutional tilt. Year-to-date, ETPs tracking ETH have drawn about $12.7 billion in net inflows, with US spot Ethereum ETFs representing $12.4 billion. The infrastructure is built. The allocators are here. The 2025 research cycle has started treating ETH as yield-bearing infrastructure rather than a levered bet on tokens. Citi's September note setting a $4,300 year-end target is explicit: the driver is demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins and tokenization, not speculative trading. The bank highlights staking yield as a differentiator for corporate portfolios, sketching a bull case to $6,400 if stablecoin adoption evolves on the optimistic trajectory. Binance Research argued that if stablecoin settlement and layer-2 scaling continue on current trends, ETH's valuation logic shifts from “deflationary asset” to “ecological infrastructure asset.” Data from rwa.xyz shows that Ethereum controls $12.5 billion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market, equivalent to 66.6%. Ethereum's growth in RWA tokenization since 2024 has been stellar, rising from $1.5 billion, representing a 735% increase from its current size. Stablecoin usage also skyrocketed. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum recorded $1.6 trillion in monthly stablecoin transaction volume as of Dec. 21 and $172.1 billion in stablecoin supply. Supply growth is 141% compared to the $71.3 billion seen in January 2024. The thesis emerging from these reports is consistent: ETH is increasingly treated like a yield-bearing, rails-of-the-system asset in professional portfolios. It's about needing Ethereum to function as plumbing for tokenized dollars, securities, and derivatives that institutions are already building. NFTs are the clearest cultural contrast. Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT art sales plunging from nearly $16.5 billion in 2021 to just $2.2 billion in 2025, a drop of roughly 87%. LG shut down its Art Lab NFT marketplace, Tennis Australia's Artball collection saw floor prices collapse by around 90%, and CryptoPunks were transferred to a non-profit, with coverage bluntly observing that the “money-making days” are over. Google Trends data shows that crypto-related searches in the US remain well below prior-cycle peaks, rising to 100 only when prices grind higher between July and August. The participation mix confirms the shift. Retail mania has rotated heavily into US single-stock trading rather than altcoins. Ethereum ETP flows swing between huge inflow weeks and very large outflow weeks, more like a tug-of-war between structured products than a one-way retail stampede. The mismatch between accumulation and attention creates a medium-term puzzle. Traditional price discovery depends on a mix of fundamental flows and narrative momentum. Ethereum in 2025 has the former without the latter. ETFs and treasuries provide slow, steady demand. Staking locks up supply, and tokenization brings real-world assets to Ethereum. But the cultural engine that drove 2021, consisting of retail users treating every transaction like a statement, has stalled. This matters because Ethereum's valuation has always been partly reflexive. The network becomes more valuable as more applications build on it, partly because developers expect it to grow in value. That virtuous cycle depends on momentum, not just infrastructure. When corporate buyers treat ETH as a tool to settle tokenized bonds rather than a bet on the future of finance, they stabilize the asset but flatten its narrative arc. The wire shows ETH buying. The data shows supply draining from exchanges. What's missing is the cultural proof that any of this matters to anyone outside the trade. Ethereum may be transitioning from a speculative layer-1 to financial plumbing, and if that's the case, the 2021 feeling might not return. The question is whether the next phase of steady, institutional, infrastructure-driven flows can sustain the valuations that retail mania once underwrote.

Title: Will XRP Hit $5 in 2026? 5 Catalysts That Could Make It Happen—And 3 Risks That Won’t

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has spent years moving in tight ranges, but 2026 is shaping up as a decisive period. With institutional interest building, new products on the horizon, and macro conditions beginning to shift, investors are asking a sharper question than ever: will XRP hit $5 in 2026? Some believe a clear set of catalysts could finally unlock that level. Others argue that the same risks that held XRP back before still apply. To understand what comes next, it helps to separate what could realistically drive a move for the XRP price to $5 from what could prevent it. Andrey Gorgots / Shutterstock.com XRP reaching $5 in 2026 requires specific drivers working together. Five catalysts are already in motion, and each one addresses a different barrier that has kept the XRP price range-bound. Speculation around a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF sits at the top of the list because of what it represents: scale, credibility, and regulated access. Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows, led by Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Market observers have pointed out that XRP-linked funds appear less sensitive to short-term macro stress, suggesting a different investor base. While BlackRock stated in August 2025 that it has no immediate plans for an XRP ETF, analysts believe regulatory clarity and sustained ETF demand could change that calculus. If BlackRock eventually moves forward, estimates suggest inflows could reach $2 billion or more. That level of capital would reshape demand and strengthen the case for XRP hitting $5. It would also position XRP as the only crypto asset with an ETF tied to a fully regulated token in the U.S. Japan is quietly becoming one of the most important regions in the long-term XRP story. Ripple and SBI Holdings plan to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by Q1 2026 through SBI VC Trade, pending regulatory approval. The project is being built through licensed trust banks and exchanges under Japan’s Payment Services Act. Japan accounts for more than half of Ripple’s global payment volume. When regulated stablecoins become part of domestic and cross-border settlement, XRPL’s role as an infrastructure gains relevance. Banks using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger create real demand for XRP as a bridge currency. This supports the XRP reaching $5 case, even if the impact builds gradually over quarters. Tokenization is where blockchain adoption moves beyond theory. Ripple’s expanded relationship with Archax—a regulated digital securities exchange—reflects this shift. The partnership aims to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tokenized equities, debt, and funds onto XRPL by mid-2026. Archax operates in a regulated environment and has already shown that tokenized traditional assets can function at scale. XRPL’s fast settlement—transactions clear in 3-5 seconds—and low fees make it suitable for this use case. Traditional securities settlement can take days and cost significantly more. As global consulting firms project tokenized assets reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. If XRPL captures even 5-10% of tokenized asset settlement, the utility demand for XRP multiplies, and this harnesses its case of reaching $5 in 2026. Macro policy remains one of the most important background forces shaping XRP’s upside potential. Expected Federal Reserve rate cuts would lower returns on cash and short-term bonds, historically pushing capital toward risk assets offering growth and liquidity. Large-cap digital assets usually benefit first from this shift, especially those with deep markets and improving regulatory clarity. XRP fits that profile—consistent volume, global recognition, and increasing institutional discussion. Rate cuts don’t cause price rallies by themselves, but they change behavior. Capital becomes more willing to take exposure, and risk tolerance rises across portfolios. In that environment, questions like “will XRP hit $5” move from speculation to portfolio debate as allocation decisions begin to shift. Supply dynamics add another layer to this outlook, and recent on-chain data makes the shift hard to ignore. Exchange-held XRP fell sharply, with 1.35 billion XRP pulled off exchanges in less than two months. Balances dropped from roughly 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than 1 billion leaving in just three weeks. This pace suggests a decisive change in behavior. Large withdrawals signal that holders are moving XRP into longer-term storage—cold wallets and institutional custody—rather than keeping it readily available for sale. While this doesn’t guarantee higher prices, it does reduce immediate sell pressure and tightens available liquidity. If demand rises through ETFs, institutional participation, or settlement-related use while supply remains constrained, price movements can accelerate. This is why exchange outflows feature so prominently in discussions about XRP’s upside potential heading into 2026. Tamisclao / Shutterstock.com Even with multiple bullish drivers in place, there are clear risks that could prevent XRP from reaching higher levels. These risks are structural and they explain why the question of XRP hitting $5 still divides investors. The largest risk remains regulation. XRP’s progress over the past year has been closely tied to improving legal clarity and regulatory acceptance following the August 2025 SEC settlement. That progress underpins institutional interest and ETF-related momentum. However, regulatory environments can change quickly. A tougher stance from U.S. regulators, new compliance requirements, or delays in XRP ETF approvals could slow institutional participation. For large investors, certainty matters more than speed, and any sign of reversal would likely pause capital inflows and weaken confidence. Ownership concentration is another important risk. XRP has a history of large holders selling into strength. When price moves higher, these holders often take profits, increasing sell pressure at key resistance levels. This behavior can flatten rallies even when broader sentiment is positive. If distribution accelerates during a breakout attempt, demand from ETFs or retail investors may struggle to absorb the supply. This dynamic has capped previous rallies and remains a real obstacle to XRP reaching the $5 target. The final risk sits outside the crypto market entirely. A global economic slowdown or recession would reduce appetite for risk assets across the board. In such conditions, investors typically rotate into cash, bonds, or defensive assets. Even strong crypto narratives struggle when liquidity tightens. If recession fears dominate in 2026—triggered by banking stress, geopolitical shocks, or persistent inflation—capital that might have flowed into digital assets could stay sidelined. You can have perfect fundamentals, but if the economy contracts, risk assets like XRP suffer. XRP reaching $5 wouldn’t come from a single headline or short burst of momentum. It would require a rare alignment of multiple forces playing out together. ETF inflows would need to remain strong and consistent, institutional adoption would have to translate into real, sustained capital commitment, macro conditions must stay supportive, supply conditions would need to remain tight, and whales would need to hold rather than distribute aggressively into strength. XRP hitting $5 requires all five catalysts to align while the three major risks stay dormant. BlackRock files an ETF, Japan launches RLUSD at scale, tokenization gains traction, the Fed cuts rates, and supply stays locked up—all while regulators stay friendly, whales hold their positions, and the economy avoids recession. It’s a narrow path, but possible. How many of these factors actually align will decide whether XRP hits $5 in 2026 or consolidates below $3 while building for a later run.

The network’s builders have historically focused on technical accomplishments and an ideal of decentralization so pure, critics say, that they can sometimes lose sight of the bigger economic and political picture. But this year, amidst seismic regulatory developments for the crypto industry, Ethereum has stealthily made huge inroads in arenas it long was perceived to have neglected. From Wall Street board rooms to social media timelines, 2025 was the year Ethereum finally conquered centralized institutions. For nearly half a decade, Wall Street veteran Vivek Raman has attempted to onboard top traditional finance players onto Ethereum. “They all told me to politely leave their offices for four years,” Raman told Decrypt. The executive figured a paradigm shift might come this year, given crypto’s newfound political influence. But even he was blown away by what 2025 reaped for Ethereum at an institutional level. “This year was validation beyond what we would have expected,” Raman said. In January, Raman co-founded Etherealize, an organization dedicated to making Ethereum “the backbone of global finance”. Over the course of this year, he said, centralized institutions have followed three significant trends when it comes to crypto. For one, they all are now “urgently” attempting to expand their businesses onto blockchain networks. Two: They have near-universally embraced Ethereum’s distinctive multi-layer network model as the way to do so. And three—perhaps most crucially—this embrace of Ethereum has come about organically, he claimed. “People have just chosen Ethereum, not because there's a [business development] team, but because it's the right place to do business,” Raman said. The success stories are almost too many to count. Base, the Coinbase-incubated layer-2 network built on Ethereum, has become one of the year's buzziest success stories in Wall Street circles. When financial services mainstay Fidelity began tokenizing assets this spring, it went with Ethereum to get the job done. So did the global banking cooperative SWIFT. And after Robinhood went all-in on offering tokenized stocks this summer, the trading giant opted to create its own layer-2 network on Ethereum. Beyond that, there’s the rest of globe: Upbit in South Korea, Ant Group in China, IHC in Abu Dhabi, Amundi in Europe, and Bailie Gifford in the UK. When those financial institutions—some of the most important in the world—dove headfirst into tokenization projects this year, they all chose Ethereum (generally via layer-2 networks) as the place to do business. Efficiency, automation, reduced counterparty risk, increased access to capital, transparency in some cases, privacy in others—there are many incentives drawing big institutions to crypto. But old school, risk-averse firms tend to move in a pack, and those in finance appear to have collectively chosen Ethereum as the default place to build on-chain this year, following similar moves made in 2024 by market leaders like BlackRock. After years of standing on the sidelines, these firms now feel emboldened to commit to Ethereum chiefly because the crypto industry has been legitimized by the U.S. government, Danny Ryan, an Etherealize co-founder and former Ethereum core developer, told Decrypt. In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a legal framework for issuing and trading stablecoins in the United States. The law had little to do with integrating complex crypto maneuvers into the traditional financial system (a separate, pending crypto market structure bill covers such issues). But the GENIUS Act blessed the general concept of crypto as permissible, or perhaps more accurately, not impermissible, Ryan said. And ever since, the crypto-cautious dam on Wall Street has burst, with or without market structure legislation. “It didn't say, ‘Hey, all the capital markets you know and love are legal to put on a blockchain,’" Ryan said of the GENIUS Act. “It just said, ‘Hey, you can do things legally on blockchains. It's legitimate.’” “After GENIUS, it's almost like the winds are at our back,” Raman said. It’s not just external actors who have come to see Ethereum differently in 2025. Internally, leaders of the Ethereum Foundation have also made huge shifts this year, in an effort to revamp the network’s global image. “There were a lot of unhappy people internally and externally,” James Smith, the Ethereum Foundation’s head of ecosystem, told Decrypt of the nonprofit’s previous woes. For years, even Ethereum’s advocates complained that the network’s foundation had become mired in an isolated, holier-than-thou “ivory tower” approach—one that turned off key centralized institutions and small-scale crypto founders alike. Smith’s job this year has been to completely reinvent how the Ethereum Foundation engages with the rest of the world. “We’ve become much more intentional about how we engage with institutions in 2025,” he said. “We now have teams whose job is to help serious builders and enterprises plug into Ethereum.” Take, for instance, a new initiative at the Foundation to host one-day conferences focused on appealing to big business. One upcoming event will explain staking to corporate firms in Zurich. Another, in New York, will showcase the benefits of Ethereum’s privacy features to enterprise players. While such outreach might sound like a no-brainer, Smith says these efforts represent a “180 [degree] sea change” in the Ethereum Foundation’s approach. “This is a really big moment for Ethereum,” he said, “which is why this is really needed.” One growing sector that has become increasingly central to Ethereum this year—and thus to the Ethereum Foundation—has been artificial intelligence. As the AI agent economy takes off, Ethereum's developers are betting that bots will eventually become the network’s core user base. This fall, the Foundation launched a full-time team dedicated to AI—which is rolling out collaborations with tech giants including Google. Such alliances might seem counterintuitive for a network that has long pitched itself as a democratic alternative to the hyper-centralized power structures of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. But Davide Crapis, the head of Ethereum’s AI team, doesn’t see the network’s growing popularity among tech and financial elites as a problem. On the contrary, he sees it as an inevitable outcome of the network’s rise to dominance. “The focus needs to be on building the best decentralized technology we can offer,” Crapis said. “When they see the value, they will come.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Are altcoins coming back? Why 'Bitcoin season' has staying power in 2026
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-altcoins-coming-back-why-bitcoin-season-has-staying-power-in-2026

Crypto traders and several metrics suggest that an altcoin season is nowhere to be seen as institutions help Bitcoin strengthen its grip on the market. Cointelegraph in your social feed Most altcoins are currently displaying bearish patterns that suggest “altcoin season” is not coming, according to numerous analysts, as Bitcoin dominance begins to rise again. Key takeaways: The Supertrend indicator flashes “sell,” which previously led to a 66% drop in the altcoin total market cap. Rising BTC dominance and a low altcoin season index show no signs of reversal. The ongoing sell-off in altcoins is reflected by the correction in TOTAL2, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin (BTC), that began on Oct. 10. Data from TradingView shows that TOTAL2 has decreased by 32% to $1.19 trillion in December from its all-time high of $1.77 trillion reached on Oct. 10. This drop has seen TOTAL2 lose above key support levels, including the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) currently at $1.3 trillion, as shown in the chart below. Related: Crypto altseason unlikely in 2026 as ‘blue-chip survivors’ to win out: Analyst The SuperTrend indicator also flashed a bearish signal when it reversed from red to green and moved above the price in mid-November. This indicator overlays the chart while tracking TOTAL2’s trend, like the moving averages. It incorporates the average true range in its calculations, which helps traders identify market trends. Previous confirmations from these two indicators were followed by 85.5% and 66% drawdowns during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets, as shown in the chart below. Altcoins are still stuck in the downtrend as TOTAL2 consolidates within an ascending triangle. “Altcoin market cap is coiling into a brutal downtrend,” Merlijn The Trader wrote in an X post analysis. Support at $1.15 trillion is holding for now, but “if this triangle breaks, we could see a -30% flush” to $830 billion, the analyst wrote, adding that the “altseason is not coming” until the resistance at $1.68 trillion is broken. “Alt season will never occur again,” wrote CryptoDaddi in a recent post on X, adding that going forward, money will be concentrated into a select few altcoins. Bitcoin's (BTC) grip on the cryptocurrency market has tightened in 2025, leaving little room for altcoins to outperform. After pushing past 65% in June, Bitcoin dominance, a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market share relative to the overall crypto market, dropped to 57% in September. Since then, the metric has been on an upward trend, recording higher highs and higher lows, as shown in the chart below. At the time of publication, BTC dominance is at 59.27%, indicating that it is still Bitcoin season. This metric has not dropped below 50% since September 2023, which has previously marked the start of the altseason. This is a structural shift driven by institutional adoption that came after the approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions from traditional finance. Institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity prioritize Bitcoin for its adoption, relative stability and regulatory clarity, viewing altcoins as riskier and less liquid. It’s not just aggressive buying by Strategy either. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF attracted over $25 billion in inflows in 2025, reinforcing the preference corporate buyers have for BTC over altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is printing a higher low, and money is rotating back into BTC, not alts,” said CyrilXBT in an X post, adding: Meanwhile, key indicators the crypto industry uses to determine an incoming altcoin season suggest it’s still nowhere in sight. According to Capriole Investments’ Altcoin Speculation Index, only 21% of the top altcoins have outperformed BTC during the last three-month period, suggesting capitulation among altcoin holders. Additionally, the Crypto Market Breadth, a measure of market strength, reveals that only 8% of all altcoins are trading above their 50-day moving average, suggesting that the altcoin market is extremely weak. Similarly, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which measures the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days, is reading a score of 18 out of 100, leaning toward a more Bitcoin-dominated market, referring to it as “Bitcoin Season.” Altcoin season is when the percentage is above 75%. “CMC Altcoin Season Index is at a record low,” said altcoin trader Money Ape in an analysis on X, adding: As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has outperformed most other cryptocurrency sectors in recent months, indicating that capital and investment continue to favor Bitcoin.

Title: Paramount's new offer for Warner Bros 'not sufficient'
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1223/1550321-paramounts-new-offer-for-warner-bros-not-sufficient/

Paramount Skydance's latest offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery still is not good enough for prominent shareholder Harris Oakmark, the investor has told Reuters. Warner Bros' fifth largest shareholder, owning 96 million shares or about 4% of shares as of the end of September, said it would hold out for more from the Ellison family-controlled Paramount. "The changes in Paramount's new offer were necessary, but not sufficient," Harris Oakmark portfolio manager and Director of US Research Alex Fitch said in an email to Reuters. "We see the two deals as a toss-up, and there is a cost to changing paths. If Paramount is serious about winning, they’re going to need to provide a greater incentive," he added. Paramount yesterday amended its $108.4 billion hostile bid for the storied Hollywood studio to bolster its financing. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, whose son David owns Paramount, is now personally guaranteeing $40.4 billion of the bid to secure Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max and controls the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Superman franchises. Questions about the financing, much of which was held in a revocable trust, had some Warner Bros investors unsure whether they would accept the offer. Paramount also increased the fee it will pay to $5.8 billion from $5 billion if regulators do not approve the deal, to match a competing offer from Netflix, although it did not raise its $30-a-share bid. Warner Bros investors now have until January 21, extended from January 8, to accept or reject the so-called tender offer. The board of Warner Bros unanimously recommended on Wednesday that shareholders reject Paramount's earlier bid in favor of Netflix's offer, saying the financing didn't provide a "full backstop." Even though Netflix's cash offer of $23.25 a share is lower, the board said its bid was superior because the financing was more secure and it includes $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock as well as whatever Warner Bros can get when it spins out Discovery Global as part of the deal. The bidding war speaks to the quality of Warner Bros assets, said Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of Chicago investment firm IHT Wealth Management, which owns 16,000 shares of Warner Bros, 6,500 shares of Netflix and 60,000 of Paramount. "It’s really rare to get an opportunity to add top shelf media assets to your portfolio," he said, adding that he'll likely follow the board's advice on the sale. "They know the business inside out and have a better grasp of the nuances associated with the deal than we do." Investor Thomas Poehling, who owns 484,000 shares of Warner Bros and 639,000 of Paramount, said he will likely take the revised offer if Netflix does not counter because Paramount has a better chance of winning approval from regulators.

Most people imagine Wall Street careers beginning in familiar ways: internships at major banks, economics coursework, and early exposure to markets. But some of the young professionals on Business Insider's 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street list started out somewhere entirely different, long before entering finance. One hoped to be a professional football player. Another was a collegiate golf champion with a goal of playing on all seven continents. A third conducted anthropology fieldwork in Sierra Leone. And another began in a chemistry lab before deciding research wasn't the right fit. We're looking back at this year's cohort, focusing on those whose formative professional years were spent far from trading floors and deal teams. Today, this group has gone on to find success across a spectrum of industry niches from investment banking and private equity to hedge funds and quantitative investing. Below, we're showcasing seven Rising Stars who switched careers, and how those beginnings helped steer their professional climb at firms like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and more. Their backgrounds are organized alphabetically by their last name. Lamar Cardinez, Blue Owl Before he ever worked in finance, Cardinez thought he'd play professional football. When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy. He thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance. After earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams. Cardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves. Catherine Kress, BlackRock Kress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making. Kress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a "dream job." She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute. But she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the "culmination" of her career, offering "unparalleled exposure" to global policymakers and business leaders. Jack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase Levendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron. In that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions. Josef Menasche, Goldman Sachs Menasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries. Today, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' secondaries advisory group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions. Aman Mittal, Moelis Mittal began his career studying electronics and communications engineering in India before joining Bain & Company as an analyst in its technology, media, and telecom practice. He later moved into digital-infrastructure advisory work and, at Moelis, has worked on more than 15 data-center-related transactions totaling more than $25 billion in value. His recent mandates include Apollo's acquisition of Stream Data Centers. And he helped Prime Data Centers, another platform in the space, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake to the institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. Nikunj Jain, Bridgewater Jain studied machine learning, taught undergraduate math, interned at Apple in machine learning engineering, and worked for the Department of Defense before joining Bridgewater, where he's now head of Asia research. After graduating from UC Berkeley in two and a half years, he pursued quantitative finance after a friend suggested it. He said he found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked" — a description he's shaken off by running a 15- to 20-person team synthesizing regional activity into trading signals at the giant hedge fund. Jackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley Before joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she told Business Insider. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." So she made the pivot to Wall Street. After holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks. Golf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents. Jump to

Title: Who are the frontrunners for the top Fed job?
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo
Time Published: 2025-12-23T06:01:14Z
Full Content:
The high-stakes search for a new leader of the US central bank is drawing to a close. US President Donald Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman will end in May. That person will step into the role at a tricky moment. The bank is contending with both political pressure and internal disagreement about how it should set interest rates in the months ahead. Credibility concerns could make the job even harder. Trump has made clear he wants lower borrowing costs and put unusual pressure on the Fed, raising questions about whether whoever wins the post will act independently. Trump's nominee would then go to the Senate for confirmation. Here's what to know about the frontrunners. Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as a top contender to succeed Powell. A Trump loyalist, Hassett, 63, served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. His odds of clinching the role have dropped since early December, but Wall Street traders still deem him the most likely choice. Hassett has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy and repeating allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. His allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently at the Fed and how much sway he would have with other members of the board. In a research note, Deutsche Bank economists wrote that Hassett might struggle, at least initially, to convince other policymakers to put aside concerns about inflation and cut rates meaningfully. "Other officials might be sceptical of forward-looking arguments that rely heavily on the administration's policies bringing inflation closer to target," they wrote. Even some within the Trump administration have reportedly questioned whether Hassett has the skills needed to effectively take the helm of the central bank. Hassett addressed those questions in a CNBC interview this month, saying that the Fed's independence was "really, really important", while reiterating that interest rates still had room to fall. "The way you've got to drive interest-rate movements is with consensus based on the facts and the data," he said. Kevin Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, has re-emerged in recent weeks as another potential pick. The 55 year-old economist, a fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution who serves on the board of UPS, had also been considered for Fed chair during Trump's first term. He briefly overtook Hassett in prediction markets this month before falling back to second place. "I think the two Kevins are great," Trump told the Wall Street Journal this month. Warsh has been an outspoken Fed critic, lambasting everything from the central bank's heavy reliance on data to its use of assets on its balance sheet. He has escalated his rhetoric since emerging as a contender for the top Fed job this year, calling for "regime change". Warsh had a relatively "hawkish" reputation as Fed governor, meaning that he tended to favour higher interest rates and focused on concerns about inflation. But he is now seen as a voice that would support lower rates in the near term. He has argued that the Fed should shrink its balance sheet in order to bring down short-term interest rates, though some have questioned that logic. "He thinks you have to lower interest rates," Trump told the Journal. "And so does everybody else that I've talked to." Warsh also has close family connections to Trump's orbit. His father-in-law, billionaire businessman Ronald Lauder, is a longtime Trump donor and ally. Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, recently met with Trump for an interview, boosting his chances for the job in prediction markets. He was nominated to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020 and has recently stressed that the Fed has room to lower interest rates even further. Waller, 66, lacks the personal ties that could help propel Hassett and Warsh to the top of Trump's list. Wall Street, however, has looked favourably upon his relative distance from the White House. Trump, when asked about Waller following their meeting, called him "great", adding that "he's a man who's been there a long time". While the two Kevins remain the favourites, Waller is emerging as "the more sensible choice", said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital. He noted that choosing Waller could open up two spots on the Fed board for Trump to fill next year, since Fed governor Stephen Miran's term is set to end. It remains to be seen who will satisfy the president. Other names floated include BlackRock executive Rick Reider and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In the end, no matter who emerges the winner from this contest, it may be Wall Street that serves as final judge of their success. Ukraine's leader gives an upbeat assessment after discussing the plan with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Donald Trump says thousands of Christians are being killed in Nigeria - where has he got the numbers from? Imran Ahmed was among five people accused of seeking to "coerce" US firms into censoring free speech. Rep Joyce Beatty, who sits on the centre's board, argues the name change is illegal because it requires approval from Congress.

Title: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks

BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF has featured on the $13.5 trillion asset manager's homepage, representing one of three major investment themes as the market heads into 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock says its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was one of its three biggest investment themes in 2025, putting it alongside Treasury bills and the largest US tech stocks. The asset manager named its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) alongside its ETF tracking Treasury bills and another tied to the “Magnificent 7” tech stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla. IBIT has attracted more than $25 billion in net inflows this year, ranking sixth among all ETFs and trailing broad index funds, despite the fund delivering a negative return so far for 2025. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said on Monday that BlackRock's naming IBIT signals the firm isn’t fazed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30% fall from its high set in October. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed a similar sentiment on Friday, saying if the ETF “can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year.” The $25 billion in inflows adds to the roughly $37 billion that IBIT brought in over 2024, bringing its total inflows since launch to $62.5 billion, Farside Investors data shows. IBIT’s flow tally is more than five times that of its nearest competitor, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Related: Recent Bitcoin miner capitulation may signal bottom is near: VanEck BlackRock filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September. The product seeks to sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures, collecting premiums to generate yield. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has exceeded expectations too, attracting over $9.1 billion worth of inflows this year, bringing its total tally to nearly $12.7 billion. It also filed to register an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF in November to complement ETHA. BlackRock initially opted not to incorporate staking in ETHA. However, a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission has loosened its ETF standards, allowing asset managers to experiment with new product ideas. BlackRock hasn’t participated in the altcoin ETF craze that other asset managers have taken part in, which has so far seen the likes of Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) products launch in recent months.

Title: Canada's Prime Minister Carney names financier Mark Wiseman as the next ambassador to Washington

Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that financier Mark Wiseman will be Canada's next ambassador to the U.S. Wiseman will assume the role on February 15 and will be involved in negotiations regarding the review of their free trade agreement TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced on Monday that financier Mark Wiseman will serve as the country's next ambassador to the United States, an appointment that comes at a critical time in relations between the two major trading partners. Wiseman will assume the role on Feb. 15 and will be involved in negotiations with the U.S. regarding the review of their free trade agreement. “Mark Wiseman brings immense experience, contacts, and deep commitment at this crucial time of transformation of our relationship with the United States,” Carney said in a statement. “As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions.” Wiseman replaces Kirsten Hillman, who announced her resignation earlier this month. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal during his first term in office and included a clause to possibly renegotiate it in 2026. Wiseman, 55, ran the investment fund of the Canada Pension Plan and also managed equity funds at the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. He is a friend of Carney, who ran the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013 and the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. In 2016 Wiseman became the senior managing director and global head of active equities at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Wiseman was once touted as a possible successor to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, though his tenure at the company was cut short in 2019 when he departed after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. He has since chaired the Alberta Investment Management Corp. “Mark Wiseman is a business type with Wall Street connections whose profile is in sync with the current focus on trade and economic investment of both the Carney government and the Trump administration. Yet, Wiseman has no prior diplomatic experience," said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. In October, Trump cut off tariff negotiations with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an antitariff advertisement in the U.S. It followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, as are 85% of U.S. electricity imports. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

ST PHOTO: CHONG JUN LIANG Published Dec 23, 2025, 07:40 AM Updated Dec 23, 2025, 07:36 PM LONDON – Sir James Dyson is reshaping how he manages Britain’s biggest fortune, streamlining his sprawling business empire across three continents after new leaders took the reins of his family holding company. Weybourne, the Dyson family’s investment firm, has transferred funds totalling at least £624 million (S$1.08 billion) from a major UK entity in 2025 to its Singapore holding company, reducing the British unit’s share capital to £1, according to an analysis of registry filings by Bloomberg. It has also finalised earlier plans to close two British firms overseeing property investments and transferred part of their share capital to another entity in Singapore, where Mr Dyson’s eponymous vacuum maker has its global headquarters. Meanwhile, Weybourne has posted job openings in recent weeks for a “new team” in Singapore to support a multi-asset investment portfolio and has scaled back its US footprint after spending almost US$200 million (S$257 million) on New York real estate. A representative for the 78-year-old – Britain’s richest person with a net worth of about US$16.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index – declined to comment. The changes are likely “part of a multi-year succession road map”, said Mr Martin Roll, a global family business strategist and senior adviser at McKinsey & Co. It is “long-term planning”. The moves signal that Weybourne’s new leadership is leaving its mark on Mr Dyson’s fortune, taking steps to reduce the complexity of a business empire that has rapidly expanded in recent years, after he extracted large sums from his namesake technology company to diversify his wealth. Mr Martin Bowen, a legal veteran from Dyson Group, became Weybourne’s chief executive in February following the retirement of former army officer James Bucknall, who held the role for more than a decade. Mr Martin Bowen Weybourne also promoted senior money manager Jane Simpson to chief investment officer for its financial assets in a London-based role in 2024, when former BlackRock executive Alastair Peters became chief financial officer (CFO) in a previously unreported move. Weybourne’s new team in Singapore will work with the CFO unit led by Mr Peters, who turns 43 in December and forms part of a younger set of executives at the family investment firm. Mr Bowen, a former chief legal officer at Dyson’s technology firm who is 57 in December, is a decade younger than the former CEO Mr Bucknall, highlighting how longstanding money managers of the super-rich need to hone succession plans for their own leadership as well as for their employers. At least a fifth of the world’s 500 richest people now have a family office, helping preserve fortunes totalling more than US$5 trillion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. “People forget that family offices are another family business,” said Ms Christina Wing, co-founder of Wingspan Legacy Partners, which advises billionaire dynasties. “They also need to change.” Like many family offices, Weybourne reflects its founder’s roots, bearing the name of a coastal village in the part of England where Mr Dyson grew up. The month after Mr Bowen became its CEO in February, the firm’s main British entity, Weybourne Limited, returned £24.2 million in share capital to its Singapore parent company, filings show. It withdrew a further £600 million in December, reversing a transaction between the entities four years ago that a Dyson representative previously told Bloomberg helped improve governance structures. Separately, under plans disclosed publicly in late 2024, a Weybourne property firm based in Britain closed in December after transferring ownership of its real estate investments to a Singapore entity in a £26.4 million transaction. Another property firm in Britain named after Mr Dyson’s Gloucestershire estate, Dodington Park, closed in 2025 after similarly transferring its real estate investments to the billionaire’s namesake farming business. That inflow for Dyson Farming achieved “operational efficiencies”, Weybourne Limited said in its 2024 accounts filed in October, underscoring the benefits of corporate housekeeping across the British billionaire’s empire. Mr Dyson is lining up a further diversification of his fortune, which remains mostly tied up in his technology company, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. In 2025, his vacuum maker committed to boosting its annual dividends to the billionaire’s Singapore-based Weybourne Holdings to £225 million, reversing a recent trend of declining payouts. It previously paid a £200 million dividend for 2024, its lowest total in at least seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While there has been a global boom over the past two decades in the number of family investment firms catering to the needs of the world’s ultra-rich, few are as large as Weybourne. Created in 2013, it now has more than 70 employees across teams in London and Singapore, where it set up an insurance unit three years ago to help protect Dyson’s financial affairs and has recently sought to hire staff. Weybourne last publicly disclosed net assets in the UK of £4.5 billion in 2019, when the technology firm Mr Dyson founded more than two decades ago said it was relocating its headquarters to Singapore. Its other recent job openings include a UK position on its human resources team, a rare feature among investment firms of the ultra-wealthy. “It keeps a lot in-house that peers outsource,” said Mr Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices. “Weybourne needs the bodies.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, has appointed financier and former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as Canada's ambassador to the US, ahead of major trade talks with the Trump administration. Wiseman, an experienced investment manager, takes on the task as Canada works to reset its strained relations with the US while preparing for a tense review of the current free trade deal. His appointment follows current ambassador Kirsten Hillman's announcement that she would be ending her tenure in Washington. Carney said Wiseman "brings immense experience, extensive contacts and deep commitment" to the post at a "crucial time of transformation" for Canada and the US. "As a core member of our negotiating team, he will help advance the interests of Canadian workers, businesses, and institutions, while building opportunities for both Canada and the United States," the prime minister said in a statement on Monday. The new ambassador is set to take on the role in mid-February, Carney added. Wiseman, 55, reportedly a close friend of Carney's, is currently a senior advisor and chairman of Canada at Lazard, a financial services company, and a senior advisor at Boston Consulting Group, a consultancy firm. In March, Carney added him as a member of the prime minister's council on Canada-US relations, a group formed to navigate the currently turbulent bilateral relationship. The Yale alumni also previously worked in both New York and Paris as a lawyer with law firm Sullivan & Cromwell. He is one of the co-founders of the Century Initiative, a charitable organisation that has lobbied for increased immigration levels in Canada, with the goal reaching 100 million people in the country by 2100 to support economic growth. The role with Century Initiative stirred up criticism ahead of his appointment. Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre has accused Wiseman of being "someone who proposed a policy that inflates the cost of living, takes away jobs and puts pressure on our health care system". "Why does the Prime Minister want to appoint him as ambassador to Washington?" Beyond domestic politics, Wiseman will face the currently thorny relationship between the US and Canada while in Washington. Trump halted trade talks with Canada in late October in anger over an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province of Ontario and aired in the US. Trump has imposed sector-specific tariffs on Canadian metals, lumber and automotives. He has also imposed a sweeping tariff rate of 35% on all goods, though most have been exempt under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) - known at the USMCA in the US - trade pact. A scheduled review of CUSMA is now underway, starting with public hearings and stakeholder consultations, after which Canada, the US and Mexico could agree to renew it, or let it expire. President Donald Trump has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist groups. Test your memory of 2025 in the second part of our quiz.

Terms of North American free trade deal set to be renegotiated in 2026 under shadow of US tariff policies. By News Agencies Share Save Canada has named former BlackRock executive Mark Wiseman as the new ambassador to the United States, with upcoming trade and tariff negotiations likely to dominate his tenure. In a statement on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Wiseman would help manage Canada’s relationship with the US, which has grown stormy under tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. “Mr Wiseman will be a key contributor to the government’s efforts to advance Canada-US priorities, including secure borders [and] a strengthened trade and investment relationship,” Carney said in a statement. Relations between the countries have somewhat settled after the US launched a trade war targeting Canadian goods, prompting anger at what was widely viewed as an act of economic hostility against a longtime ally. The Trump administration has targeted Canada with several rounds of tariffs, including a blanket 25 percent tariff for allegedly failing to stem migration and fentanyl flows from Canada. That came despite data showing only a tiny fraction of fentanyl smuggled into the US crosses the US-Canada border. The US subsequently imposed sweeping tariffs on automobiles, steel and aluminium imports, all of which disproportionately affected Canada. In August, Trump and Carney, who was elected on a promise to take a tough stance in the face of US threats, reached agreements to roll back some of the measures. A more comprehensive deal has remained elusive. Trump has also stirred anger by repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st US state, which Carney has firmly rejected. Those tensions could re-emerge in the coming months as officials set out to renegotiate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, also known as the USMCA. Canadian officials are set to begin discussions with US counterparts in mid-January on the USMCA, which currently exempts many key products that would otherwise be tariffed under Trump’s policies. Canada is the top export destination for 36 US states, with nearly $2.7bn worth of goods and services crossing the border each day. Carney has hedged his expectations for the future of trade relations with the US, saying that Canada will defend its economic interests but that US policy is beyond its control.

Title: Trump Loses GOP Support on China Policy

Donald Trump is wrecking so much with his blend of impulsivity and personal graft and vanity that it is sometimes hard to distinguish the consequential from the incidental. Far more important than his plastering his name everywhere is Trump’s incoherent China policy, where he keeps raising and lowering tariffs to no strategic purpose while at the same time giving away crown jewels or finding a way to sell them. More from Robert Kuttner Earlier this month, there was widespread outrage in the defense community when Trump reversed policy and allowed Nvidia to sell the H200 in China, its second most advanced artificial intelligence chip. Seven Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a letter warning that “the President’s dangerous decision to give away crucial national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities.” The decision to allow the sale followed months of courtship and flattery of Trump by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Nvidia used a brand-new tech conference in D.C. to lavish praise on Trump, and Huang gave generously to Trump’s ballroom project and has claimed that Trump is ushering in a new Industrial Revolution (his words) with AI. The H200 decision came right after an Oval Office meeting between Huang and Trump. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In line with Trump’s habit of asking private companies to pay tribute, Nvidia will kick back 25 percent “revenue share” of the value of its China sales to the U.S. government. This doesn’t go directly into Trump’s pocket. But in the great favor bank, Trump will find ways to cash in this favor to Huang for his personal enrichment. Now, however, Congress has pushed back big-time. In the annual defense authorization bill that Trump has just signed into law, a broad bipartisan coalition inserted provisions codifying a 2023 Biden executive order requiring national-security screening of outbound U.S. capital investment in China. In past years, U.S. venture capital firms have supplied a lot of the funds for AI development in China. Funds managed by Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have major investments in China’s marquee tech company, Alibaba. The authorization bill does not reverse the Nvidia chip approval, but it sends a shot across Trump’s bow and signals more willingness of Republicans to defect from automatic support for Trump. In supporting the new restrictions, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned, “Every dollar invested in China by a United States investor into a Chinese company is a dollar that’s going toward the potential production of weapons and technology that one day may be used to kill Americans.” Congress needs to go further and ban sweetheart deals like the Nvidia waiver. Meanwhile, Trump is pulling back on technologies where China increasingly dominates, such as EVs and renewable energy. His treatment of the Caribbean as an American lake and Ukraine as part of greater Russia is a virtual invitation for China to invade Taiwan. While Trump is obsessed with Venezuela as a national-security threat and imposes vanity tariffs on friendly nations like Canada that fall short of his standards of genuflection, militarily and commercially he is letting China clean America’s clock.
